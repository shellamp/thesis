Faye Louise, from Horsham, West Sussex, began planning her own funeral after doctors found a tumour in her appendix in 2023. But after \"the mother of all surgeries\", she said she was cancer free and able to return to work as a flight dispatcher at Gatwick Airport. \"To have been told there is no evidence of disease, it was the greatest Christmas gift that I could have got,\" she said.\n\nMs Louise added that she was unsure if she'd be able to work again this time last year. \"The job is very physical, but I love aviation and I'm happy that I'm back in the role,\" she told BBC Radio Sussex.\n\nCancer Research UK Faye Louise said she was \"cancer free\" having been diagnosed with pseudomyxoma peritonei in 2023\n\nThe former model began to have pains in spring 2023, which she initially put down to period problems, before an ultrasound revealed an ovarian cyst. However, after an operation to rectify the problems, she said she \"heard the dreaded C-word\" and was diagnosed with pseudomyxoma peritonei \u2013 a rare tumour that causes a build-up of a jelly-like substance in the abdomen. As the tumour had ruptured, spreading cancer cells around her body, Ms Louise needed an operation which involved removing eight of her organs. The surgery included the removal of her spleen, gallbladder, appendix, ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, belly button, greater and lesser omentum - which connect the stomach and duodenum to other abdominal organs - and part of her liver, as well as the scraping of her diaphragm and pelvis. She will continue to have yearly scans every November as a result. \"Waiting for the results will sadly make or break every Christmas for me. But you just have to keep pushing forward and never give up,\" she said. \"Some days I have been down to the depths of despair, but more often than not now, I'm having more positive days.\"\n\nCancer Research UK Faye Louise has been fundraising for Cancer Research UK\n\nShe has since returned to work, and fundraised for Cancer Research UK \u2013 including being gunged with 15 litres of orange gloop in the garden of the Red Lyon pub in Slinfold. She has also completed the Race for Life in Stanmer Park, Brighton, to raise funds for the charity.\n\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

The National Institute for Healthcare and Care Excellence (NICE) is recommending a daily tablet that has been shown to reduce symptoms. Dr Helen Evans-Howells, a Bournemouth GP and expert in allergy patients, said the evidence \"clearly\" showed the treatment was an \"effective solution\". The tablet, known as Acarizax, is the first of its kind according to a statement released by NICE.\n\nThe institute has published its recommendations for the tablet, made by ALK-Abello, which is an option to treat moderate-to-severe house dust mite allergic rhinitis. An estimated 13,000 people suffer from the allergy in England and this new treatment will be suitable for those between 12 and 65 years old.\n\nDr Helen Evans-Howells Dr Helen Evans-Howells said the treatment could be life-changing for dust mite allergy sufferers\n\nDr Evans-Howells said she had \"lived experience\" of allergies. She explained: \"This drug could be life-changing for those affected by severe symptoms which include significant fatigue, congestion, and facial swelling. \"The evidence clearly shows it offers an effective solution for those who have struggled with standard treatments.\" Acarizax, which would be available via the NHS in England, works by increasing the body's resistance to house dust mites. NICE said clinical trials showed the treatment was \"particularly beneficial\" for those whose symptoms cannot be managed by standard treatments, like steroid nasal sprays and antihistamines. Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said: \"This is a chronic, debilitating condition which can prevent people from going to their workplace or school. \"This medicine has been found to improve symptoms, helping people to live their lives and has potential to be truly life changing.\" Amena Warner, Head of Clinical Services at Allergy UK, added: \"Although initial access to a specialist allergy service will mainly be required to commence treatment, importantly it can be continued as a home treatment, without the need for frequent hospital visits which incur travel and time costs. \"The patient benefit will be far reaching, and we welcome this decision.\"",

    "body": "Badenoch criticises Tory handling of Brexit\n\n16 January 2025 Share Save Sam Francis Political reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch has criticised her predecessors for mishandling Brexit, saying leaving the EU without a growth plan was a \"mistake\". In her first major speech of 2025, Badenoch attacked the Labour's government but also her own party for repeatedly pledging to lower immigration as numbers \"kept going up\" and for promising net zero carbon emissions by 2050 without a clear plan. Badenoch pledged to tell hard truths \"even when it's difficult to hear\" to restore trust with the public. Labour chairwoman Ellie Reeves accused the Tory leader of \"doing the exact opposite\" of rebuilding trust - offering nothing in opposition but more \"infighting\".\n\nBadenoch said the public \"will never trust politicians unless we can accept our mistakes\". \"I will acknowledge the Conservative Party made mistakes,\" she said. Badenoch has not named who she holds responsible, but in her speech said: \"We announced that we would leave the European Union before we had a plan for growth outside the EU. \"We made it the law that we would deliver net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And only then did we start thinking about how we would do that. \"We announced that we would lower immigration, but immigration kept going up. \"These mistakes were made because we told people what they wanted to hear first and then tried to work it out later. \"That is going to stop under my leadership. If we are going to turn our country around, we're going to have to say some things that aren't easy to hear.\"\n\nBadenoch served as a minister under her three Conservative prime ministers - Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. A committed Brexiteer she voted for both Johnson and Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement after becoming an MP in 2017. She served as international trade secretary under Truss, responsible for landing post-Brexit trade deals and promoting UK exports globally. Badenoch retained the post under Sunak who added the business and women and equalities briefs.\n\nBadenoch claimed that as business secretary, she helped the Tory government scrap \"about 4,000 EU laws\" and end the \"supremacy of the European Court of Justice\". But she admitted she left office with unfinished work. \"What we need to start doing is looking at where we have competitive advantage with countries around the world and use our regulatory system to exploit that competitive advantage,\" she said. Badenoch said she would \"back\" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \"if he does the right thing using Brexit\". \"I do not care who gets the credit - we just have to start getting our country back on track,\" she said.\n\nBadenoch used her speech to draw a sharp contrast with Sir Keir, who she claims \"does not believe he's ever made a mistake\". She attacked Labour for announcing policies without a plan to back them up. \"When you haven't worked out what you're going to do in opposition, you will accept whatever you're given in government,\" she said. \"That's why Rachel Reeves announced mad and bad ideas on snatching winter fuel and taxing family farms. \"Those options were presented to us, time and time again by officials, and we rejected them time and time again because they would hurt so many people for so little benefit.\" Badenoch, who was elected Tory leader in November, has previously said she will focus on rebuilding voters' trust before announcing her own policies. In her November victory speech, Badenoch promised to \"renew\" the party by returning the Conservatives to \"first principles\". Responding to her latest comments, Ellie Reeves said: \"The public rightly lost trust in the Conservatives after 14 long years of failure in government.\" She accused Badenoch of offering \"another speech, but no apology for her role in Liz Truss' disastrous mini-Budget that crashed the economy and left a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances\". \"The Conservatives under Kemi Badenoch have nothing to offer in opposition apart from recklessly continuing to make unfunded spending commitments and overseeing yet more Conservative chaos and infighting.\"\n\nIn a media Q&A after her speech, Badenoch faced criticism that she had struck a \"depressing\" and \"joyless\" tone, giving Nigel Farage and Reform UK room to champion right-wing politics with a positive spin. She said Farage \"has had a head start\" after \"knocking around for 20 plus years\" as the leader of UKIP, the Brexit Party and now Reform UK. \"I have been leading the Conservative Party for 10 weeks - let's see where we are in a few months and a few years,\" she said. Badenoch also dismissed the idea of the Tories merging with Reform UK, saying: \"Nigel Farage says he wants to destroy the Conservative Party, why on earth would we merge with that?\"",

Sam Eljamel left some with life-changing injuries while head of neurosurgery at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. Former patient Jules Rose, who has become a leading campaigner for victims, met with the Lord Advocate on Monday to discuss the long-running police probe. She told BBC Scotland News that Dorothy Bain KC confirmed the surgeon's employers, NHS Tayside, were also being investigated for criminal charges.\n\nSpeaking after the two-hour meeting, Ms Rose said: \"The Lord Advocate was very open and honest, and did say it's anticipated Operation Stringent would take another one-and-a-half to two years before any decision is made on criminality. \"What was welcoming to hear is that it's not just Eljamel being investigated, but it's also NHS Tayside.\" Ms Rose said she was \"very happy\" at how the meeting had gone, and that Ms Bain agreed to provide a timeline for the investigation, in an attempt to speed up the probe. She added: \"They are seeking to appoint more medical expert witnesses to assist with the medical records of the patients, and that was very welcoming to hear.\" It is believed Eljamel now works in Libya. He was head of neurosurgery at Ninewells until December 2013, when he was suspended. However a due diligence review into the health board found NHS Tayside placed him under indirect supervision in June 2013 rather than suspending him, meaning he was able to operate for a further six months. It was during that period that he twice operated on Ms Rose.\n\nJules Rose was operated on twice by Eljamel during a time he was under investigation",

    "body": "Calorie labels have small effect on eating habits - study\n\n17 January 2025 Share Save Philippa Roxby and Hannah Karpel Health reporters Share Save\n\nGetty Images Calories must now appear on menus in large restaurants and take-aways\n\nPutting calories on food labels and menus \"is no silver bullet\", say researchers who analysed the best evidence to date on how effective the policy can be. A review of 25 studies on calorie labelling in a number of countries found a small reduction in the calories people chose to eat - equivalent to two almonds - but even this modest effect could help prevent adults putting on weight as they get older. The new rules on calorie labelling came into force in England in 2022 as part of government plans to encourage people to make healthier choices. The government said it would continue to evaluate the impact, including on people with eating disorders.\n\nRestaurants, cafes and take-aways with more than 250 staff must now show how many calories are in meals on their menus. For Imara, a 27-year-old HR assistant from Birmingham, the change has been a positive part of her weight-loss journey. \"It has meant that I have been able to stay on track, stay within my calorie deficit and still enjoy a nice meal out with friends, or with my husband, and still have a good time and not worry about falling off track. \"Sometimes I will just have a meal and not think about the calories,\" she says. \"But if it is a day or a week where I do want to stay on track then I will look at the calories and see whether it is something that will fit within my goals.\"\n\nImara says calories can help her focus on her weight-loss goals\n\nThe research looked at studies of the impact of calorie labels in supermarkets, restaurants and other food outlets in countries including the United States, UK, Canada and France. In a 600-calorie meal, it found an average reduction of 11 calories (or 1.8%) in the food people chose and bought. Senior author Dr Gareth Hollands from University College London, said there was \"a small but potentially meaningful effect on people's food choices\" but \"we should not expect miracles\". He said calorie labelling \"may have a useful role\" alongside other measures, such as taxes on food and drinks, marketing restrictions and reformulation - making manufacturers adjust recipes for food products to make them healthier. Dr Natasha Clarke of Bath Spa University, who began the project at the University of Cambridge, says the evidence is \"robust\". And as calorie labelling becomes more widespread, the effect could have a \"meaningful contribution\" to public health.\n\n'Toxic way to look at food'\n\nMilly Goldsmith Milly says counting calories is what drove her eating disorder",

Her uncle, Gadi Moses, was taken hostage by Hamas fighters from his home in southern Israel on 7 October 2023. But there is now very real hope for his release, after Israel and Hamas agreed a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. Despite the deal, which should see all the hostages held by Hamas released in stages, families remain cautious.\n\n\"Controlled optimism\" are the words Ms Machikawa used to explain how she was feeling after hearing the news. She described the negotiations as a \"rollercoaster\". \"We hardly breathe,\" she said, adding she had no idea when her uncle would be released. \"I believe Gadi will be fine. It will take time but he will be hugged so warmly and slowly. Together we shall overcome.\"\n\nPhoto supplied Gadi Moses was taken hostage by Hamas fighters from his home in southern Israel on 7 October 2023\n\nIn Tel Aviv, a square that has often been packed with protesters demanding the release of the hostages was empty soon after the ceasefire and hostage release deal was announced. The agreement is expected to be approved by the Israeli cabinet, after which the ceasefire is expected to happen in three stages. The first phase would last six weeks and see 33 hostages - including women, children and elderly people - exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and a return to \"sustainable calm\" - would start on the 16th day. The third and final stage would involve the reconstruction of Gaza and the return of any remaining hostages' bodies.\n\n\"We actually don't know anything. It's scary,\" said Yosi Schnaider, cousin of hostage Shiri Bibas, who was abducted with her two children and husband. \"We don't know if they're on the list, if they're going to come back in the first phase.

    "body": "Survivors return as world remembers Auschwitz 80 years after liberation\n\n26 January 2025 Share Save Paul Kirby Reporting from Auschwitz Share Save\n\nBBC Conditions at Birkenau are harsh in January and organisers have erected a tent on the site to protect them\n\nAbout 50 survivors of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau will return to the site on Monday to remember the day it was finally liberated on 27 January 1945. They will be joined by heads of state including King Charles and other European royalty, Emmanuel Macron of France and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. But it will be the survivors - most in their late 80s and 90s - not the dignitaries, whose voices will be heard during the commemorations at the camp, where 1.1 million people were murdered, most of them Jews. Their message is to tell the world what happened here and ensure that it never happens again.\n\n\"Every soul on this earth has the right to live,\" says Jona Laks, who is now 94 and arrived with her twin and elder sisters in 1944. \"Auschwitz was a laboratory for killing people. This was its task and it proved itself: few survived Auschwitz.\"\n\nClaims Conference Jona Laks, now 94, survived the medical experiments of Josef Mengele at Auschwitz\n\nAlthough daytime temperatures in recent days have climbed well above freezing and much of the snow has melted, many of the 50 arriving for Monday's commemorations are now too frail to stay in the open for long. Instead, an enormous, heated tent has been erected over the \"Death Gate\", as the entrance to Birkenau is known. The day will begin with survivors and Polish President Andrzej Duda laying a wreath at \"Death Wall\" at the first Auschwitz camp, where thousands of Polish prisoners, Jews and Soviet prisoners of war were shot. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer laid a wreath here recently and it was still there at the weekend. The scene will later move to the death camp at Birkenau, known as Auschwitz II. Each big anniversary to mark the camp's liberation by Soviet troops is different. Thirty years ago, there was far less international interest, as renowned writer Elie Wiesel led a large group of fellow survivors and relatives to one of the crematoria blown up by the Nazis before they fled.\n\nUS States Holocaust Memorial Museum This aerial photo of Birkenau from December 21 1944 shows how the Nazis had already begun to destroy the gas chambers and crematoria\n\nGerman historian Susanne Willems speaks lovingly of the survivors she has met over several decades: \"Many were like favourite grandfathers to me. Of course we've lost many of them and it's my duty to carry on and become their witness.\" There will be no political speeches from international leaders beside the Death Gate, and no Russian presence because of the full-scale war launched against Ukraine almost three years ago, even though the camp was liberated by the Russian-dominated 60th Army of the First Ukrainian Front. Vladimir Putin attended the 60th anniversary; he is not welcome now. The Nazis' decision to wipe out Europe's Jewish population in extermination camps went into operation early in 1942. Six were built in occupied Poland: at Chelmno, Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka, Majdanek and Auschwitz-Birkenau. Treblinka was far smaller than Auschwitz, and yet 800,000-850,000 Jews were murdered there in a far shorter period. Heinrich Himmler, supreme chief of the dreaded SS, and camp commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss oversaw the expansion of the Auschwitz complex to construct a second camp at Birkenau for industrial murder. By the end of 1942 there were four separate gas chambers and crematoria.\n\nSome of the blocks for the Nazis' prisoners at Auschwitz-Birkenau are still intact\n\nThe first mass deportations of Jews to Birkenau came from Slovakia and France in March 1942, and then in July from the Netherlands and Belgium as well, walking under the notorious sign Arbeit macht frei (Work sets you free) at Auschwitz and on to their deaths in the new camp. Soon trains would arrive at Birkenau at a specially constructed ramp, a short distance away from two gas chambers, and at one point 12,000 Jews were being gassed and their bodies burned every day. Jona Laks had already lost her parents at Chelmo and arrived in 1944 with her twin sister Miriam and elder sister Chana from the Lodz ghetto further north. \"I was ordered to go to the left, which meant the crematorium, whereas my twin was sent to the right. That was only because the man was so bored, he would say 'Left, right, left, right' not even looking at the the people. I didn't know that left meant death, but I did know it wasn't good,\" she told the BBC.\n\nJona Laks Jona Laks (L), with twin sister Miriam, survived the Lodz Ghetto, Auschwitz and the death march\n\nEighty to 90% of new arrivals were sent to their deaths while others were selected for slave labour. \"I was already very close to the gate; I could see the sparks, fire coming out of the chimneys and I could even feel the smell of burned flesh.\" Jona Laks was saved only because her elder sister shouted out that she should not be separated from her twin and word reached the infamous Nazi \"Angel of Death\" at the camp, Josef Mengele, who used part of Birkenau for often deadly medical experiments on twins. Women and children, the elderly and infirm were sent immediately to the gas chambers. My own grandfather, on the first Dutch transport, survived slave labour for a month and a day, until 18 August 1942. His sister, Geertje van Hasselt, her school headteacher husband Simon, and their two daughters Hermi, 14 , and nine-year-old Sophia were murdered on arrival on 12 February 1943.\n\nHermi van Hasselt was 14 when she was murdered, her sister Sophia was nine\n\nAlmost a million European Jews were murdered here from 1941 to 1945. But the dead also include some 70,000 Polish prisoners, 21,000 Roma and 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, and an unknown number of gay men. Auschwitz drew 1.83 million visitors last year and although it is closed for the commemoration large numbers walked around the museum spread out in many of the old blocks across Auschwitz 1 at the weekend, and then the desolate, sprawling site of Birkenau.\n\nThe scale of the site is daunting. The remains of many of the blocks are cordoned off, with brick foundations all that is left as you peer into the distance. But the ruins of two gas chambers and crematoria remain, blown up as the Nazis sought to destroy the evidence. \"It makes you feel anxious being here. You don't realise how sad it is until you see it,\" said a young woman with a group of friends from Lancashire, all aged 18.\n\nAbigail, Siah, Molly, Eve and Millie visited the site of the Birkenau death camp at the weekend\n\n\"Obviously you learn about it, but it's crazy when you see it in real life,\" said another. \"It's crazy to think that some people don't think it exists.\" Far-right parties have made big advances in several European countries, not least in Germany, where Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) is in second place in opinion polls ahead of next month's election. Historian Susanne Willems, who has for years brought groups to Auschwitz, last week took a group of police from Berlin to Auschwitz to explain the rise of Nazism and how any military-type of hierarchy runs the risk of moving into authoritarianism. \"I'm doing this work to help these people have a clear understanding of what the limits of police action need to be, and that whatever they're asked to do, it remains their own decision whether to obey or not; and that they have the right, in fact the duty, to refuse anything that is, from their understanding, against human rights.\" Hours before the commemorations at Auschwitz, Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged to make Holocaust education in the UK \"a truly national endeavour\", to defend the truth against anyone denying it. \"We will ensure all schools teach it and seek to give every young person the opportunity to hear a recorded survivor testimony, because by learning from survivors we can develop that empathy for others and that appreciation of our common humanity, which is the ultimate way to defeat the hatred of difference.\"\n\nThe ruins of the sprawling Birkenau site stretch far into the distance",

    "body": "Disabled man completes South Pole trek\n\n7 January 2025 Share Save Share Save\n\nAntarctic Logistics & Expeditions (ALE) Jonny Huntington reached the South Pole after enduring extreme conditions and 24-hour sunlight\n\nA former GB para athlete has become the first disabled person to ski solo and unsupported to the South Pole. Jonny Huntington, from Kingsbridge, Devon, covered 566 miles (911km) of Antarctic ice in 46 days despite the effects of a debilitating stroke he suffered in 2014. The 38-year-old set off from Fuchs-Messner on 21 November 2024 and arrived at the South Pole on Monday. Throughout his expedition, he skied in extreme conditions, including freezing temperatures and 24-hour sunlight, while dragging a 242lb (110kg) sled carrying his food and equipment.\n\nSpeaking via a satellite phone on arrival at the South Pole, Mr Huntington said: \"It's been a bit of a whirlwind since getting here. It's pretty emotional. \"My right leg is pretty sore, which I think is probably reasonable, because it's done most of the work.\" Only 52 people have successfully skied to the South Pole without support but Mr Huntington is understood to be the first explorer with a disability to do so. A former Army officer, Mr Huntington was left paralysed from the neck down on his left side when he suffered a stroke at the age of 28.\n\nIt took years of rehabilitation before he was able to fully walk again and he was left with restricted movement down his left side. He said the final stage of his expedition was much more challenging because he encountered huge ice formations called sastrugi, as well as soft snow, which made progress difficult.\n\nJonny Huntington Carrying equipment, Jonny Huntington had to ski for nine to 11 hours per day\n\n\"This has been tough, the injury has certainly made it more difficult,\" said Mr Huntington. \"In the last couple of weeks I have been in a position where I've worried if my good side is going to survive this.\" During his stroke recovery, Mr Huntington became a member of the Armed Forces Para-Snowsport Team (AFPST), which ignited his love for skiing.\n\n'Refused to stop'\n\nHe went on to join the GB para Nordic ski team, competing between 2017 and 2020 at World Cups in Lviv, Ukraine, and Vuokatti, Finland, as well as the inaugural European Paralympic Committee Games in Poland in 2020. The idea for the South Pole expedition came after he stopped skiing competitively and he planned and trained for the expedition for five years. He said: \"I don't think I've pushed any boundaries in the sense of the route I've done, or anything like that - but, at the same time, I've dragged a pretty mangled body through that route. \"I'm just a normal bloke from South Devon - like, there is no magic formula and there's nothing special about me to enable me to have done what I've done. \"On this trip, I kept putting one foot in front of the other until I got to the end. \"When things were really tough, I just refused to stop putting one foot in front of the other.\" Mr Huntington said he was looking forward to celebrating his achievement with a steak and a glass of red wine.",

    "title": "Saving a species: Slow return of the Iberian lynx",
    "body": "Saving a species: The slow return of the Iberian lynx\n\n6 January 2025 Share Save Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes BBC News, Portugal Share Save\n\nCNRLI Navarro the male lynx, photographed here by a camera trap\n\nWith his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap. Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago. \"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal. At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age. \"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\" The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food. Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number. By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity. It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve. Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction. Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept. Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.\n\nCNRLI The clinic in Silves makes sure the lynxes are ready for life in the wild\n\n\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\" That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\" So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre. Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild. Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain. Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years. \"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\" The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too. As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.\n\nBBC/Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing lynxes to Portugal\n\nWhere the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many. \"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\" He recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal. For six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him. He eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally. As L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve. Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain. For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.\n\nBBC/Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes The lynxes are monitored with camera traps and tracking apps\n\nWhen he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again. \"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento. Three decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035. For that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild. \"I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,\" says Sarmento. The reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads. For now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.",

sometimes though stress is exactly what the lynxes need cnrli the clinic in silves makes sure the lynxes are ready for life in the wild when we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences says serra were training them not to get close to people in the wild thats partly for their own protection but also so they stay away from people and their animals a lynx should be a lynx not be treated like a house cat so the lynxes never associate food with people they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre then when the time comes they are released into the wild genetics determines where they end up to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease even if a lynx was born in portugal it might be taken to spain pedro sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in portugal and has studied the iberian lynx for 30 years as a biologist there are two things that strike me when im handling a lynx its an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws that gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare the breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes but as their numbers climb there may be problems too as lynxes are often released on private land in portugal the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first bbcant\u00f3nio fernandes pedro sarmento is responsible for reintroducing lynxes to portugal where the animals go after that is up to them and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops sarmento says there have not been many this can lead to uneasiness within locals weve been strengthening the coops so lynxes cant access them and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed he recounts the story of l\u00edtio one of the first lynxes released in portugal for six months l\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him he eventually made his way to do\u00f1ana a national park in southern spain where he had come from originally as l\u00edtio was sick he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the algarve within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to do\u00f1ana swimming across the guadiana river to reach spain for a time he disappeared but eventually he was brought back to the algarve bbcant\u00f3nio fernandes the lynxes are monitored with camera traps and tracking apps when he was released for a third time l\u00edtio did not venture back to spain but instead he walked 3km two miles found a female and never moved again he is the oldest lynx we have here and hes fathered plenty of cubs ever since says sarmento three decades after spain decided to save the lynx the species is no longer endangered and sarmento hopes itll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035 for that to happen the numbers need to reach 50006000 in the wild i saw the species disappearing its surreal that were in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily says sarmento the reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work last year 80 of lynx deaths took place on the roads for now though they feel confident the iberian lynx has been saved",
    "summary": "Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight.\n\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.\nA National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.\nPedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.\nFor now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.",

The four-day promotion, which starts this Saturday (4 January), includes discounts of as much as 500 yuan ($68.50, \u00a355.30) on some of the US technology giant's newest handsets. Chinese phone maker Huawei has also cut prices of its high-end mobile devices by as much as 20%. The discounts come as consumers in China remain hesitant about spending because of the country's economic challenges.\n\nThe offer covers Apple's top models as well as older handsets and some other devices. The biggest discount of 500 yuan will apply to Apple's flagship iPhone 16 Pro, which has a starting price of 7,999 yuan, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max which currently costs 9,999 yuan. The firm held a similar promotion in China last year ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This year, the festival starts at the end of January.\n\nChanging behaviour\n\n\"Apple's strategy has changed to adapt to the change in Chinese consumers' shopping behaviour,\" said Will Wong, a senior research manager for market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC). \"The value-seeking trend has made price discounts more attractive to consumers. Apple may fall behind other competitors if it doesn't adopt such a pricing strategy.\" The discounts being offered by Apple and Huawei reflect a wider trend in China. From online retail giants to the country's car makers, deals are being offered in a bid to attract customers who have been reluctant to spend as the world's second largest economy slows. The Chinese government has also stepped up efforts to boost consumption. Last year, Beijing launched a trade-in programme to encourage consumers to replace old products such as cars and household appliances. The plan was expanded on Friday to include mobile phones, tablets, smartwatches and fitness bands.\n\nLocal competition",

    "body": "Why does Britain face flight chaos during bad weather?\n\n4 January 2025 Share Save Faarea Masud BBC Business reporter Share Save\n\nPA Media Bad weather can cause travel disruption for passengers, as seen at the end of 2024 in the UK (file photo from 2017)\n\nPassengers at British airports have faced travel chaos on multiple occasions over the last few weeks, from heavy winds to fog. Now, the Met Office has issued an amber warning for snow and ice in the Midlands, north of England and Wales, which says that delays and cancellations to air travel are \"expected\". It can seem a mystery to many frustrated flyers that a brief spell of bad weather can upend schedules, especially since British weather isn't exactly famed for being the best. So why, with all the technological advancements of planes and airports in recent years, do flights get affected so badly?\n\nHow efficiency can quickly turn to chaos\n\nWhile planes are designed to deal with the likes of snow and ice, fog and high winds, air traffic control often imposes strict safety limits in these situations. As a result, \"airports go into a kind of slow motion\" with the spacing between arriving and departing aircraft increased, says travel expert Simon Calder. If the conditions \"require air-traffic controllers to increase the spacing between aircraft by 50%, capacity is immediately reduced by one third \u2013 and cancellations begin,\" he adds. There's little slack in the system, as when things are running smoothly, schedules at London Heathrow - Europe's busiest airport - are based on landing aircraft as close as 80 seconds apart. And London Gatwick, the UK's second busiest airport, can facilitate a take-off or landing every 65 seconds. The spacing between arriving and departing aircraft was increased at London Gatwick last weekend during the fog, which Mr Calder estimates led to about 75,000 passengers being affected. Among them were James and Madison King, whose flight from Stockholm to London took a lengthy diversion because of the fog-related spacing limits. They were within touching distance of home when the pilot announced they did not have enough fuel for a 50-minute holding pattern at Gatwick, so the plane diverted to Dublin to refuel. Flight crew shift limits then meant all the passengers had to fly back to where they started in the Swedish capital. James says he still hasn't been reimbursed for the \u00a3200 he spent on a hotel and dinner during this impromptu additional overnight stay in Stockholm.\n\nJames King/ Madison King James and Madison King were delayed over Christmas\n\nHeathrow also saw delays and cancellations during high winds before Christmas. Despite some airports trialling artificial intelligence to help planes land in low visibility, controllers in on-the-ground towers still need to clearly see an aircraft arriving before issuing a landing clearance, aviation expert Scott Bateman MBE wrote on X. He says the majority of modern aircraft can automatically land in the worst fog, but that in practice visibility limits are imposed so pilots can see sufficiently to taxi off the runway. Elif Arjin Celik's flight from London Gatwick to Istanbul was delayed for hours because of poor visibility in the fog on 28 December 2024. She saw thousands of people waiting in the terminal with nowhere to sit, and says it was \"grim\" having to wait 20 minutes to use the toilet because of the \"extreme overcrowding\". With upcoming warnings of snow, Mr Calder advises passengers to brace for more disruption to their flights because of spacing limits and runway closures. \"The UK has seen some shocking snow closures, where big airports have simply not been able to cope,\" he says, citing an incident in 2010 where hundreds of thousands of passengers saw cancellations at Heathrow because of snow. Snow also caused Manchester Airport to close both its runways in December 2022 and again in January 2023, with flights diverted as far away as Dublin and Paris. Although the extreme cost of disruption on this scale has led to British airports investing more in hardware and training to clear snow quicker, don't expect us to cope like airports in places such as Iceland and Greenland. Mr Calder says we might never be as good as other countries at keeping an efficient schedule in unusual weather. \"Historically the UK has had a benign climate,\" he says. \"Spending millions preparing for an unlikely event has been hard to justify.\"\n\nDisruption could grow\n\nThere's not great news on the horizon because in the future, we can expect more disruption from weather related to climate change, says Dr Ella Gilbert, a climate expert from the British Antarctic Survey. \"Aviation tends to be most impacted by extreme precipitation and stormy weather that makes flying unsafe - two weather types that are enhanced by higher temperatures,\" she says. She adds that climate heating increases the frequency and intensity of rain and snowfall events, making storms \"stronger and more frequent\" and increasing the frequency of aircraft turbulence. Nats, the national air traffic service, is allowed to take action to reduce the amount of planes in the sky and space them apart more during adverse weather under the Transport Act 2000. Given this is part of Nats' obligation to prioritise safety over all other factors, it doesn't have to compensate airlines for these restrictions - which in turn means airlines don't need to compensate passengers for the resulting delays either. The organisation told the BBC that it recognises there's a tough balancing act. \"Flow regulations are only ever employed when absolutely necessary and have to be expertly timed,\" a Nats spokesperson said. \"Unexpected additional or delayed air traffic can increase the pressure on controllers, particularly when the weather clears. \"If restrictions are lifted too early, they can risk an overpopulated airspace, while on the flip side, restrictions remaining in place longer than they need to can lead to unnecessary delays, which no one wants.\" This is brought into sharp focus during storms, Nats explained. \"Fundamentally, pilots don't want to fly through storms,\" it told the BBC. \"Although aircraft are robust, storms can still affect aircraft systems and excessive winds within unstable storm clouds make it much more difficult for aircraft to maintain their levels. It also increases turbulence, which negatively impacts passenger comfort.\" This leads to planes being in unexpected parts of the sky at different times, and all these new routes needing to be recalibrated to avoid any collisions. Nats says it does have measures to mitigate disruption, including specialist Met Office weather equipment which can help foresee the need for safety limits to be imposed, while pilots also have more tech on board to help them fly around bad weather patches and inform air traffic controllers of potential issues.\n\nWhat are your rights if a flight is cancelled due to poor weather?",

    "title": "The 20 child abuse inquiry recommendations",
    "body": "The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?\n\n9 January 2025 Share Save Tom Symonds Political correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn October 2022, child protection expert Prof Alexis Jay finished a seven-year inquiry into the countless ways children had been sexually abused in England and Wales. She had presided over hundreds of days of evidence in which victims described their treatment and those who had the duty to protect them answered for their failings. Her team had investigated abuse in churches, schools, custodial institutions, political parties, religious groups, and children's homes. She found that over decades, children had been harmed online, offline, in the UK and abroad, by individuals and paedophile networks, including grooming gangs, on the streets of British towns and cities. Her conclusion: the nation had been scarred by an \"epidemic that left thousands of victims in its poisonous wake\". The abuse was often covered up by institutions that \"prioritised their reputations above the welfare of those they were duty bound to protect\". Her inquiry was not a court. No one will go to prison because of her findings, but she had the power to make recommendations for change and to monitor whether they happened. There were 20 in the final report of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA). The Conservative government was given the task of delivering them but lost last year's general election. Now, 27 months on from the recommendations first being made, all remain outstanding. The new Labour government says it is \"working at pace\" to deliver them.\n\nMandatory reporting\n\nThe biggest single reform Prof Jay recommended was for people in regulated jobs working with children to have the duty to report any abuse they witnessed or were told about by either the child or perpetrator. Not doing so would be a criminal offence, as would covering up abuse. The Conservative government agreed but, to the dismay of campaigners, decided the sanction would be less severe - a ban on working with children. A criminal offence would be committed only by those who actively prevented the authorities finding out about abuse. This policy was slated to go to Parliament in 2024, but the election was called before it could become law. The Labour government has resurrected the issue, with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper telling the Commons on Monday 6 January she would introduce criminal sanctions for both the cover-up of child sexual abuse and the failure to report it. The government says mandatory reporting will be part of the Crime and Policing Bill planned for this Spring.\n\nPA Media Prof Alexis Jay\n\nProduce better data\n\nThe inquiry recommended a major effort to produce better data on child abuse, creating a single core set of figures covering the age, sex and ethnicity of victims and perpetrators, the places in which abuse happens, and the factors that make children vulnerable. The Conservatives set up research projects in several government departments to improve the data. Suella Braverman, then home secretary, created what she described as a \"grooming gangs taskforce\". The police disliked the grooming gangs description and rebadged it as the child sexual exploitation taskforce as it would also fight groups of abusers in institutions, families and online. It provides intelligence and expertise to police forces through a variety of programmes, and has begun to gather consistent data. However, statistics on the ethnicity of abusers, a key issue in the grooming gangs debate, are hard to obtain. Prof Jay's inquiry found police were \"not confident\" about gathering this information. A suspect's race can be identified definitively only after they have been arrested, by asking them at a time when they have a right to remain silent. Latest figures show there is a long way to go. In 2023, police tackling organised abuse recorded the ethnicity of 34% of suspects and 47% of victims. Cooper says she is working to \"improve the accuracy and robustness of the data and analysis\".\n\nNo new child protection authority\n\nProf Jay recommended the appointment of a new cabinet minister for children. Several junior ministers are responsible for aspects of young people's lives, and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson attends cabinet, but there is no cabinet minister with the title envisaged by the inquiry. A bigger change involves the recommendation for a child protection authority for England and Wales. The Conservatives preferred instead to make existing institutions work better. The new government wants what has been described as a \"fuller conversation\" on a new authority. Setting one up would involve several government departments. Lucy Duckworth, from campaign group Act On IICSA, says it should operate like the Health and Safety Executive, providing training and support in protecting children. The recommendation for a national public awareness campaign remains outstanding, though the government already funds a series of campaigns. Prof Jay wanted it to extend to content on TV and digital channels but also to use \"positive role models\" in creative media such as drama. They include better registration of staff in children's homes, as well as young offender institutions and secure training centres. She demanded more use of the vetting and barring list of approved employees, that the government took steps to improve compliance with it, and its extension to those working with children overseas. These measures were \"in progress\" according to a Conservative government update in 2023. A related recommendation is to ban staff in institutions from using pain to get children to comply. The last government would not give a clear commitment to this, saying in 2023 there might be a need for it to prevent serious physical harm to a child or adult. Ms Duckworth says banning the use of pain restraint is essential, saying it amounts to \"legalising a form of child abuse\", and points out some perpetrators might deliberately seek out jobs where they can hurt children. The last government was concerned about the implications of the proposal to change the Children's Act to give courts powers over local councils when children are at risk. This has not happened.\n\nOnline safety\n\nDuring the seven years Prof Jay's inquiry was investigating, abuse online was growing steadily. She recommended platform providers pre-screen for known child sexual abuse material. The Conservatives passed the Online Safety Act. Ofcom now requires some internet companies to remove harmful images using databases that contain profiles for known child abuse pictures. The act toughens the law on age verification online, another inquiry recommendation. Ofcom is due to publish new guidance for pornography sites. The inquiry's demand covered a wider group of \"online services and social media platforms\". In response, Ofcom said it will be expecting \"much greater use of age-assurance\" systems in future. There were a range of recommendations for the courts, police and prosecutors. Prof Jay wanted an end to the three-year limit for victims of abuse to sue for damages, as it often takes them longer to feel able to disclose what has happened. The Conservatives launched a consultation but it ended shortly before the election.\n\nCompensation for victims\n\nThe inquiry's call for a single redress scheme for victims of institutional abuse to apply for a payment to reflect their experiences remains outstanding. It could cost billions, with central and local government footing the bill. Changes to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme were recommended to expand the range of compensation to cover the mental health effects of abuse. Work is ongoing. The proposal for a national guarantee of specialist therapy for child victims will be challenging for the government to respond to. The Jay Inquiry demanded it be \"fully funded\", with councils delivering the service. Yet child mental health facilities are under pressure and local authorities are already struggling to deliver social care services. Another big issue in historical cases has been access to records relating to child abuse held by authorities. The job of ensuring this is possible has been given to the Information Commissioner's Office. An investigation of whether the criminal justice system was complying with the Victim's Code is being carried out. However, the inquiry first called for it in 2018. The government has made consulting victims and survivors of abuse a priority. It has announced a panel to work with ministers on the delivery of the recommendations.\n\nSlow progress",

for change and to monitor whether they happened there were 20 in the final report of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse iicsa the conservative government was given the task of delivering them but lost last years general election now 27 months on from the recommendations first being made all remain outstanding the new labour government says it is working at pace to deliver them mandatory reporting the biggest single reform prof jay recommended was for people in regulated jobs working with children to have the duty to report any abuse they witnessed or were told about by either the child or perpetrator not doing so would be a criminal offence as would covering up abuse the conservative government agreed but to the dismay of campaigners decided the sanction would be less severe a ban on working with children a criminal offence would be committed only by those who actively prevented the authorities finding out about abuse this policy was slated to go to parliament in 2024 but the election was called before it could become law the labour government has resurrected the issue with home secretary yvette cooper telling the commons on monday 6 january she would introduce criminal sanctions for both the coverup of child sexual abuse and the failure to report it the government says mandatory reporting will be part of the crime and policing bill planned for this spring pa media prof alexis jay produce better data the inquiry recommended a major effort to produce better data on child abuse creating a single core set of figures covering the age sex and ethnicity of victims and perpetrators the places in which abuse happens and the factors that make children vulnerable the conservatives set up research projects in several government departments to improve the data suella braverman then home secretary created what she described as a grooming gangs taskforce the police disliked the grooming gangs description and rebadged it as the child sexual exploitation taskforce as it would also fight groups of abusers in institutions families and online it provides intelligence and expertise to police forces through a variety of programmes and has begun to gather consistent data however statistics on the ethnicity of abusers a key issue in the grooming gangs debate are hard to obtain prof jays inquiry found police were not confident about gathering this information a suspects race can be identified definitively only after they have been arrested by asking them at a time when they have a right to remain silent latest figures show there is a long way to go in 2023 police tackling organised abuse recorded the ethnicity of 34 of suspects and 47 of victims cooper says she is working to improve the accuracy and robustness of the data and analysis no new child protection authority prof jay recommended the appointment of a new cabinet minister for children several junior ministers are responsible for aspects of young peoples lives and education secretary bridget phillipson attends cabinet but there is no cabinet minister with the title envisaged by the inquiry a bigger change involves the recommendation for a child protection authority for england and wales the conservatives preferred instead to make existing institutions work better the new government wants what has been described as a fuller conversation on a new authority setting one up would involve several government departments lucy duckworth from campaign group act on iicsa says it should operate like the health and safety executive providing training and support in protecting children the recommendation for a national public awareness campaign remains outstanding though the government already funds a series of campaigns prof jay wanted it to extend to content on tv and digital channels but also to use positive role models in creative media such as drama they include better registration of staff in childrens homes as well as young offender institutions and secure training centres she demanded more use of the vetting and barring list of approved employees that the government took steps to improve compliance with it and its extension to those working with children overseas these measures were in progress according to a conservative government update in 2023 a related recommendation is to ban staff in institutions from using pain to get children to comply the last government would not give a clear commitment to this saying in 2023 there might be a need for it to prevent serious physical harm to a child or adult ms duckworth says banning the use of pain restraint is essential saying it amounts to legalising a form of child abuse and points out some perpetrators might deliberately seek out jobs where they can hurt children the last government was concerned about the implications of the proposal to change the childrens act to give courts powers over local councils when children are at risk this has not happened online safety during the seven years prof jays inquiry was investigating abuse online was growing steadily she recommended platform providers prescreen for known child sexual abuse material the conservatives passed the online safety act ofcom now requires some internet companies to remove harmful images using databases that contain profiles for known child abuse pictures the act toughens the law on age verification online another inquiry recommendation ofcom is due to publish new guidance for pornography sites the inquirys demand covered a wider group of online services and social media platforms in response ofcom said it will be expecting much greater use of ageassurance systems in future there were a range of recommendations for the courts police and prosecutors prof jay wanted an end to the threeyear limit for victims of abuse to sue for damages as it often takes them longer to feel able to disclose what has happened the conservatives launched a consultation but it ended shortly before the election compensation for victims the inquirys call for a single redress scheme for victims of institutional abuse to apply for a payment to reflect their experiences remains outstanding it could cost billions with central and local government footing the bill changes to the criminal injuries compensation scheme were recommended to expand the range of compensation to cover the mental health effects of abuse work is ongoing the proposal for a national guarantee of specialist therapy for child victims will be challenging for the government to respond to the jay inquiry demanded it be fully funded with councils delivering the service yet child mental health facilities are under pressure and local authorities are already struggling to deliver social care services another big issue in historical cases has been access to records relating to child abuse held by authorities the job of ensuring this is possible has been given to the information commissioners office an investigation of whether the criminal justice system was complying with the victims code is being carried out however the inquiry first called for it in 2018 the government has made consulting victims and survivors of abuse a priority it has announced a panel to work with ministers on the delivery of the recommendations slow progress",

    "body": "Gallagher accuses GAA president of sabotage over Naas intervention\n\n9 January 2025 Share Save Share Save\n\nGetty Images Rory Gallagher, pictured here in March 2023, resigned as Derry GAA's senior football manager in May of the same year\n\nRory Gallagher has accused the GAA president Jarlath Burns of trying to sabotage his career after he intervened in his potential appointment at Naas GAA. In a statement to BBC News NI, Mr Gallagher said Mr Burns' actions were \"unprecedented\" and \"misguided\" and threatened legal action if the remarks were not retracted. The former Derry county football manager was offered a coaching role with Naas but the offer was then withdrawn after details of the appointment were made public at the weekend. It later emerged Mr Burns had contacted the club to express his concern at the proposed appointment.\n\nMr Gallagher stepped down as Derry manager in 2023 just weeks before the team played in the Ulster Senior Football Final. It followed allegations of abuse made by his estranged wife Nicola Gallagher, which he denied. When news of the appointment at Naas appeared in the media, the association's president spoke to the Naas club chairman before sending an email which was then read at a meeting of party officers at which it was decided not to proceed with Mr Gallagher's appointment. In the email, which has been seen by the BBC, Mr Burns said he felt compelled to share his perspective given the \"potential implications for Naas GAA and the wider association\". He said decisions made by the club \"reverberate far beyond your immediate community\" and send a \"message about the values we uphold and the standards we set for our members and supporters\". He also warned of the implications for the GAA's Game Changer Initiative which was launched in November to challenge the \"social and cultural norms that contribute to domestic, sexual and gender based violence\".\n\nMr Burns said employing Mr Gallagher could attract negative attention and criticism for the club\n\nClaims made by estranged wife\n\nAfter Mr Gallagher resigned as Derry manager, he was \"temporarily debarred\" by the GAA in September 2023 when an independent panel was asked to investigate the claims made by his estranged wife. Mr Gallagher successfully challenged that debarment in February 2024 and a statement from his solicitors in September said there was no \"legal impediment\" to prevent him returning to a senior role in the game. \"I have engaged with every procedure available to me. The PPS have issued two separate decisions finding that I have no case to answer,\" Mr Gallagher added in his statement to the BBC. \"Despite having engaged with due process and procedure, it seems clear that the president has now opted to take matters into his own hands. \"It seems that social media commentary and controversy now equates to a license for presidential intervention.\"\n\nIn the email to Naas GAA, Mr Burns said the \"appointment of Rory Gallagher given the allegations that have been made public, risks undermining the principles of the Game Changer Initiative and the positive work being done across the GAA\". He added: \"The controversy surrounding his personal life has created significant division and concern within the wider GAA community. \"Such a decision by Naas GAA could have far reaching consequences.\" Mr Burns added the appointment would likely \"polarise opinion\" and create unnecessary tension within the club and he questioned the \"confusing message\" it would send to younger members. In conclusion the GAA president said he had \"no authority to dictate club decisions\" but he had a \"responsibility to advocate\" for what he believed was in the best interests of the association and its members. \"By choosing not to proceed with this appointment you will be making a statement about the principles that define Naas GAA,\" he added.\n\nLegal action threatened\n\nMr Gallagher has called on the GAA president to withdraw his remarks. \"I have never asked for sympathy or support. I do however ask that this action is formally withdrawn and the contents of the correspondence is retracted,\" he said. \"The president should lead by example and accept when he has overstepped the mark. \"Absent such a retraction, I will have no other alternative but to take legal action to cure the irreparable damage done to me and my family in my ability to continue to work as a manger in the years ahead. When approached the GAA said it acknowledged the receipt of queries from media organisations in \"relation to coaching positions with the Naas senior football team\", but that it had no comment to make at this time.",

    "body": "Australian sect members guilty of causing girl's death\n\n29 January 2025 Share Save Hannah Ritchie BBC News, Sydney Share Save\n\nJayde Struhs Elizabeth Struhs (right) pictured with her sister, Jayde, who testified against the defendants at trial\n\nFourteen members of an Australian religious group have been convicted of killing an eight-year-old diabetic girl who was denied insulin for almost a week. Elizabeth Struhs died at home in 2022 from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes. The court heard that Elizabeth's treatment was withheld because the group, known as the Saints, opposed medical care, believing God would heal her. Her father Jason Struhs and the group's leader Brendan Stevens were on trial for murder but convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Twelve other members, including Elizabeth's mother and brother, were also convicted of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty.\n\nWhen handing down his almost 500-page verdict on Wednesday, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and \"every member of the church including all other accused\" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death. \"It cannot be doubted that Elizabeth was lovingly cared for in almost every way,\" he said. \"However, due to a singular belief in the healing power of God\u2026 she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive.\" The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and have roughly two dozen members from three families. The judge-alone trial in the Supreme Court of Queensland began in July last year and lasted several months. Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an \"intelligent\" child who suffered greatly in her final days. \"She was described as speaking little, needing help going to the toilet, and being incontinent,\" prosecutor Caroline Marco said, adding that the girl would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness. The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for Elizabeth, whose health deteriorated as she lay on a mattress at her home in Toowoomba, about 125km (78 miles) west of Brisbane.\n\nABC News: Sharon Gordon Prosecutors said the defendants shunned the use of medicine and instead trusted God to \"heal\" Elizabeth\n\nNo effort was made to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, as the group believed she could be brought back to life, the court heard. The 14 defendants, aged between 22 and 67, represented themselves at trial, having all refused legal representation or to enter pleas. The court was required to enter not guilty pleas on their behalf. Most had been charged because they had either counselled or aided her father in his decision to withhold Elizabeth's insulin, the court heard. Prosecutors said that Jason Struhs, 53, had converted to the church much later than his wife Kerrie Struhs, 49, and that he had previously supported giving Elizabeth medicine. They argued he changed his mind after being baptised into the group and that ultimately he knew the decision would end his daughter's life. Speaking through tears when it was his turn to take the stand at trial, Jason Struhs said that he and Elizabeth had agreed to \"stop the insulin\" together, and that he still believed his daughter would be resurrected. \"Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again,\" he told the court. Stevens, 63, defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of \"religious persecution\". He said that the group was within its \"rights to believe in the word of God completely\" and that their decision not to enter pleas was because the congregation had \"no intention of fighting\" the case by using law.\n\nElizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs told the trial she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them. She and other witnesses described the congregation as having increasingly strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were \"pagan\" or ungodly festivals.\n\nABC News: Sharon Gordon Elizabeth's father Jason Struhs said he believed Elizabeth would be \"resurrected\" after her death\n\nThe court also heard that Elizabeth's life had been in danger in 2019 when she was admitted to hospital in a diabetic coma weighing just 15kg (2st 5lb), after having become too weak to walk. She was then diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections. Both parents were charged over that incident - however Jason Struhs testified against his wife and received a more lenient sentence. At the time, he said his wife - who had been a member of the Saints for years - did not believe in providing their kids with medical treatment for religious reasons. He also openly expressed regret for having \"let his daughter down\". The court heard he later helped provide her with insulin for a period while his wife was in jail, but that he then faced pressure from other members of the religious group to stop doing so. Giving his verdict, Justice Burns said that Jason Struhs and Stevens couldn't be convicted of murder because prosecutors had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the pair had intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to Elizabeth. But all 14 defendants were guilty of manslaughter, he ruled, because they were jointly involved in a crime that resulted in her death. Jayde Struhs said that while she was pleased with the verdict, the \"system had failed\" her sister. \"We are only here today because more wasn't done sooner to protect her or remove her from an incredibly unsafe situation in her own home,\" she said in a statement outside court. The group is expected to be sentenced next month.",

    "body": "Hugh Grant urges police to investigate Sun owners\n\n24 January 2025 Share Save Maia Davies BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nHugh Grant has called for police to open a new criminal investigation into the owners of The Sun, saying the job is not done \"by any means\" after Prince Harry settled his privacy claim on Wednesday. News Group Newspapers (NGN) agreed to pay \"substantial damages\" and apologised to the Duke of Sussex for \"serious intrusion\" by The Sun between 1996 and 2011, and admitted \"incidents of unlawful activity\" were carried out by private investigators working for the newspaper. Grant also settled a privacy claim against NGN in 2024, saying he could have faced a bill of up to \u00a310m even if he had won. The actor said both incidents had shown a civil case was \"not the right instrument\" to get to \"the real truth\" of what happened at the newspaper.\n\nFormer deputy Labour leader Lord Tom Watson, who also reached a settlement with NGN on Wednesday, said a legal team would be passing a dossier to the Metropolitan Police. The force said on Friday there were no active investigations into allegations of phone hacking or related matters. \"We await any correspondence from the parties involved, which we will respond to in due course,\" a spokesperson said. Grant said NGN had \"gamed\" the civil courts to silence complainants and a criminal investigation was needed. \"That's what they've done consistently over the last 10 years,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday. \"They've spent \u00a31bn to make sure these things are never looked at in court\u2026 and you don't get proper judicial findings. \"I think what they're terrified of is that those findings would trigger a new criminal inquiry.\" In the civil courts, claimants could end up paying the costs of their opponents if the damages award is less than they have been offered to settle - even if they win. Grant had accused The Sun of using private investigators to tap his phone and burgle his house, and said he settled because he could not face the possible costs of proceeding to trial. NGN had denied the allegations and said the settlement was reached \"without admission of liability\". The actor called on the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Metropolitan Police to investigate. The CPS told the BBC criminal investigations were matters for the police.\n\nReuters Prince Harry pictured outside the High Court, in a separate court case against the Daily Mirror publisher in June 2023",

People's homes have also been affected by flooding, including those living in Wolston, Warwickshire.\n\nResident Sh\u00e2n Dobinson said she was stranded upstairs in her house in the village due to the flooding downstairs. \"It's now thigh-deep where our cars were,\" she told BBC CWR. \"We can't get in or out, we're totally stranded.

The University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, which runs County Hospital, Stafford, and the Royal Stoke University Hospital, said its staff and patients had been affected. Dr Mark Poulson, deputy chief medical officer, told BBC Radio Stoke: \"We had to support staff getting into hospital by using 4x4s - sending them out to help bring them in.\" He said they had done what they could to make the hospitals safe for patients, including making sure the sites were clear of snow. \"It's been a difficult morning, but services have continued as normal,\" he added.\n\nThe snow caused problems on the roads in Staffordshire, including in Endon\n\nThe weather conditions led to 45 schools being closed in Staffordshire, with several in south Cheshire also forced to shut. Four schools in Telford also delayed opening until later on Monday, and The Bridge School was fully closed for the day, according to the council. The railways were also affected by the flooding, including the line between Birmingham Snow Hill and Stratford-upon-Avon. Replacement buses were operating between Shirley and Stratford-upon-Avon, according to West Midlands Rail. Lines were closed between Hereford and Worcester Shrub Hill stations due to heavy rainfall but have since reopened. A number of roads in the region were forced to close too, with Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire the worst affected.\n\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "title": "Trump tells Putin to end 'ridiculous war' in Ukraine or face new sanctions",
    "body": "Trump tells Putin to end 'ridiculous war' in Ukraine or face new sanctions\n\nResponding to the threat of harsher sanctions, the Kremlin said it remains \"ready for an equal dialogue, a mutually respectful dialogue\".\n\nTrump had previously said he would negotiate a settlement to Russia's full-scale invasion launched in February 2022, in a single day.\n\nWriting on his social media platform Truth Social, he said that by pushing to settle the war he was doing Russia and its president a \"very big favour\".\n\nDonald Trump has warned he will impose high tariffs and further sanctions on Russia if Vladimir Putin fails to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"We're waiting for signals that are yet to arrive,\" said President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov.\n\nHe added that Russia sees nothing new in Donald Trump's threats to impose sanctions.\n\n\"He likes these methods, at least he liked them during his first presidency.\"\n\nPutin has said repeatedly that he is prepared to negotiate an end to the war, which first began in 2014, but that Ukraine would have to accept the reality of Russian territorial gains, which are currently about 20% of its land. He also refuses to accept Ukraine joining Nato, the military alliance of Western countries.\n\nKyiv does not want to give up its territory, although President Volodymyr Zelensky has conceded he may have to cede some currently occupied land temporarily.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump told a news conference he would be talking to Putin \"very soon\" and it \"sounds likely\" that he would apply more sanctions if the Russian leader did not come to the table.\n\nBut in his Truth Social post the next day, he went further: \"I'm going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOR,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War! IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. If we don't make a 'deal', and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries.\"\n\nContinuing, he wrote: \"Let's get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with! We can do it the easy way, or the hard way - and the easy way is always better. It's time to 'MAKE A DEAL'.\"\n\nTrump's former special representative for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, said Trump's threat of more serious sanctions on Russia \"gives a signal to Vladimir Putin this is going to get worse, not better\". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: \"We should incentivise Putin to say, 'OK, it's time actually to have a ceasefire.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the World Economic Forum on Tuesday that at least 200,000 peacekeepers would be needed under any agreement.\n\nAnd he told Bloomberg that any peacekeeping force for his country would have to include US troops to pose a realistic deterrent to Russia.\n\n\"It can't be without the United States...

    "body": "Cher Lloyd on making new music, Swagger Jagger and Liam Payne's unmatched talent\n\n17 January 2025 Share Save Eleanor Shearwood BBC Newsbeat Share Save\n\nMila Austin Still got that swagger: Cher Lloyd's releasing new music for the first time since 2020\n\nThe world first met Cher Lloyd in 2010 when, aged 16 - she walked on to the X Factor stage and blew the audience away with her version of Keri Hilson's Turn My Swag On. It ended up being a fourth-place finish in the TV talent show for Cher, who signed with Simon Cowell's record label, releasing number one single Swagger Jagger and two studio albums. Since that early success she's been in and out of the spotlight, and stunned fans at the start of this year when she announced an upcoming single - her first since 2020. Speaking to BBC Newsbeat 15 years later, Cher says music's still \"everything\" to her and she's \"spilling the tea\" on her new track Head Down. \"I was on such a huge reality TV show and the experience that I had was just a rollercoaster of emotions,\" she says. \"I just felt like I needed to get a lot of stuff off my chest. \"Head Down for me was a way to do that without blurting it all out and getting in trouble.\"\n\nGetty Images Cher was the focus of many tabloid stories during her stint on X Factor\n\nLooking back, Cher says her time on the X Factor was a \"shock to the system\". \"I had this illusion that the show was just going to be about singing and performing and I didn't realise that 80 or 90% of it was reality TV.\" Cher got a tough time from the tabloid press during her time on the show - with stories about \"diva\" behaviour turning some of the audience against the teenager. She says it makes her \"really sad\" feeling that she gained a reputation as the series villain. \"That was never my intention,\" she says. \"I feel like it kind of overshadowed the reason why I was there and that was because I love to sing\". When asked how she coped with the negative attention, Cher says she didn't. \"That's why you saw me spiral and make bad decisions,\" she says. One person who helped her through, though, was Liam Payne. The One Direction star died last year in a fall from a hotel balcony. \"He was always the level-headed one,\" says Cher. \"He looked after everyone and he had this nurturing energy. And the passion that he had for performing was just unmatched. \"I don't think I've spoken about it like this before, but the talent he had was just unbelievable\".\n\nGetty Images Cher appeared on the X Factor alongside One Direction\n\nCher's now a mum, and says knowing there's more to life than performing is the \"thing that keeps her sane\". \"The biggest most important thing is to be a decent person and to treat people well\". That's brought new challenges for her, and she wants to see working parents in the music industry \"cut a bit more slack\". Cher says she's still \"expected to do it all\". \"It's just this that vicious circle and I'm still trying to get my head around it and understand it,\" she says. Having children's just one way her career has shifted. Cher's musical style has also changed, but there's one track that she can't escape. Swagger Jagger. She says she didn't perform her debut single for years, seeing as \"the old me\". \"As an artist, I've moved on from that,\" she says. But the internet hasn't.\n\nSwagger Jagger 'part of my story'\n\nCher's music got a huge boost thanks to a viral video of two young girls recording a music video in their bedroom. It starts with one saying: \"I'm gonna sing Cher Lloyd by Cher Lloyd\". They launch into one of Cher's songs, titled Oath, but are interrupted when a mum bursts into the room, angrily asking: \"Why does somebody not know how to flush a toilet?\". Needless to say, Cher thinks it's \"hilarious\". \"Every time I see it I'm just in stitches,\" she says. \"And the fact that my name is attached to it. It's just gold. \"I'd love nothing more than to recreate that video\u2026 how funny would that be?!\" When Cher performed Swagger Jagger at a festival last year, she says seeing the crowd go mad changed her own feelings towards it. \"The feeling I got from it was just like\u2026 how can I not perform this?\" \"I know I'm not there artistically anymore with Swagger Jagger, but it's such a huge part of my story\u2026 I just have to do it.\" Being Bradford - The secret behind Bad Boy Chiller Crew\n\nWhy global stars like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran are hitting India\n\nThe artists tipped to top your playlists in 2025 But Cher is keen to show there's more to her than one track, and says her new music is ready to go. \"I'm just gonna keep rolling the songs out,\" she says. And Cher says that being back making music makes her feel \"worth it again\". \"I know that sounds really dark,\" she says. \"But when you've been in a bad place, when you have that thing that makes you feel good again, you've just got to hold on to it.\"",

    "body": "'War will last as long as Russia does': Ukrainian talk of victory fades as Trump returns\n\n17 January 2025 Share Save Orla Guerin Senior International Correspondent Reporting from Kyiv and Dnipro Share Save\n\nBBC/Xavier Vanpevenaege Anastasiia's husband, Andriy, will never get the chance to meet his baby daughter\n\nAnastasiia Fedchenko, 36, wails in anguish \u2013 her agony echoing around the gilded walls of St Michael's Cathedral in Kyiv. She sits with her hands resting on both sides of her stomach. She is heavily pregnant with her first child, a baby girl. Her husband Andriy Kusmenko is just inches away, in uniform - in an open coffin. The marine commander was killed in action in eastern Ukraine on 4 January this year. He is now and forever 33. While Andriy fought in the war, Anastasiia wrote about it, as a journalist. His brothers in arms file past, dropping red roses into his coffin. As funeral prayers come to an end, Anastasiia leans forward and gives \"the love of her life\" one last kiss.\n\nBBC/Xavier Vanpevenaege Andriy was killed in action on the front line at the start of the year\n\nOutside the cathedral she pays tribute to her \"most handsome husband\" who died for his country. \"I am sorry my daughter will never see her father,\" she tells the BBC, \"but she will know that he was a soldier, an officer, and that he did everything he could for Ukraine to exist for her and for other generations.\" \"This war will last as long as Russia does. I truly fear our children will inherit it from us and will have to go and fight.\" Not according to Donald Trump, who famously claimed he could end the war in a day, and who returns to the White House next week. He is already pushing for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. That would dishonour the dead, according to Sgt Dmytro, call sign \"Smile\", who fought alongside Andriy and came to the cathedral to mourn him. \"Let the people in power decide, but I don't think the ones who fell would want them [Ukraine's leadership] to sit around the table,\" he says. \"After the funeral, we are heading back to work. We will fight for every Ukrainian who fell.\" Plenty here believe \u2013 like Anastasiia and Dmytro - that far too many Ukrainians have been killed to try to do a deal with Russia. But public opinion is shifting, and others believe there is too much death and destruction not to do a deal.\n\nBBC/Xavier Vanpevenaege Andriy Kusmenko's fellow soldiers came to the cathedral to honour him\n\nAs Ukraine battles through its third winter of war, one word is now little spoken here \u2013 \"victory\". In the early days of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, we heard it everywhere. It was a rallying cry for a nation suddenly confronted by columns of enemy tanks. But the past is truly a foreign country \u2013 and one with more territory. Moscow now controls almost one-fifth of its neighbour (including the Crimean Peninsula, captured in 2014) and says any peace talks must take that into account. The Ukraine of 2025 is a place of cold, hard realities \u2013 where cities empty, graveyards fill, and plenty of soldiers desert their posts.\n\nBBC/Goktay Koraltan Up to 100,000 cases have been opened against soldiers, such as Serhiy Hnezdilov, who have deserted their units\n\nSix hours drive from the capital, in the heart of Ukraine, a young soldier is in the dock. Serhiy Hnezdilov, a burly 24-year-old, is locked in a glass cubicle in a packed courtroom in the city of Dnipro. He is on trial on charges of desertion, and is one of many. Since 2022, around 100,000 cases have been opened against soldiers who left their units, according to data from Ukraine's General Prosecutor's office. When Hnezdilov went absent without leave, he went public with demands for a clear time frame for ending military service. He says he is ready to fight but not without a plan for demobilisation. He has already served for five years, including two before Russia's full-scale invasion. \"We must continue to fight,\" he told me during a break in the hearing, \"we have no other choice.\" \"But soldiers are not slaves. Everyone who has spent three years or more on the front line deserves the right to rest. The authorities have been promising for a very long time to set terms of service, but they have not done it.\" In court he also complained of corruption among commanders, and of deadly incompetence. After the brief procedural hearing, he was handcuffed for the journey back to prison. If convicted he faces up to 12 years in jail. \"Help Ukraine,\" he told us, as he was led away.\n\nBBC/Goktay Koraltan \"I am tired... time off is rare,\" says Mykhailo, a drone unit commander\n\nMany other Ukrainian soldiers are still straining every sinew on the front lines, trying to at least slow the Russian advance. Mykhailo, 42, the chain-smoking commander of a drone unit, does battle every night fuelled by \"Non-Stop\" - a Ukrainian energy drink. He is with the 68th \"Jaeger\" Brigade, fighting to hold on to the eastern front-line city of Pokrovsk \u2013 a key transportation hub. The Russians are closing in on two sides. Mykhailo drives us to a Ukrainian position \u2013 a journey we can only risk after dark, and in an armoured car. The Russians too have eyes in the skies. Their drones are a constant threat. He is watchful, and weary. \"I went to the enlistment office in the first days,\" he tells us, \"and I hoped everything would go quickly. Honestly, I am tired. Time off is rare [in his case a total of 40 days in three years]. The only thing that saves me is that I can video chat with my family.\"\n\nBBC/Goktay Koraltan Mykhailo and his fellow soldiers at a pop-up drone position, trying to slow the Russian advance on the eastern city of Pokrovsk\n\nWe arrive at a disused house where Mykhailo and his men unload their equipment and set up a pop-up drone position. Screens are carried in, and cables connected. Outside, troops erect an antenna taller than a two-story building. They work fast under torchlight \u2013 using red beams not white as these are harder to detect. Then they assemble bombs to arm their \"vampire\" \u2013 a supersized attack drone. For the next few hours, we have front-row seats as Mykhailo - call sign \"Admin\" \u2013 pilots the drone, his eyes darting from screen to screen. First, he drops supplies to front-line Ukrainian troops and then drops an anti-tank mine on Russian forces underground. It falls slightly wide of its target. He is up against high winds and Russian jamming. All the while he is on the look-out for incoming enemy drones.\n\nBBC/Goktay Koraltan Ukrainian troops send supersized attack drones into combat in the skies as the Russians inch forward\n\nMykhailo detects a Russian warplane in the skies. Minutes later we hear the distinct thud of three Russian glide bombs. \"It's far,\" he tells us. That turns out to mean two to three kilometres away. During a lull, I ask Mykhailo if he thinks a peace deal is possible. \"Maybe not,\" he says. \"This [Putin] is a completely unstable person, and that's putting it very gently.\" \"I hope that at some stage the enemy will stop because they tire out, or someone with a sound mind comes to power.\" He won't comment on President Trump. While Mykhailo is a veteran of this war, one of his men is a beginner. Twenty-four-year-old David joined up last September as the Russians neared his hometown. He now spends his time handling explosives \u2013 though he would prefer to be at college learning languages.\n\nBBC/Goktay Koraltan Mykhailo's unit works under torchlight \u2013 using red beams not white as these are harder to detect\n\n\"No-one knows how long the war will last,\" he says, \"maybe not even the politicians\". \"I would like it to end soon so that civilians won't suffer, and people won't die anymore. But considering how things are now on the front line, it won't be soon.\" He believes that if the guns are silenced, it will be only a pause, before Moscow comes back for more. The winds get stronger and the vampire drone crash-lands. It's out of action for now. The unit pack up and leave, as fast as they came. They will be back in action at nightfall, resuming the duels in the sky. But on the ground the Russians keep inching forward, and the Trump presidency will mean pressure for a deal. And there is one more hard truth here: if it comes it is unlikely to be on Ukraine's terms.",

    "body": "Up to Greenland to decide its future, Danish PM tells Trump\n\nShe also reiterated the statements of the Greenland PM, Mute Egede, who recently said that Greenland was not for sale.\n\nIn a 45-minute phone call on Wednesday, Frederiksen told Trump that Denmark was prepared to increase its responsibility for security in the Arctic.\n\nThe US president-elect sparked turmoil in Copenhagen and Nuuk, Greenland's capital, last week when he signalled that the US wanted to acquire the huge arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\nDenmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has told Donald Trump that it is up to Greenland to decide its own future.\n\nTrump did not react to the call publicly. However, he reposted on his TruthSocial account a 2019 poll that indicated 68% of Greenlanders supported independence from Denmark.\n\nA referendum on independence is thought to be on the cards and Denmark has said it would respect any result.\n\nWhen he was last president, Trump said he wanted to buy Greenland. When Frederiksen called the proposal \"absurd\", he abruptly cancelled a trip to Denmark.\n\nThe Danish government said that in her phone call with Trump, Frederiksen also emphasised that \"Danish companies contribute to growth and jobs in the US, and that the EU and the US have a common interest in strengthened trade.\"\n\nLast week, Trump threatened Denmark with high tariffs if the country did not give up Greenland.\n\nThe suggestion set off alarm bells among Danish industry leaders, as the US is Denmark's second largest export market and any targeted tariffs would have a significant impact on the Danish economy.\n\nOn Thursday, Frederiksen will hold what Danish media dubbed a \"crisis meeting\" with business leaders, including the CEOs of beer giant Carlsberg and drugmaker Novo Nordisk, which produces obesity and diabetes drugs popular in the US.\n\nShe is also due to host an extraordinary Foreign Policy Council meeting with members from across parliament.\n\nGreenlandic member of parliament Aaja Chemnitz said she was satisfied with Frederiksen's line that any decision about Greenland should be taken by Greenlanders.\n\n\"I have great confidence in the prime minister's task, and I also have great confidence in Egede. I think it is important that they have a close dialogue,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this week, Egede said his government was ready to start a dialogue with the incoming Trump administration.\n\nBut opposition MP Rasmus Jarlov said that he disapproved of Frederiksen's approach.\n\nWriting on X, he said: \"It is completely unacceptable that [Frederiksen] renounces Denmark's rights in Greenland and places sovereignty solely with the [Greenlander] self-government when she talks to the President of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's comments and his son's visit to Greenland last week sparked huge concern in Denmark. Faced with the prospect of angering what she repeatedly called \"Denmark's closest ally\", Frederiksen measured her words while emphasising Greenland's right to self-determination.\n\nHans Redder, TV2's political editor, said the fact that Trump had set aside 45 minutes for a phone call with Frederiksen indicated that \"this Greenland thing is really something that is on Trump's mind - it's not just a passing thought\".",

    "body": "At a glance: What was in Rachel Reeves's speech?\n\n30 January 2025 Share Save Sam Francis Political reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nRachel Reeves has set out a series of major announcements on infrastructure projects, including backing plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport. She promised to go \"further and faster\" than previous governments after years of sluggish growth in the UK. However, many of the projects still need to go through a formal planning process so it could be years before building starts and the economy sees any benefit. How quickly could the plans boost growth?\n\nHow will the UK's growth plans affect me?\n\nHeathrow expansion\n\nReeves confirmed the government is backing plans to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport, arguing it could create 100,000 jobs. The plans received parliamentary approval in June 2018, but have been stuck in limbo after legal challenges ever since. She invited Heathrow to submit plans to expand the airport by the end of the summer, but promised the government would only sign them off if they were \"in line with legal environmental and climate objectives\". The government has already backed the expansion of City Airport and Stansted Airport around London. A decision to expand Luton Airport and build an emergency runway at Gatwick Airport will be delivered soon, she promised. The government will work with local authorities to reopen the Doncaster Sheffield Airport, aiming to turn it into a thriving regional hub. There will also be a new partnership between Prologis and Manchester Airport Group will build a new advanced manufacturing and logistics park, resulting in \u00a31bn of investment and 2,000 jobs, Reeves said. Reeves later said a third runway could be built by 2035, however others believe it will be closer to 2050.\n\n'Silicon Valley'\n\nReeves vowed to build \"Europe's Silicon Valley\" between Oxford and Cambridge, with policies aimed at boosting the region's growth, saying they would add \u00a378bn to the UK economy in the next 10 years. Funding has been confirmed for transport projects, including new services on an East-West Rail line beginning this year - reviving plans shelved by Boris Johnson in 2022. She also promised an upgrade on the A428 between Milton Keynes and Cambridge. The University of Cambridge will open an innovation hub in the city centre, which will be built alongside 4,500 new homes and schools, after the Environment Agency dropped its opposition. Approvals for new towns are expected soon as the government has already received proposals along the rail with 18 submissions for sizeable new developments. A new Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital will also be prioritised. Lord Patrick Vallance, the ex-chief scientific adviser to the government and now a Labour minister, will be in charge of overseeing the project. Governments of all stripes have been looking at creating large-scale housing projects in the so-called Oxford-Cambridge Arc since at least 2003. Various projects gained support under Johnson, Theresa May and Rishi Sunak - but were killed off by funding concerns and local opposition. The original plans had promised the new rail line would be completed by 2030 and one million new homes and jobs delivered in the area by 2050. What do government plans mean for Cambridge?\n\nNew reservoirs\n\nThe government has approved \u00a37.9bn in investment for water companies to build nine new reservoirs, including a new Fens Reservoir to serve Cambridge. There will also be a new Abingdon Reservoir near Oxford. Officials agreed water resources management plans with water firms in December, with the first reservoirs due to open in 2028, and 2050 as the completion date for all projects.\n\nChanging infrastructure rules\n\nGovernment guidance on building major projects will be reviewed in order to support investments outside of the wealthy and productive south-east of England, Reeves said. \"This means that investment in all regions is given a fair hearing by the Treasury that I lead,\" she said. This will work alongside other major changes set out in the government's upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill. PM vows to curb 'Nimby' legal blocks on infrastructure\n\nRedevelopment of Old Trafford\n\nOne of the projects to benefit is plans to redevelop Manchester United's Old Trafford football stadium. Manchester United are set to make a decision by the end of the season on whether to redevelop the existing stadium into an 87,000-capacity venue or build a brand-new 100,000-capacity ground. The club said it would make the final decision by the summer. The Old Trafford scheme is expected to use public money to move three rail freight terminals blocking the redevelopment. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has promised the scheme will build 5,000 homes and create a second \"major football campus\" in the city. New Man Utd stadium could bring \u00a37bn boost report finds\n\nTrade trips\n\nReeves announced the government will be hosting a range of trade trips. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is going to India next month for trade talk while the UK resets \"the relationship\" with the EU. Building on \"our special relationship with the United States under President Trump\" is in the national interest, Reeves said. Can opposites Trump and Starmer find common ground?\n\nSecret UK 'mini cabinet' tries to plan for unpredictable Trump\n\nNational Wealth Fund investments\n\nThe government will invest in two green energy projects through the National Wealth Fund set up under Labour. Reeves said \u00a365m will be given to electric vehicle charging company Connected Kerb project to extend their network. Meanwhile \u00a328m will be invested in Cornish Metals, which provide the raw material for solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles. The funding is expected to be released shortly. Government fund pledges \u00a330m to reopen tin mine\n\nLower Thames Crossing\n\nReeves mentioned the new Lower Thames Crossing, the UK's largest road tunnel, which will link Tilbury in Essex and Gravesend in Kent. The \u00a39bn tunnel under the Thames river will be one of the most expensive infrastructure projects in British history. The government is exploring how to finance it privately. Private sector could finance crossing, says chancellor\n\nAround the UK",

    "body": "Central Cee makes history at Mobo Awards\n\n18 February 2025 Share Save Riyah Collins BBC Newsbeat Share Save\n\nGetty Images Central Cee is the first artist to win best male act at the Mobos three times\n\nCentral Cee has made history at the Mobo Awards, becoming the first artist to be named best male act three times. It was his seventh trophy, matching Stormzy's record as the most decorated rapper in the awards' history. He did not attend the ceremony in person, with his prize instead collected by host Eddie Kadi who joked they \"share everything... except royalties\". The event in Newcastle also saw Bashy claim best album and best hip-hop act after a 15-year break from music and Darkoo beat off competition from Raye and Jorja Smith to be recognised as best female act.\n\nAccepting her award, Darkoo said she \"tried Chat GPT\" to write her speech \"but I didn't know how to make it work\", so instead freestyled and thanked her family for supporting her. \"It's been a rollercoaster but they believed in me for the past year and I've been shutting it down.\"\n\nPA Media Darkoo also performed at the event, treating the audience to the song of the year - Favourite Girl\n\nCentral Cee, also known as Cench, was previously named best male act in 2024 and released his debut album last month after eight top 10 singles. Reacting to his win on Instagram, he posted a screenshot of the awards' coverage with the comment \"that's nice\". He missed out on his other two nominations including best drill act, which went to Pozer, and song of the year which was won by Darkoo alongside her trophy for best female act. Despite not making breaking into the UK singles charts, the British-Nigerian artist won for Favourite Girl, a collab with Dess Dior, ahead of Stormzy's number one track with Chase & Status, Backbone, as well as Central Cee's collab with Lil Baby, Band4Band, which peaked at number three.\n\nGetty Images Ayra Starr made history as the first African woman to win best international act\n\nAyra Starr also scooped two awards, making history as the first African woman to win best international act and becoming the first woman to win best African music act in 16 years. Jamaican dancehall artist Vybz Kartel was also recognised with the Mobo impact award. He was released from jail last year after his murder conviction was overturned and at the weekend was confirmed to be performing at this summer's Wireless festival. \"Think about this, got locked up, did 13 years in prison,\" he said while accepting his accolade. \"Meanwhile I'm diagnosed with Graves' disease so I'm fighting to be free, I'm fighting my illness, I'm fighting to keep my family together, I'm fighting to keep the fans pleased. \"And now I'm here, I walked the red carpet at the Mobo's. That taught me to believe in three things now more than ever: fate, change and forgiveness.\"\n\nGetty Images Vybz Kartel attended the awards where he was honoured with the Mobo impact award\n\nThe ceremony saw performances from Nova Twins, Spice, Krept And Konan and award winners Odeal, Darkoo and Bashy. Bashy, who returned to music after a 15-year break to focus on his acting career, won best hip-hop act as well as album of the year for Being Poor Is Expensive - an award he said he \"wanted and deserved\". \"This has been a 20-year plus journey, it's been hard work, tenacity, a lot of ups and downs. \"I stood in my truth, stood in my community's truth and now I'm here,\" he said on stage, making a point to thank the Windrush generation. \"I'm just a regular guy from the ends. I was a bus driver, I was a postman, I worked in retail. So if you're out there and you're working a job to fund your passion, don't be ashamed of your job. \"This is an amazing honour, I'm humbled.\"\n\nGetty Images Bashy, real name Ashley Thomas, won two awards on his comeback to music after a 15-year break\n\nIt was the first awards since Mobos founder Kanya King revealed she'd been diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer. Labour MP Dawn Butler became emotional as she announced Kanya would receive a surprise award, paving the way, which was also won by athlete and broadcaster Denise Lewis.

    "body": "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages\n\n7 February 2025 Share Save Zoe Kleinman \u2022 @zsk Technology editor Brian Wheeler Senior political reporter Share Save\n\nReuters Keir Starmer is pinning his growth hopes on cutting edge tools powered by AI\n\nSir Keir Starmer's plan to make the UK a \"world leader\" in Artificial Intelligence (AI) could put already stretched supplies of drinking water under strain, industry sources have told the BBC. The giant data centres needed to power AI can require large quantities of water to prevent them from overheating. The tech industry says it is developing more efficient cooling systems that use less water. But the department for science, innovation and technology said in a statement it recognised the plants \"face sustainability challenges\". The government has committed to the construction of multiple data centres around the country in an effort to kick start economic growth.\n\nMinisters insist the notoriously power-hungry server farms will be given priority access to the electricity grid. Questions have been raised about the impact this might have on the government's plans for clean energy production by 2030. But less attention has been given to the impact data centres could have on the supply of fresh, drinkable water to homes and businesses. Parts of the UK, in the south especially, are already under threat of water shortages because of climate change and population growth. The government is backing plans for nine new reservoirs to ease the risk of rationing and hosepipe bans during droughts. But some of these are in areas where new data centres are set to be built. The first of the government's \"AI growth zones\" will be in Culham, Oxfordshire, at the UK Atomic Energy Authority's campus \u2013 seven miles from the site of a planned new reservoir at Abingdon. The 4.5 sq mile (7 sq km) reservoir will supply customers in the Thames Valley, London and Hampshire. It is not known how much water the massive new data centres now planned nearby could take from it. The BBC understands Thames Water has been talking to the government about the challenge of water demand in relation to data centres and how it can be mitigated. In a new report, the Royal Academy of Engineering calls on the government to ensure tech companies accurately report how much energy and water their data centres are using. It also calls for environmental sustainability requirements for all data centres, including reducing the use of drinking water, moving to zero use for cooling. Without such action, warns one of the report's authors, Prof Tom Rodden, \"we face a real risk that our development, deployment and use of AI could do irreparable damage to the environment\".\n\nGetty Images Data centres - like this Google facility in Hertfordshire - are being built across the country\n\nThe tech industry tends to be cagey about water consumption. Most UK data centres contacted for this article did not respond to our inquiries. Data centres use fresh, mains water, rather than surface water, so that the pipes, pumps and heat exchangers used to cool racks of servers do not get clogged up with contaminants. The amount used can vary considerably depending on a number of factors including the surrounding environment; sites in colder, wetter parts of the world tend to require less. Dr Venkatesh Uddameri, a Texas-based expert in water resources management, says a typical data centre can use between 11 million and 19 million litres of water per day, roughly the same as a town of 30,000 to 50,000 people. His widely quoted calculations are based on arid, or semi arid, climates and do not take into account recent efficiency improvements or developments in AI. Microsoft's global water use soared by 34% while it was developing its initial AI tools, and a data centre cluster in Iowa used 6% of the district's water supply in one month during the training of OpenAI's GPT-4. Local resistance to data centres is growing around the world, particularly in areas where water is scarce. In Chile, Google stopped building a data centre following concerns about its water use, and it redesigned the cooling system at another in Uruguay following local protests.\n\nGetty Images Racks of computer servers can generate a lot of heat\n\nIn the UK, Thames Water has warned data centres they could face restrictions on use during heatwaves. In 2022, the company said it would review data centres' water use as it prepared to introduce a hosepipe ban during a summer draught. But Foxglove, a group of campaigning lawyers, found evidence from Thames Water's strategy documents the following year that the firm still did not appear to know how much water its existing data centre customers were using. Thames Water declined to comment. It signposted its recent five-year plan, which has been approved by the government. This states that it has no legal obligation to service businesses, and can choose to restrict or refuse water to commercial customers; but this was written before the government designated data centres as Critical National Infrastructure, meaning they will face fewer planning restrictions. Thames Water filed an objection to a planning application for a new data centre in a cluster in Slough, near Reading, in 2021. But other proposals in the area have since succeeded: for example in August 2024 the firm Yondr announced that it would be building its third data centre campus there. Foxglove CEO Martha Dark said: \"The government must urgently explain how its plans for new data centres will not threaten our long-term supplies of drinking water.\"\n\nGetty Images The site of a planned new Meta data centre in Spain has raised concerns",

    "body": "Sweden mourns after deadliest shooting as gunman details emerge\n\n5 February 2025 Share Save Joel Gunter BBC News in Orebro, Sweden Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nSwedish police said they were still investigating the motive behind the country's deadliest mass shooting, as local media began reporting details about the gunman. The suspect, named in reports as 35-year-old local man Rickard Andersson, was reported to be a former student of the school in Orebo, a city 157 km (98 miles) west of Stockholm, where the attack took place on Tuesday. Eleven people died in the shooting, including the attacker, with at least six others injured. The attack has sent shockwaves through the nation, with King Carl XVI Gustaf on Wednesday saying: \"All of Sweden is mourning.\"\n\nAuthorities are still yet to release details about the dead and injured. Health officials said three women and two men were in a critical but stable condition, while another woman was treated for minor injuries. Police declined to confirm media reports naming Andersson as the suspect. Orebro police said they had identified the suspect but would \"not publish his name yet, due to the investigation\". They have not said how he died but indicated on Wednesday he had most likely killed himself after an exchange of fire with police. Police said they were still investigating why the gunman had chosen to attack the Risbergska adult educational centre. Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported the suspect was previously enrolled at the school but had not attended classes since 2021. Police on Tuesday said the suspect had no apparent links to gangs and did not appear to be motivated by ideology. They also do not believe the attack was motivated by terrorism. \"We will get back on what motives there are,\" local police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters on Wednesday. The suspect had no previous convictions and obtained his weapon legally, local media reported. Sweden's public broadcaster SVT suggested it was a hunting weapon, while Swedish Radio said police had listed the weapon as an automatic firearm.\n\nSVT Rickard Andersson, 35, was named by Swedish media as the suspect\n\nLocal police chief Mr Forest also defended authorities' delay in releasing accurate information about the number of dead and wounded. He said the size of the school premises had led to delays in ensuring there were not more victims. Police said they were using fingerprints, dental records and DNA to identify victims - alongside interviews with family members. In addition to providing Swedish language classes for immigrants, the Risbergska centre also provided adult education for people aged over 20 who did not finish primary or secondary school.\n\nEarlier, Orebro residents attended a candlelit vigil outside the educational centre, which remains cordoned off. Flags around Orebro and at government buildings, parliament and royal palaces across the country were also lowered to half-mast. King Carl XVI Gustaf, who visited the campus on Wednesday with Queen Silvia, told reporters: \"All of Sweden feels it has experienced this traumatic event.\" \"All Swedes are thinking of those people who lost their loved ones,\" the King told the BBC. He said he was \"sure the country would overcome the tragedy... one way or another, but it will take time\".\n\nEPA Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf told the BBC: \"All Swedes are thinking of those people who lost their loved ones\"",

    "title": "Peak District: 'I learned the hard way about parking near Mam Tor beauty spot'",
    "body": "'Nightmare visit to beauty spot made me infamous on Tiktok'\n\n23 February 2025 Share Save Chris Waring BBC News, East Midlands Share Save\n\nBBC Chelsea Coltart's TikTok video about the incident has been viewed more than 2.4 million times\n\nA woman who drove to the Peak District for a hike - only to return to her car to find it damaged and with a parking ticket - is warning others to learn from her mistakes. Chelsea Coltart, 28, was visiting Mam Tor on 18 January to catch a glimpse of the sunrise, after seeing videos of the beauty spot on social media. After completing a circular route, the marketing manager discovered the fine, along with the damaged car that had been parked in a no stopping zone. \"Following other cars on the day was probably my biggest regret and I'll never do that again,\" she added.\n\nChelsea found a parking fine on her windscreen and damage to the front of her car\n\nRoads in the national park have recently been blighted by parking issues, including on 11 January when \"around 200 cars\" prevented gritting from taking place. On Friday, calls were made to bring together MPs, councils and emergency services in order to tackle the problem. Chelsea, from Milton Keynes, said she initially did not notice any clear signage when trying to find a space. \"I don't think there is enough guidance on where to park but... we've all passed our test and we should know the signs,\" she added. Chelsea believes her car was damaged by a large vehicle trying to pass. \"They must have hit me from the front because the wheel was actually protruding. I got a quote for repairs and it was \u00a32,000,\" she said. Chelsea filmed the moment she found her damaged vehicle and posted the video to her TikTok channel.\n\nA no stopping (clearway) sign near to where Chelsea parked can be seen in a video she filmed and shared\n\n\"I was looking for a space from 07:30 - just going back and forth doing U-turns - and then parked where all the other cars were at 07:53 and then I got back at 12:30,\" she said. \"You couldn't park anywhere. Every car was up the side of the road. There were cars everywhere. It was awful to be honest.\" According to the Highway Code, a clearway sign means no stopping. While she admitted accidentally parking next to such a sign, Chelsea believes there is not enough parking provision at the beauty spot and accepts the \"frustration\" locals must feel. \"I think if places are becoming more popular, which, again is a Catch-22, they need more infrastructure in place such as car parks or more signage,\" she said. \"You don't want to build car parks and damage the natural environment, so it is such a hard balance.\"\n\nCars were parked on both sides of Winnats Pass, near Mam Tor, in the early hours of 18 January\n\nSince Chelsea's \u00a370 fine and original TikTok video - which has been viewed more than 2.4 million times and attracted more than 1,500 comments - she started to point people in the direction of nearby free parking in the national park. Those posts prompted a response from Derbyshire Police's TikTok account, which asked Chelsea to report the incident and said the points she raised were \"brilliant\". Chelsea reported the incident to police, which later said it could not investigate without further information. Addressing some of the negative comments she received on the social media platform, Chelsea said: \"I know emergency vehicles were able to get through, it's just bad parking. \"You go to a new place and get stick because it's your first time but you've got to start somewhere with everything. \"Everyone has their own struggles in life, you don't know what someone's going through. \"Social media, either way, you're always going to get hate. I do marketing for a living, I know what it's like. You've just got to do damage control.\"\n\nVehicles can be seen passing Chelsea's car in the video she shared on social media\n\nA spokesperson for the Peak District National Park Authority said: \"Dangerous or disruptive parking can affect not only those going about their business in the local area, but also restrict emergency services access or highways maintenance. \"Over 80 car parking locations comprising thousands of spaces are listed on the national park authority website including sat-nav postcodes and other navigation information such as What3Words.\" A spokesperson for Derbyshire County Council added: \"We continue to have our parking wardens out in those very popular areas which can experience parking issues, such as Mam Tor, seven days a week. \"Blocking roads causes issues for the emergency services, buses, bin lorries, gritting lorries and mountain rescue and we would appeal, yet again, for people to park considerately and in accordance with the highway code.\" Derbyshire Police said it was continuing to work with local councils and partners to devise a long-term solution to the ongoing parking issues in the area. A spokesperson said: \"Most people do manage to park safely, but we have seen dangerous and irresponsible parking from some people in recent weeks, bringing roads to a standstill and hindering emergency services. \"If the parking spaces are full, parking your car dangerously is not an option.\" Reflecting on her experience, Chelsea said she would do \"a lot more research and be more considerate of the people that are living in the area\". \"You know, if you don't plan, you plan to fail,\" she added.\n\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "title": "Audiologists raise concern over headphone use in young people",
    "body": "Are noise-cancelling headphones to blame for young people's hearing problems?\n\n16 February 2025 Share Save Hannah Karpel BBC News, health reporter Share Save\n\nBBC Sophie says her anxiety peaks if she is in a loud environment and not wearing her headphones to limit the noise\n\nWhether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day. But, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts. This is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\". \"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said. After a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words. Her audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones.\n\n'Words sound like gibberish'\n\nHaving grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from. She rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. \"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said. It affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".\n\nGetty Images Classrooms can echo sound and be full of noises like clicking pens, typing and whispering which make listening to a teacher difficult for people with auditory processing disorder\n\nThe cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play. Other audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use. Five NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling. APD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\n\nHearing vs listening\n\nRenee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on. Her team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\" Noise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music. Lisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model. \"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.\n\nA false reality?\n\nBut Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise. \"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said. \"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests. For those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited. A UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD. And, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long. Prof Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\" Particularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown.\n\nGetty Images Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children have seen an increase in demand for assessments of children struggling to hear certain words in noisy environments\n\nIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on. Dr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children. \"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\" Dr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research. He said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".\n\nTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery. So-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three. Microphones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS. \"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis. \"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\" To improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.\n\nLimited research",

street hospital supported the call for more research he said there had been a significant increase in demand for assessments at the hospitals large apd clinic for under16s especially with difficulties noticed at school treatment for apd can make a significant positive difference with some patients able to make a full recovery socalled word in noise training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise but training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen and free and three microphones and lowgain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations such as a meeting or classroom work but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the nhs right now i can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something i need to worry about says dr alexander describing what is called auditory scene analysis its the way we identify threats in our environment so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a persons brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not to improve this dr alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that dont completely occlude or block the ears limited research",
    "summary": "Are noise-cancelling headphones to blame for young people's hearing problems?\nHer audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones.\nHowever, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\nHer team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year.\nDr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children.",

    "body": "'Everyone must go': New Zealand's tourism drive draws ire\n\nThe New Zealand government has been forced to defend the new campaign aimed at enticing Australian tourists over\n\nThe government has defended the campaign, with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon saying he \"[appreciates] there's lots of chat about whether everyone loves the slogan or not\".\n\nBut what was meant as a catchy call to action aimed at Australian tourists has been accused of being tone-deaf, as New Zealand deals with record emigration rates and unemployment.\n\n\"Everyone Must Go!\" reads a slogan printed across posters of people in New Zealand's majestic landscapes - part of a NZ$500,000 ($285,000; \u00a3227,000) campaign unveiled on Sunday.\n\nDepending on how you read it, New Zealand's latest tourism tagline can be a well-meaning plea for people to visit - or a threat to kick Kiwis out.\n\nSome view New Zealand's new tourism campaign as insensitive to the issues facing citizens\n\n\"The fact that we're talking about it is a good thing. It's a great thing,\" he added.\n\nCushla Tangaere-Manuel, tourism spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, told local news outlet Radio New Zealand (RNZ) that the new slogan \"makes New Zealand sound like we're in a clearance bin at a sale\".\n\n\"The irony of that messaging is, that's how Aotearoa New Zealanders are feeling right now,\" she said, pointing to the \"many cuts\" that residents have experienced.\n\nJob cuts to the public sector over the past year, as part of the government's austerity push, have affected thousands of people.\n\nMeanwhile, people are moving out of the country in record numbers. Official figures show that there were nearly 130,000 departures last year - though that was offset by the arrival of nearly 160,000 immigrants.\n\n\"New Zealanders are voting with their feet, leaving in record high numbers,\" Labour MP Barbara Edmonds wrote on X on Monday. \"Is their real tourism plan 'Everyone Must Go' - for Kiwis?\"\n\nOthers associated the slogan with demand for lavatories.\n\n\"I think 'Everyone Must Go' might refer to the need for toilets in some of our high-tourist spots. I mean, the queues are ridiculous,\" Green Party MP Celia Wade-Brown told RNZ.\n\n\"They don't go kayaking, they don't go diving, but, my goodness, they queue at the toilets.\"\n\nTourism minister Louise Upston said in a statement on Sunday that \"the campaign tagline of 'Everyone must go' lets Australia know that New Zealand is a 'must visit' destination, and that we're ready and waiting to welcome them now\".\n\nNew Zealand's tourism numbers have yet to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, and authorities are channelling efforts into attracting visitors from neighbouring Australia, its largest source of tourists.\n\nLast year, New Zealand welcomed more than 1.2 million visitors from Australia. But Upston said visitors numbers were only 88% of that in 2019.\n\nLuxon said he hoped the latest campaign would boost Australian visitor numbers by 5%.\n\n\"It would be totally and utterly tragic if those Australians don't get here before they do die,\" he said.\n\nThe month-long tourism campaign is set to start on Thursday.",

    "body": "US military plane carrying deported Indians lands in Punjab\n\n5 February 2025 Share Save Soutik Biswas and Samira Hussain BBC News, Delhi and Amritsar Share Save\n\nGetty Images The US military plane in Amritsar, where authorities say they have put in place measures to process deportees\n\nA US deportation flight carrying about 100 Indian nationals accused of entering the country illegally has landed in the state of Punjab. The military aircraft, which left Texas late on Tuesday, is now in the city of Amritsar where authorities say they have put measures in place to process the deportees. President Donald Trump has made the mass deportation of undocumented foreign nationals a key policy. The US is said to have identified about 18,000 Indian nationals it believes entered illegally. Trump has said India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him that the country would \"do what's right\" in accepting US deportations.\n\nAuthorities in Punjab say they have set up special counters to receive the deportees, adding the individuals would be treated in a \"friendly\" manner. Journalists have gathered outside police barricades near an Indian Air Force building in Amritsar. There are 104 Indian deportees on the flight and they will be processed separately from regular passengers before boarding buses to their home states, including Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Trump is increasingly using US military planes to return individuals to their home countries. However, deportation flights to India are not new. In the US fiscal year 2024, which ended in September, more than 1,000 Indian nationals had been repatriated by charter and commercial flights. In October, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported more than 100 Indian nationals who lacked legal grounds to stay in the US on a chartered flight, part of a rising trend in removals to India. That flight carrying adult men and women was also routed to Punjab, close to many deportees' places of origin. No precise breakdown of hometowns was provided. Much of the migration from India to US appears to originate from the Sikh-dominated state of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana, which has traditionally seen people migrating overseas. The other source of origin is Gujarat, Modi's home state. \"That has been part of a steady increase in removals from the US of Indian nationals over the past few years, which corresponds with a general increase in encounters that we have seen with Indian nationals in the last few years as well,\" Royce Bernstein Murray, assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security told a media briefing in October. Encounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country's borders with Mexico or Canada. A total of 5,477 Indians have been deported from the US by ICE between 2018 and 2023, according to official figures. More than 2,300 were deported in 2020, the highest in recent years.\n\nGetty Images Migrants from India share water in the intense heat after walking into the US from Mexico last year",

    "title": "US-UK trade deal: Would an agreement change anything?",
    "body": "Faisal Islam: Any Starmer deal with Trump is all about avoiding tariffs\n\n28 February 2025 Share Save Faisal Islam \u2022 @faisalislam Economics editor Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions. It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position. Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more. There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president, \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU. So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards. But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era. It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU. It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table. In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.\n\nThe narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\". Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here. This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes. The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces. While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit. The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago. Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues. This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.\n\nGetty Images",

According to a court filing, the man who was 17 at the time, paid a bouncer to enter the club and was invited to Combs' private table, where he was given multiple shots of vodka. The plaintiff claims that after consuming the drinks, he \"began to become hazy and disoriented\" and felt himself \"losing consciousness and control of his body\". Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in a number of civil lawsuits, and has previously labelled them \"sickening\". The BBC has sought response from his team on the new allegations.\n\nReferred to in court documents as John Doe, the plaintiff alleges he was led to a back room at the SoHo club where people were using drugs and engaging with escorts. He said he realised the drinks he was given were spiked and \"impacting his faculties\". In his statement, the plaintiff says he came in and out of consciousness and while he was aware of what was happening, he could not stop it. The statement alleges the \"defenceless\" plaintiff was raped by Combs in the back room of the nightclub. In a statement to the BBC in response to separate federal criminal charges, Combs' lawyer said: \"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"",

He had a valid residence and work permit.\n\nHe had no previous criminal record, and police said there was no evidence of a link to a jihadist group. He also appears to have acted alone, German authorities say.\n\nOn Friday, police said the suspect told officers during questioning that he had driven his Mini Cooper car intentionally into the crowd.\n\nMunich public prosecutor Gabriele Tilmann told reporters that the suspect had said \"Allahu Akbar\" - God is greatest in Arabic - when he was detained. She suggested he \"may have had an Islamist motivation\".\n\nCampaigning around Germany's election on 23 February has for weeks been embroiled in a fevered debate about migration.

Daisy the Labrador was abducted from her Norfolk garden in November 2017, sparking press appeals and a petition to government. An RSPCA inspector found 13-year-old Daisy more than 200 miles away in Somerset on Sunday during a routine investigation, and checked her microchip. Owner Rita Potter spoke of her joy at getting her dog back, adding: \"We kept a photograph on the mantlepiece and would look at it every day thinking of her, and where she might be.\"\n\nRSPCA Rita and Philip Potter never gave up hope of finding their dog Daisy\n\nMrs Potter and her husband Philip struggled to hold back tears as Daisy returned to her home in Old Buckenham. \"It is an absolute dream come true that the RSPCA found her and returned her to us - where she belongs - we are so, so grateful,\" said Mrs Potter.\n\nRSPCA RSPCA inspector Kim Walters (left), pictured with colleague Andy Cook, was able to bring the dog back to Norfolk\n\nDaisy's theft made news headlines in 2017 after witnesses spotted her being bundled into a truck by suspected 'backyard breeders', who make profit out of breeding animals and have little care for their welfare. Police investigated but the vehicle could not be traced. Mr and Mrs Potter took part in several press and social media appeals, with support from actor Tom Hardy who shared their post. They also started a petition urging the government to do more to tackle pet theft, which attracted 100,000 signatures. Last year the Pet Abduction Bill was passed.\n\nRSPCA The Potter family have been delighted to have Daisy back\n\nRSPCA inspector Kim Walters rushed Daisy to a vet in Weston-Super-Mare on Sunday, after becoming concerned about her condition. Her owner - who claimed he had only had the dog for a few years - agreed to sign her over into the care of the animal welfare charity. A microchip scan revealed she was stolen and gave contact details for Mr and Mrs Potter. Ms Walters said: \"They were obviously shocked - but elated at the same time. \"I was a bit choked from listening to them, and clearly how much they loved her, so it was great telling them that we could get her back home soon.\" Andy Cook, behavioural welfare adviser for the charity, said: \"It seems Daisy has been used for 'backyard breeding' and she has a number of mammary masses, she has slight hip dysplasia and her coat was quite dirty. \"She really is the sweetest girl and will wag her tail whenever she sees you, but since she was stolen it is clear she has had a hard life.\" Mrs Potter said: \"We know she is elderly now and has health issues, but whatever time she has left she will now be surrounded by lots of love and attention.\"\n\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "body": "YouTuber's 'dirty' comments spark massive row in India\n\n19 February 2025 Share Save Cherylann Mollan BBC News, Mumbai Share Save\n\nBeerBiceps/YouTube Ranveer Allahbadia, also known as BeerBiceps, is a popular Indian podcaster\n\n\"Dirty.\" \"Perverted mind.\" \"Disgusting.\" These were the words India's Supreme Court used on Tuesday while granting interim protection from arrest to a popular YouTuber who has been in the eye of a storm in the country over the past week. The furore began after Ranveer Allahbadia - whose YouTube channel BeerBiceps has eight million followers - asked a contestant the question: \"Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\" The comments, made on the show India's Got Latent on 9 February, sparked massive outrage, police cases and even death threats. YouTube quickly removed the episode, but that didn't stall the tide of anger directed at Allahbadia and the show. In fact, the amount of attention the incident has received is mind-boggling: it has made national headlines, been covered on primetime TV and some of India's most prominent news sites have even run live pages. Not surprising, considering the star status of Allahbadia. He has interviewed federal ministers, top Bollywood celebrities, cricketers and Hollywood actors. And last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed him a \"National Creators Awards\" trophy. Since the controversy erupted, Allahbadia and the show's creator, Samay Raina, have apologised for the comments and Raina has taken down all previous episodes of the show. The Supreme Court in its recent order has even banned Allahbadia from posting content on social media. But the incident continues to make news. \"It feels like the state is trying to make an example out of Allahbadia,\" says Apar Gupta, founder of the Internet Freedom Foundation. Saket Gokhale, an opposition lawmaker, also condemned the targeting of Allahbadia and the show. \"Crass content can be criticised if it offends you. However, you cannot have the state persecute and lock up people for offending your 'moral sentiments',\" he wrote in a post on X. Popular comedian Vir Das also weighed in on the controversy and criticised news channels for their one-dimensional coverage of the incident and for taking a disparaging view of all digital content. Allahbadia's remarks and the subsequent backlash have triggered debates around free speech and India's obscenity laws; it has also sparked conversations around the thirst for viral content and the consequences its makers face when their content crosses lines upheld by the very people who watch it.\n\nGetty Images The latest controversy has triggered debates around free speech and India's obscenity law\n\nRaina's show, which debuted in June, has been popular from the start, with each episode being viewed tens of millions of times on YouTube. And it hasn't shied away from kickstarting controversies either. The show has platformed some bizarre performances and judges and contestants have been seen making crass and crude comments more than a few times. Critics have accused the show of spewing misogynistic views and for body-shaming guests. A popular fashion influencer once walked out of the show after a male contestant compared her to a former adult film actress while another asked her about her \"body count\" (a slang term for the number of sexual partners a person has had). But that seems to have been the appeal of the show too. Fans of the show have hailed it for championing \"raw talent and unfiltered jokes\". Some have said that they liked the roasts - a form of insult comedy - which was popular on the show. Experts have underscored how, with the entertainment landscape exploding, digital content creators often feel compelled to push the envelope - even if it means resorting to the risqu\u00e9 and lewd - just to gain views and virality. It's safe to say the show pushed the envelope and the buttons of many. But then, it backfired.\n\nSamay Raina/YouTube Samay Raina is a popular stand-up comedian in India",

    "body": "US measles outbreak leaves nearly 100 ill in Texas and New Mexico\n\nMeasles is highly contagious and can be deadly. The outbreaks come amid a rise in US anti-vaccine sentiment, including towards the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab that is typically given during childhood.\n\nIn New Mexico, officials said nine people had become sick in Lea County, along the state's eastern border with Texas.\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services reported on Friday that it was aware of 90 cases diagnosed in the last month in the South Plains area, in the north-west part of the state. At least 77 of them were reported in children and teens under 17.\n\nHealth officials in two US states are tracking measles outbreaks as cases rise to nearly 100 people.\n\nHealth officials in Texas say their figures are likely to be an underestimate, as some parents may not report infections or may not realise their child has the disease.\n\n\"It is troubling, because this was completely preventable,\" Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner.\n\n\"It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans,\" he added.\n\nSymptoms of the highly-infectious illness include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a rash.\n\nA measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death.\n\nSurvivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).\n\nMost US children receive two shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nHealth experts say that the disease could be controlled or even eradicated with proper inoculation rates - generally defined as 95% of a community receiving the vaccine.\n\nBut vaccination rates have dropped in some communities in recent decades as a loose network of vaccine sceptics have, without evidence, questioned the safety and efficacy of the shots.\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr, recently confirmed as US President Donald Trump's health secretary, has faced strong criticism for his ties to these groups.\n\nMost states require that children receive the MMR vaccine to attend school, but many, including Texas, also allow families to file a conscientious exemption - a non-medical reason to refuse a vaccine requirement.\n\nIn Texas, federal data shows that the state achieved a 94.3% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2023-2024 school year, while New Mexico reached 95%.\n\nBut a state survey of Texas schools found that rates of exemptions were ticking upwards for MMR and other required vaccines.\n\nIn Gaines County, where 57 of the Texas cases were reported, exemptions have surged over the last decade. State data shows 17.62% of students had a conscientious exemption to at least one required vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, up from 7.45% in the 2013-2014 year.\n\nNeighbouring Terry County, home to 20 cases, saw exemption rates go from zero to 3.73% in the same time period.\n\nTexas officials reported that of the 90 cases in their state, 85 were in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unclear.\n\nCBS reports that the area is home to a large Mennonite community, which typically have low vaccination rates due to the group's religious beliefs.\n\nSome officials are reluctant to intervene.\n\n\"We respect everyone's right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated,\" Albert Pilkington, CEO of the nearby Seminole Hospital District, told the Texas Standard. \"That's just what it means to be an American, right?\"\n\nUS children have been vaccinated against measles since 1963. The jab was improved and combined with vaccines for the mumps and rubella viruses about a decade later, and is widely considered to be safe.\n\nPrior to the vaccine's introduction, around 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles each year and 400\u2013500 people died. In 2024, the US reported 285 cases with 114 hospitalisations.\n\nHealth officials in New Mexico are offering a free vaccine clinic this week in an effort to boost protection. Texas also directed residents to contact their doctors or visit a clinic to get vaccinated if they have not previously received a shot.",

Born in 1926, Mr Turski survived the Lodz Ghetto, extermination camp Auschwitz-Birkenau and two death marches as a teenager. Later dedicating himself to history and journalism in post-war Poland, he co-founded Warsaw's landmark Jewish history museum and became president of the International Auschwitz Committee. He drew international attention on the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation in 2020, when he remarked Auschwitz \"did not fall from the sky\" and warned it could happen again.\n\nMr Turski was born as Moshe Turbowicz and spent much of his childhood in the Polish city of Lodz. After the Nazis conquered Poland in 1940, he and his family were moved to the Jewish ghetto established in the city which was plagued by disease, starvation and forced labour. In 1944, his parents and younger brother were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau \u2013 where Mr Turski, still a teenager, was to arrive two weeks later in one of the last transports from the Lodz Ghetto. Mr Turski's father and brother were killed in the gas chambers, while his mother was sent to work at the Bergen Belsen camp in northern Germany. In January 1945, as Soviet troops advanced, Mr Turski was among the 60,000 prisoners the Nazis forced to walk west in what came to be known as death marches.\n\nGetty Images Mr Turski with then Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon on a visit to Auschwitz in 2013.\n\nHe first marched to concentration camp Buchenwald and later on to Terezin, where he was liberated on the brink of death from exhaustion and typhus. He said it was as if he had amnesia after leaving Auschwitz, where he did not return for 20 years. \"I could never forget that I was in Auschwitz, because I have a number tattooed on my arm and I see it every day,\" he told Polish outlet Onet. \"However, after the war, I was struck by amnesia... I remembered individual episodes perfectly: arriving at the camp, a few other things, some stories from the death marches. Everything else was blurred, though.\" He rejected an offer to migrate west after the war, instead returning home in the hopes of building a socialist Poland. Mr Turski studied history at the University of Wroc\u0142aw, during which time he took up journalism and worked in political communications. In 1958, he became editor of the magazine Polityka's history section, from which he went on to become an influential journalist and historian.\n\n'Do not be indifferent'",

    "title": "World's sea-ice falls to record low",
    "body": "World's sea-ice falls to record low\n\n15 February 2025 Share Save Mark Poynting and Erwan Rivault BBC Climate & Verify data journalism teams Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows. Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space. But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further. This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.\n\nOver the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.\n\nArctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s. The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s. But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink. Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability. \"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News. \"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\" Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents, as the Arctic is - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice. But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer. The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures. \"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey. \"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\" Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.\n\nAt the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over. But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024. This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down. As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness. \"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London. In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard. This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.\n\nThis very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles. But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable. The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner. Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate. Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year. \"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre. Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild. \"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.\n\nAdditional reporting by Becky Dale",

    "body": "Huge data price hike sparks anger in Nigeria\n\nNigerians have been living through a long cost-of-living crisis with inflation rates not seen for three decades. Any increase in prices adds to the struggle for many to make ends meet.\n\nA price jump was expected as the telecoms regulatory body had approved an increase, but in an announcement three weeks ago it said it had capped it at 50%. The phone companies wanted to boost their revenue in order to cover rising costs.\n\nMTN - Nigeria's largest operator - trebled the cost of one of its most popular weekly offers. Airtel has also increased its tariffs.\n\nNigerians are expressing outrage over a big jump in the price of mobile data charged by some of the country's major phone networks.\n\nIn response to customer complaints, MTN said on X that the price adjustment was necessary to serve subscribers better.\n\n\"We apologize for any inconvenience caused,\u201d the company added. Airtel is yet to comment.\n\nSubscribers only realised what had happened when they went to buy data over the past few hours.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Airtel for more information on the changes.\n\nMany comments on social media called out the increase saying that it could cut off a lot of people at a time when the economy is in turmoil.\n\nOne target for criticism has been the rise in MTN's 15GB weekly bundle from 2,000 naira ($1.33; \u00a31.08) to 6,000 naira ($3.99).\n\n\"What sort of outrageous increase is that?... Just making sure the masses suffer more,\" one commenter on X said.\n\n\"Triple the amount?

    "body": "UN expert's concern over activist charges\n\n13 February 2025 Share Save Bea Swallow BBC News, Bristol Share Save\n\nPalestine Action The group were arrested after a ram raid at an Elbit facility in Bristol\n\nA human rights expert has written to the government expressing concern over a group of protesters the Home Office says are being detained under anti-terrorism laws. Members of Palestine Action are alleged to have used a vehicle to break through the doors of Elbit Systems UK near Bristol under claims the firm supplies arms to Israel. In his letter Professor Ben Saul, an independent expert appointed by the UN to monitor human rights, says the group have been classified as high-security prisoners with \"restricted status\", and denied access to legal support, family visits and healthcare. The Home Office said: \"The CPS has decided that there is sufficient evidence to submit to the court that these offences have a terrorism connection.\"\n\nThe activists are alleged to have stormed the building and damaged property in a bid to disrupt operations for the alleged manufacturing of weapons to Israel - something the firm denies. Elbit Systems UK has previously denied that the facility supplies the Israeli military with arms. A spokesperson said: \"Any claims that this facility supplies the Israeli military or Israeli Ministry of Defence are categorically false.\"\n\nA total of 10 people have been charged with criminal damage, violent disorder, and aggravated burglary using a sledgehammer in relation to the incident, which happened in the early hours of 6 August: Jordan Devlin, 30, of Stoke Newington High Street, London Charlotte Head, 28, of Upper Clapton Road, Hackney, London Leona Kamio, 28, of Clifden Road, Hackney, London Fatema Rajwani, 20, of Commonside, East Mitcham, Merton Zoe Rogers, 20, of Selborne Road, Southgate, Enfield Hannah Davidson, 51, of Calder Gardens, Edinburgh Ian Sanders, 45, of Regent Place, Royal Leamington Spa William Plastow, 33, of High Croft Avenue, Manchester Madeline Norman, 29, of Wester Drylaw Drive, Edinburgh Samuel Corner, 22, of Rock Hill, Georgeham, Devon was also charged with GBH with intent and two counts of ABH A previous hearing was told a decommissioned prison van was driven through the doors of the building, and two responding police officers and a security guard were injured in the ram raid. In response to the letter from Professor Saul, the Home Office said: \"Those who are the subject of the letter have been charged with several substantive offences: criminal damage, violent disorder, aggravated burglary, grievous bodily harm with intent, and actual bodily harm.\" It added there was \"sufficient evidence\" of a terrorism connection.\n\nPalestine Action Elbit Systems UK have previously denied supplying the Israeli army with weapons\n\nThe activists were initially detained at police stations in Bristol for 36 hours, during which time they were denied access to legal representation, and were not permitted to contact their families or the outside world, Prof Saul claimed. Once this time period had expired, the group were further arrested for an alternative offence under section five of the Terrorism Act 2006. Prof Saul said the group were held for a further seven days under this terror-related offence, where they were then transferred to police stations in Hammersmith and Newbury for questioning. He claimed there was a \"significant delay\" in notifying their families of this transfer - which they submit amounts to \"enforced disappearance\". The letter also claims the defendants have experienced difficulty in practicing their religious rights while detained, as well as accessing medication. In addition, it says their mail is being monitored and restricted on the basis of \"national security\". \"We query whether counter-terrorism laws may have been used to circumvent procedural safeguards in relation to detention,\" the letter states.\n\nPA Media The defendants are currently being held in HMP Bronzefield (pictured) and HMP Wormwood Scrubs, the UN says\n\nThe letter from Prof Saul has also queried on behalf of the defendants whether their restricted status is \"disproportionate and inconsistent\" with the treatment of other individuals charged with \"the same ordinary offences\". It wrote: \"Treating direct action, - albeit involving some violence - as 'terrorism' over-states the nature of the conduct and seriously risks chilling the exercise of freedom of expression\". However, a spokesperson for the Counter Terrorism Policing South East Unit, which is leading the investigation, said the individuals have been \"held in conjunction with the relevant legislation and codes of practice for arrest and detention whilst in custody\". A provisional trial date has been set for 17 November.\n\nCorrection 13 February 2025: An earlier version of this article stated that the letter came from the UN. In fact, Professor Ben Saul wrote the letter. He is an expert appointed by the UN to monitor human rights, but he acts independently. This has been corrected.",

    "body": "TV chef Gino D'Acampo denies inappropriate behaviour claims\n\nIn a statement to ITV News via his legal team, D'Acampo \"firmly denied\" the \"deeply upsetting\" allegations.\n\nThe claims came to light in an investigation published by ITV News, which said it had spoken to \"dozens\" of people who accused him of \"unacceptable\", \"distressing\" and \"horrendous\" comments.\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo has denied a number of allegations of inappropriate and intimidating behaviour on the set of his television programmes.\n\nITV News published a number of allegations from anonymous accusers who said they had worked with D'Acampo on TV productions. BBC News has not spoken to his accusers nor has it verified their claims.\n\nThey accused him of aggressive behaviour, using abusive language during outbursts on set and using sexualised language.\n\nHis behaviour allegedly left some production staff fearful and uncomfortable, ITV News reported.\n\nIt added that most people it spoke to were freelancers and had been too scared to complain at the time for fear of risking future employment.\n\nOne woman claimed D'Acampo made sexualised comments to her while she was working with him on a magazine shoot in 2011.\n\nShe said: \"I definitely saw it as some kind of power play. The very act of what he said was aggressive.\"\n\nIn a response provided to ITV News by Gino D'Acampo's legal team, said the allegation had never before been raised or put to him.\n\n\"He does not recall it, nor accept that this happened. Mr D'Acampo is horrified to be accused of \"power play\" and an \"aggressive act\". He emphatically and unequivocally denies these allegations\" .\n\nAnother woman interviewed by ITV News alleged D'Acampo opened the door to her in only his boxing shorts while working on location for a TV production several years later.\n\nShe claimed he then jumped on the bed and made reference to his penis, making her feel \"disgusted\".\n\nGino D'Acampo's legal team said he \"categorically denies\" the allegations.\n\n\"This is the first time, six years later, he has been informed of these alleged incidents, and he does not accept them, not least because some of this is considered by Mr D'Acampo to be a fabricated work of fiction,\" they said.\n\nResponding more broadly to the investigation, D'Acampo's representatives told ITV News that he \"firmly denied\" the claims. He said he had \"never been made aware of these matters previously\".\n\nA statement continued: \"I am a father, husband and have worked with well over 1,500 people on around 80 productions in my career, which I have been so proud of.\n\n\"I take such matters extremely seriously,\" he said, adding that the suggestion that he acted in an improper way was \"deeply upsetting\".\n\nD'Acampo, 48, has been a regular on UK television since the early 2000s. He has primarily worked for ITV, including on a number of cooking and travel shows, as well as making appearances on other entertainment programmes.\n\nThe Italian-born chef and broadcaster has also made appearances on BBC programmes.\n\nIn a statement, ITV said production companies \"have the primary responsibility for the duty of care of everyone they work with\".\n\nThe broadcaster said it had \"strengthened\" policies about what standards they expect from production companies it works with in the last five years.\n\nA statement continued: \"All of the concerns and complaints raised by those who have spoken to ITN [the producer of ITV News] describe behaviour which is inappropriate and unacceptable.\n\n\"Most of them were not reported to ITV at the time.

    "body": "Rugby player can't remember career due to dementia\n\n18 February 2025 Share Save Angela Ferguson BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images Alix Popham says he was told by a neurologist that he had suffered over 100,000 hits to his brain during his rugby career\n\nFormer rugby union player Alix Popham has said jerseys and medals are the only reminders he has of playing in big matches he has \"no recollection of\". The ex-Wales flanker, who had a 14-year professional career, was diagnosed with early onset dementia at the age of 40. He told Newsnight he believed this diagnosis was due to head injuries he had sustained during his rugby career. \"My neurologist, when he diagnosed me, they worked out I had over 100,000 sub-concussive hits in my brain,\" he said.\n\nPopham described sub-concussive hits as any contact \"when your brain rattles around inside against your skull on every hit\", including hits to the body as well as to the head. He is one of two former rugby professionals diagnosed with early onset dementia who are calling on the sport's governing bodies to end their legal fight with ex-players in the courts. More than 560 former players are suing the sport's governing bodies for the impact of head collisions during their career. Popham said that he had jerseys on the wall and medals to show from big games, \"but memories, vivid memories of the scoreline, the weather, the stadium, I've got no recollection of that\". He also said he could not recall meeting Nelson Mandela before one game in South Africa in 2003 after suffering a traumatic brain injury and ending up in hospital. \"I've got no recollection of being in that stadium or being in that game and, unfortunately, most of my career is the same,\" said the former forward.\n\nAlix Popham says the 20-minute red card punishment being trialled during the Six Nations tournament is not enough of a deterrent\n\n'Two or three week bans really isn't enough'\n\nPopham is the founder of the Head for Change charity, whose aim is to support those who suffer from sports-related brain injuries. The Six Nations tournament returns this weekend and a new 20-minute red card punishment is being trialled during the tournament, where a player is removed from the game but the team returns to its full complement once that period is over. But Dr Willie Stewart, a world-leading expert on brain injury, told Newsnight the new rule \"places the spectacle of the game ahead of player's brains\". He said he did not think sending a player off for 20 minutes was sufficient punishment for a potentially dangerous tackle which could cause brain damage. Popham called for a six-to-eight week punishment for a red card \"so you learn and you don't make that same mistake\". \"These players are getting two or three week bans which really isn't enough to make them change their habits and, to me, that just shows player welfare isn't their number one priority,\" he added.\n\nMel Popham said she saw her husband \"falling apart in front of me\"\n\nPopham, who played in two World Cups for Wales, told Newsnight his initial symptoms of early onset dementia included \"losing my temper over, really, nothing\" and being unable to recall \"important conversations\" with his wife shortly after. He also suffered from severe headaches and would lose his train of thought in conversations. Mel Popham said she and her husband had to take the difficult decision not to try for a second baby when he received his diagnosis. \"That was really hard, particularly hard for me, trying to be strong for Al at the time and my stepdaughters and Darcy and the wider family and that was a really difficult personal decision,\" said Mel.\n\n'It was really frightening'\n\nReflecting on Popham's diagnosis, Mel said: \"We had everything going for us. We'd recently got married, had Darcy, living in a house we loved and our world was just changing. \"It was really frightening.\" The couple said they wanted action rather than \"empty words\" when it came to player welfare. Reflecting on the impact of injuries sustained during his career, Popham said: \"I wish I knew then what I know now because when you were seeing stars you wouldn't carry on. \"You would take yourself off. You would be honest to the coaches, the physios.\" Former Wales rugby international Ian Buckett died with dementia last year at the age of 56. He was found to have had a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) which is linked with repeated blows to the head but can only be diagnosed after death. Researchers from a number of academic institutions includes Oxford Brookes University said they had found \"conclusive evidence\" that repetitive head impacts cause CTE.\n\nFormer England youth international Chris Simpson-Daniel was diagnosed with early onset dementia at the age of 43\n\nFormer England youth international Chris Simpson-Daniel was diagnosed with early onset dementia at the age of 43 in 2022. Simpson-Daniel told Newsnight he had attempted to take his own life on two occasions.

    "title": "London Fashion Week: Plus-size male model wants to lead a change",
    "body": "What's it like to be a male plus-size model at London Fashion Week ?\n\n24 February 2025 Share Save Jonelle Awomoyi, Jameel Shariff and Jared Evitts BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images James Corbin has been a model since he left university in 2020\n\nJames Corbin never expected to break into the fashion industry. But a message he got in 2020 - thanks to a photographer who'd saved a picture of him a year earlier - changed all that. \"I got a DM, and I thought it was to help out on set, and it was actually to model for Vogue Italia,\" says James. James is a plus-size male model - and says \"meaningful change\" for him would mean all body types get equal representation and the category no longer exists. After walking down the catwalk at London Fashion week, he says modelling should be about \"showing people how to wear things in different ways, their bodies included.\"\n\nJames says he initially thought the message from Vogue was a prank. \"I said it to the photographer: 'Is this a joke?' \"At that time, I didn't feel I was a model. A model doesn't look like me. I've never opened a magazine and seen someone that looks like me.\" The 2010s were the era of body positivity as social media began to challenge conventional ideas of beauty. Some of the most famous names linked to the movement are female, but male members of the movement were also pushing the message. James says he doesn't meet the industry standard of a male model - \"tall and slim, a perfect mannequin\". \"Someone like myself isn't that,\" says James. \"By definition, I am a plus-size model just based on my body size, but not my ability. \"In clothes, I'm a 3XL, 2XL. I wear a 44in waist, 40in waist. \"It's a real body. It's a body that anybody walks into a store has when they're going to shop.\" James says he sees it as his mission to challenge the standards. \"I represent what people don't see and people feel they can't be involved in fashion because their bodies a certain way,\" he says.\n\n\"I'm happy to be the future of male models\"\n\nJames says he's noticed a decline in the use of plus-sized models within the fashion industry. \"It seems there was a moment where there were so many things happening. It was looking amazing,\" he says. Others, including the editorial director of British Vogue, have said they're concerned about the body positivity movement falling out of fashion. Recent high-profile events have tended to feature very slim models - a trend some have linked to the rise in popularity of weight-loss jabs. James says this appears to have taken hold on the High Street, too, and he has been finding it harder to shop for clothes in his size and been advised to search online instead. Some people criticise body positivity campaigners as promoting unhealthy lifestyles, but James rejects this. \"Everyone should be healthy,\" he says. \"I go to the gym, I eat well because I need to have the strength, have the stamina to model, but I don't believe I should have to change my body to fit a society standard. \"The way that my body is built, as a black, Jamaican, Kenyan and Bajan boy, I will never be the stick-thin model even if I'm to lose all the weight. \"So it's to show different body types need to be represented regardless.\"\n\nAnd when it comes to loving his body, James says the answer is being honest about how he feels. \"When I started modelling, I wasn't confident in my body. I was really honest about that in my journey,\" he says. \"This is the new generation of people that speak up and I'm happy to be a part of that and be in the future of male models.\"",

    "body": "Pope Francis 'alert' after respiratory failure\n\n3 March 2025 Share Save Sarah Rainsford BBC News Reporting from Rome Jacqueline Howard BBC News Reporting from London Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nPope Francis is alert after suffering two episodes of \"acute respiratory failure\" on Monday afternoon, the Vatican has said. Doctors were forced to intervene to clear mucus from the Pope's lungs, an update from the Holy See said, though it said he was alert throughout. The 88-year-old pontiff has resumed the use of an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing, but remains \"alert, focused and cooperative\", the Vatican said. This is now the third serious downturn since the 88-year-old pontiff was admitted to hospital 18 days ago with pneumonia.\n\nOn Friday, Pope Francis suffered an \"isolated\" breathing crisis involving vomiting, the Vatican said. Updates from the Holy See reported that he responded well to oxygen therapy, with Vatican officials saying on Sunday the Pope no longer required \"non-invasive mechanical ventilation, only high-flow oxygen therapy\". Following Monday's episodes, Pope Francis has resumed that mechanical ventilation. His illness has meant that Pope Francis has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person for three weeks in a row, with the Vatican publishing his written comments instead. Officials said the text, sent from his hospital room in Rome, had been written \"in the past few days\". In it, the Pope thanked people for their prayers and thanked his medical team for their care. He will also miss the procession and mass this Wednesday that mark the first day of Lent, the six-week period leading to Easter. Hundreds of Catholics gathered outside in St Peter's Square on Monday for an eighth evening to pray for the Pope's health, many carrying rosary beads as they headed across the cobbles towards the Basilica.\n\nThe crowd, a mixture of priests and nuns based in Rome and Catholic pilgrims here for a Jubilee year, were led by an American cardinal. \"I come every night to pray, but this night I am pretty worried,\" Javier, a Romanian priest, voiced the feelings of many on the square. \"We still have hope, but it doesn't look good.\" \"It looks bad, and that's a shame because we really like Francis,\" Patricia, a Spanish catholic from Toledo, told the BBC. She was following the prayers with her husband and young daughter. \"He's really opened the doors of the church to many, like LGBT people. I think they will look for a more conservative pope next, to stop the change.\" Catholics have also been visiting the Gemelli hospital in Rome to pray for him - hoping he might come to the window, as has happened in the past. But although the Vatican recently described the Pope's condition as stable, he remains too sick even to greet the crowd below.\n\nReuters",

    "body": "Utah becomes first US state to ban fluoride in its water\n\nUtah's move to remove the mineral has been criticised by experts, who worry it will have consequences for oral health, especially for children.\n\nFluoride has been added to US drinking water since 1945 to prevent cavities.\n\nGovernor Spencer Cox signed the ban into law this week, which will go into effect on 7 May. Other states, including Florida and Ohio, are weighing similar legislation.\n\nUtah has become the first US state to ban the use of fluoride in its public water, following concerns raised by health secretary Robert F Kennedy that the mineral poses potential health risks.\n\nThe bill, signed by Cox on Thursday, prohibits communities from adding fluoride to their public water supplies.\n\nThe law does not mention any public health concerns related to the mineral, but Republican state lawmaker Stephanie Gricius - who introduced the bill in the state legislature - has argued that there is research suggesting fluoride could have possible cognitive effects in children.\n\nGricius has said that her bill would give citizens a choice whether they want to consume fluoride or not.\n\nThis concern over fluoride was previously raised by Kennedy, the US health secretary, who said in November that \"the Trump White House will advise all US water systems to remove fluoride from public water\".\n\nHe alleged the chemical found in toothpaste and regularly used by dentists \"is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease\".\n\nMost public health experts have rejected these claims and alleged that Kennedy had cited data from studies conducted in countries with far higher levels of fluoride in their water systems than the US has.\n\nThe American Dental Association sharply criticised Utah for its decision, saying that it shows \"wanton disregard for the oral health and well-being of their constituents\".\n\n\"It is disheartening to see that a proven, public health policy, which exists for the greater good of an entire community's oral health, has been dismantled based on distorted pseudoscience,\" the association's president, Denver dentist Brett Kessler, said in a statement.\n\nMany public health groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have long supported adding small amounts of fluoride to drinking water.\n\nThe US Public Health Service reduced the amount of fluoride it recommended adding to water in 2015, but the federal government has encouraged states since the 1960s to add small amounts of the chemical to water to help prevent cavities and aid oral health.\n\nRecent court rulings have led to the reduction of fluoride in US water, and some experts have questioned the continued need for it in water systems given its wide availability in toothpaste and other dental products.\n\nMost of western Europe does not add fluoride to its water. In England, about one in 10 people has fluoridated drinking water, though a programme has since been introduced to fluoridate water for 1.6 million people in north-east England.\n\nBy contrast, around 63% of the US population have fluoridated water.\n\nExperts who support putting fluoride in water says studies show that community water fluoridation prevents at least 25% of tooth decay in children and adults.\n\n\"The scientific weight of sound evidence around the benefit of community water fluoridation is clear and compelling,\" the American Dental Association said in October of last year.\n\nProf Avijit Banerjee, chair of cariology and operative dentistry at King's College London, previously told the BBC that \"the potential harmful effects of fluoride cited have not been associated with the very low levels of fluoride used in water fluoridation programmes\".",

    "title": "Greenland: JD Vance takes ominous message to Danish territory",
    "body": "JD Vance's ominous pitch to Greenland\n\n29 March 2025 Share Save Andrew Harding Reporting from Nuuk, Greenland Share Save\n\nReuters A cultural tour of Greenland by JD Vance's wife Usha has been cancelled\n\nA green shimmer, like a curtain of light being drawn across the night sky, formed beside the impossibly bright stars above Nuuk late on Friday evening. The appearance of the spectacular northern lights \u2013 a common wonder in these parts \u2013 seemed to mark the end of a hugely significant day in the arctic, one that brought icebound Greenland's hopes and challenges into the sharpest relief. It was a day in which an acquisitive foreign power had sent an uninvited delegation to the world's largest island with an uncomfortable message. On a brief visit to a remote US military base in the far north of Greenland, US Vice-President JD Vance may have tried at times to soften his boss's stated aim of simply annexing the autonomous Danish territory. \"We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary,\" Vance said, perhaps attempting to sound reassuring. But the vice-president's overarching message remained stark and intimidating: the world, the climate, and the Arctic region are changing fast, and Greenland needs to wake up to threats posed by an expansionist China; long-standing Western security partnerships have run their course; the only way the island can protect itself, its values and its mineral wealth is by abandoning weak and miserly Danish overlords and turning instead to the muscular and protective embrace of the US.\n\n\"We need to wake up from a failed, 40-year consensus that said that we could ignore the encroachment of powerful countries as they expand their ambitions,\" Vance told US troops at America's Pituffik military base. \"We can't just bury our head in the sand - or, in Greenland, bury our head in the snow - and pretend that the Chinese are not interested in this very large landmass.\" If you look at a map of the world that has the north pole at its centre, rather than the equator, it is easy to see how Greenland suddenly switches from being an easily overlooked smudge of uninhabited territory and into a key strategic landmass. It is at the heart of what many analysts now accept as an emerging power struggle between China, the US, and Russia, for control of the arctic, its minerals and its shipping lanes. But the speed and contempt with which the Trump White House has rejected its traditional reliance on Western allies \u2013 Nato in particular \u2013 has left its partners bewildered. \"Not justifiable,\" was the bristling response of Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen after hearing Vance attack her government as he stood on its sovereign territory.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'Like a threat'\n\nBut 1,500km (930 miles) south of the Pituffik base, in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, the American story vied for attention with a very different local event on Friday. \"We will prevail,\" a smiling crowd sang, at a ceremony to celebrate the formation of a new coalition government for Greenland. The mood felt mostly joyful and communal, with people locking arms and swaying gently as a band played inside the town's house of culture. It was a powerful reminder of the shared values that bind Greenland's tiny, and overwhelmingly native Inuit population together - the need for consensus and co-operation in an often hostile natural climate, the desire to protect and celebrate Inuit culture and the wish to be respected by outsiders, be they from familiar but distant Denmark or marginally closer America. \"There are many ways to say things. But I think the way [Trump] is saying it is not the way. It's like a threat,\" said Lisbeth Karline Poulsen, 43, a local artist attending the ceremony. Her reaction appeared to capture the broader mood here - a recent poll showed just 6% of the population support the idea of being part of the US.\n\nThe journey to independence\n\nUnder its new government, and with overwhelming public support, Greenland is beginning a slow, very cautious move towards full independence from Denmark. It's a process that will likely take many years, and which will involve lengthy dialogue with both Copenhagen and Washington. After all, Greenlanders well understand that their economy needs to be far more developed if their bid for independence is to stand any realistic chance of success.

The Portuguese-flagged Solong and US-registered tanker Stena Immaculate crashed off the East Yorkshire coast at about 10:00 GMT on Monday. Filipino national Mark Angelo Pernia, 38, was named as the crew member of the Solong who was missing and presumed dead, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Vladimir Motin, 59, of Primorsky in St Petersburg, Russia, captain of the Solong, did not enter a plea and was remanded in custody by Hull magistrates to appear before the Central Criminal Court in London on April 14.\n\nMr Motin stood in the glass-front dock at Hull Magistrates' Court for the 35-minute hearing. He spoke through a translator to confirm his name, age and address, and that he understood the charges. The court heard how all 23 people on the tanker were rescued along with 13 of 14 crew members from the Solong but that Mr Pernia could not be located.\n\nEPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock The Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of aviation fuel at the time of the crash\n\nHumberside Police arrested Mr Motin on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter on Monday evening, hours after the collision. The force said he had been charged on Friday evening. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) is trying to establish the cause of the crash. It said initial inquiries found the Solong was travelling from Grangemouth to Rotterdam and had often sailed the same route. \"At 09:47 GMT it struck the Stena Immaculate that was at anchor off the entrance to the River Humber,\" the MAIB said. On Friday, Stena Bulk said salvage experts from SMIT Salvage had successfully boarded Stena Immaculate to conduct a thorough assessment. The vessel was carrying 220,000 barrels of aviation fuel. The Stena Immaculate is still at anchor at the point where the collision happened, which is about 12 miles off the East Yorkshire coast, near Withernsea. The MAIB said the salvage process was \"necessarily methodical, comprehensive and ongoing\" and would \"require time to complete fully\". Chief coastguard Paddy O'Callaghan said that aerial surveillance flights continued to monitor the vessels and confirmed \"there continues to be no cause for concern from pollution\" from either ship. All 23 crew on board Stena Immaculate were Americans who are currently in Grimsby and are likely to be repatriated in due course, the BBC understands.

    "body": "At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up\n\n18 March 2025 Share Save Brian Wheeler Political reporter Share Save\n\nPA Media\n\nThe government has announced plans for major changes to the benefits system aimed at cutting the growing amount the UK spends on welfare.\n\nStricter tests for personal independence payments (Pips)\n\nPip is paid to people in England and Wales who have difficulty completing everyday tasks or getting around as a result of a long-term physical or mental health condition. It is not means tested and is available to people who are working. The payments will go up in line with inflation this year. But the eligibility criteria will be tightened up from November 2026, potentially resulting in reduced payments for many. It will become harder to qualify for the daily living component of Pip, which starts at \u00a372.65 a week. There will be no change to the mobility component. There will also be a review of the Pip assessment process.\n\nBut those with most severe conditions will not face reassessments\n\nThe government wants more frequent reassessments for many people claiming Pip, with more face-to-face assessments. But those with the most severe, long-term conditions will no longer face any reassessments, under the proposed reforms.\n\nWork capability assessment to be scrapped\n\nThe work capability assessment that determines who is eligible for incapacity benefits will be scrapped in 2028, under the proposals. Instead, people applying for health-related financial support and disability benefits will only face one assessment, based on the current Pip system.\n\nIncapacity benefits under universal credit to be halved for new claimants\n\nIncapacity benefits under universal credit will be frozen in cash terms for existing claimants at \u00a397 per week from April next year - this means they will not be increased in line with inflation until 2029/30. The amount will be reduced to \u00a350 per week in 2026/2027 for new claimants. But those receiving the new reduced universal credit health element after April 2026, who have the most severe, life-long health conditions, who have no prospect of improvement and will never be able to work, will see their incomes protected through an additional premium. It also means those in that group will not be reassessed in the future. There will also be an above inflation increase in the standard rate of universal credit for all those seeking work, adding up to \u00a3775 a year extra by 2029/30. The government says this will help tackle the \"perverse incentives\" in the system that keep people on benefits.\n\nReduced incapacity benefits for under 22s\n\nThose aged under 22 will no longer be able to claim the incapacity benefit top-up to universal credit under these proposals. The government says any savings generated from the delay would be reinvested into work support and training opportunities for this age group. Ministers are also consulting on raising the age at which young people move from Disability Living Allowance for children to Pip from 16 to 18. The idea is that young people will have work and training \"rather than a pathway to economic inactivity\", the DWP says.\n\nMore incentives to work\n\nThe government says it wants to ease people's fears about losing benefits if they take a job and it doesn't work out. Ministers say they will introduce legislation \"as soon as possible\" to guarantee that trying work will not lead to an automatic Pip or work capability reassessment. It's hoped a newly-designed \"support conversation\" will give people who have a health condition or disability help to access work. Consultations will start on the Access to Work scheme, looking at improvements to help people stay in the workplace, with adjustments like aids or assistive tech. Overall, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced a \u00a31bn package of support to help disabled people and those with long-term conditions into work.\n\nDifferences in Scotland and Northern Ireland\n\nMost of the measures apply to the whole of Great Britain. Pip applies to England and Wales only. If there is a cut in the budget for Pip, a proportionate figure will be cut from the amount the Treasury gives to the Scottish government. So Scottish ministers would have the choice of applying a similar scale of cuts, or of finding funds from other spending, or tax, to fill that gap. The benefits system is devolved in Northern Ireland but in practice the Stormont administration mostly copies what is happening in England and Wales. If NI ministers choose not to apply the cuts they would have to fund that by making savings on other parts of their budget or raising more revenue.",

But the drift to south-east Asia and beyond accelerated after the Trump administration started imposing tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018.\n\nIn Cambodia, around 90% of clothing factories are now Chinese-run or Chinese-owned, according to a report by insight and analysis group Research and Markets.\n\nI saw this for myself in Phnom Penh. The garment firms still source most of their materials in China \u2013 so you are right, Grant: Trump\u2019s tariffs have not stopped Chinese firms from setting up shop elsewhere.\n\nRemember - Trump is angry because China sells four times more than it buys from the US.\n\nBack in 2020, after a two-year bitter tit-for-tat trade war, the two sides agreed to a \"Phase One\" trade deal where China pledged to buy an extra $200 billion dollars of US goods. His administration argued that this deal would put money back into the US economy.\n\nUnfortunately, not long after that it was agreed, the pandemic struck, relations between Washington and Beijing soured and the deal fell apart.\n\nBut this is the kind of deal Trump likely hopes to do once again. Will his tactics work?\n\nChina has pledged to fight to the bitter end of any trade war. It will also feel in a better position that during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nBeijing has spent the last five years making new economic partners \u2013 especially throughout the Global South. China is now the lead trade partner for more than 120 countries. This means it is less reliant on trade with the United States, but it's also facing its own economic challenges - and may not want to drag this fight out.",

    "body": "'We don't need a Gail's' - the coffee shop boom dividing locals\n\n9 March 2025 Share Save Lucy Hooker BBC Business reporter Reporting from Macclesfield Share Save\n\nBBC Jane Kent says Macclesfield doesn't need any more places to buy pastries\n\nThere is a cheerful red awning and a newly painted cream wooden shopfront on the market square in Macclesfield. A new bakery cafe has just opened, offering ciabatta and sourdough loaves as well as hot cross buns, syrupy cakes, vegetable quiches and of course coffee. Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival. But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too. A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people \"hate\" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries. Its arrival isn't universally popular here either. \"We don't need another coffee shop,\" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. \"There are too many,\" says Nicola.\n\nNicola Tomlinson and Linda Willdig do not think Macclesfield needs another coffee shop\n\nIn fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Greggs is just around the corner too. So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse. \"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\" At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business. But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming. \"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\" She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour. At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".\n\nStephanie Lamb says she is happy to have something new in town\n\nGail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by. It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May. At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.\n\nKaterina Antos-Lewis Gail's opened in Macclesfield on Friday on a corner site location\n\nEven in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average. So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago. Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks. Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.\n\nMacclesfield has independent butchers, one of the things Gail's looks out for when it is picking a new location\n\nWith enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood. Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key. He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones. \"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists. But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes. It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market. \"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says. If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.\n\nFirefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison says Gail's is just a \"posh Greggs\"\n\nBut retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents. \"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion. \"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents. \"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.\n\nKaren Pearson wants the town to \"stay like it is\"\n\nIn Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer. \"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\". They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents. But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.\n\nLocal independents like Flour, Water, Salt say they aren't worried\n\nIndependents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England. Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands, he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",

somewhere she can read a book for an hour at gails prices that would set her back \u00a3650 yes its pricey she says but she is still planning to give it a whirl stephanie lamb says she is happy to have something new in town gails a name that suggests a traditional singleowner cafe favours attractive old buildings often ones vacated as bank branches close especially if it is a corner site that means its more visible to passers by it has 170 outlets mostly clustered in london and the south east but this year it plans to open around 40 more including ely cambridgeshire later this month bath in april and buxton derbyshire in may at fridays opening in macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square katerina antoslewis gails opened in macclesfield on friday on a corner site location even in the wake of the cost of living crisis we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat nearly twothirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week according to world coffee portal spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average so coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses there are now 11450 branded chain outlets across the uk up from 9800 five years ago speciality chains like black sheep coffee coffee1 and blank street are springing up in city centres while the giants like costa and starbucks are opening drivethroughs and outlets in retail parks caffe nero has bought up several smaller chains in different parts of the country and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties macclesfield has independent butchers one of the things gails looks out for when it is picking a new location with enthusiasm for coffee so strong its something of a mystery to gails chief executive tom molnar why people object to his chain he feels misunderstood mr molnar a joint owner with private equity backing has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003 but says its not just about coffee its role as a neighbourhood bakery baking fresh instore and in regional bakery hubs every day is key hes hoping to roll gails out to many more neighbourhoods including less affluent ones its not supposed to be posh he insists but for now they pick very carefully where to open using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes it flags up things like whether there is a local butcher bookshops a park schools churches or a farmers market i prefer a place thats evolving and growing rather than some place thats too established he says if the algorithm homes in on a particular high street it is a vote of confidence in that towns future firefighter and local councillor anthony harrison says gails is just a posh greggs but retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that gails is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents gails is moving into areas with strong local identities and when that happens there will always be a reaction says kate hardcastle founder of insight with passion its not just about a bakery opening i think its also about what it represents some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation while others worry its another step back to our high streets looking like carbon copies of each other she says karen pearson wants the town to stay like it is in flour water salt a direct rival to gails selling sourdough bread bagels coffeeiced buns and sausage rolls that is just yards from the new shop some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer gails isnt welcome here says karen pearson a businesswoman who lives just outside macclesfield she and her friends are worried that the arrival of gails means the town is on the up when in fact they would rather it stayed like it is theyre not keen on big corporations coming into the town concerned they might squeeze out independents but firefighter and local councillor anthony harrison reckons gails is no match for a place like flour water salt its just a posh greggs he says local independents like flour water salt say they arent worried independents may not be as under threat as people fear says graham soult a retail consultant from the north of england local owners can offer a more personal touch respond to local tastes and demands he says while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula",

It takes the party's total number of council seats to more than 100. Speaking at a press conference in Westminster, Farage said the defections demonstrated how his party was \"broadening and deepening\". However, it comes as some Reform members are expressing concern about the party's leadership and the suspension of MP Rupert Lowe from the party.\n\nOn Sunday, Maria Bowtell, a councillor on East Riding of Yorkshire Council, quit the party. She accused the leadership of \"a lack of integrity and resolve\" and said the treatment of Lowe had been \"the final straw\". Farage acknowledged that his party had experienced a \"little bit of turbulence\" over the past few weeks. He said the suspension of Lowe had caused \"consternation\" adding: \"Any argument that's seen to happen within the family does, but I can promise you that in terms of our progress and our planning, that upset is very much at the edges.\"\n\nLowe, the MP for Great Yarmouth, was suspended by the party and referred to police over allegations he made \"threats of physical violence\" against party chairman Zia Yusuf. The party also said it had received allegations of bullying in Lowe's parliamentary and constituency office. Lowe has said the party's allegations are \"untrue and false\". He argued he had been suspended for criticising Farage in a newspaper interview. Addressing the row, Farage said: \"We've been increasingly concerned about the behaviour of one of our members of Parliament, and when we found out that some serious complaints have gone in, we thought, you know what, let's just suspend the whip and let's find out what the truth is, and we will wait.\" He said the report they had commissioned into to the allegations could be completed this week.

    "body": "India watches warily as Bangladesh-Pakistan ties thaw\n\n17 March 2025 Share Save Anbarasan Ethirajan South Asia Regional Editor Share Save\n\nGetty Images Bangladesh imported 50,000 tonnes of rice from Pakistan in February\n\nThe dramatic political developments in Bangladesh that led to prime minister Sheikh Hasina being ousted last year have thrown up many surprises - including Dhaka's growing closeness with one-time foe Pakistan. Last month, after decades of troubled relations, the two countries began directly trading for the first time, with Dhaka importing 50,000 tonnes of rice from Pakistan. Direct flights and military contacts have also been revived, visa procedures have been simplified, and there are reports of co-operation on security matters. The countries - separated by the landmass of India - have deep, painful historical ties. The animosity between them goes back to 1971, when Bangladesh - then known as East Pakistan - launched a struggle to gain independence from Islamabad. India supported the Bengali rebels during the nine-month war which led to the formation of Bangladesh. While the scars from that period run deep, Dhaka had cordial relations with Islamabad between 2001 and 2006, when a coalition of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami governed the country. This changed during Hasina's 15-year rule from 2009 - when she was strongly backed by Delhi and maintained a distance from Pakistan. But after she fled to India following mass protests against her government, ties seem to be thawing. \"For the past 15 years, the Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship was on a slightly difficult trajectory,\" says Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, adding that the relationship seems to now be returning to that of \"two normal neighbours\". The developments are being watched closely, particularly in India, which has a long history of hostile relations with Pakistan.\n\nX/Shehbaz Sharif The leaders of Pakistan and Bangladesh have expressed a desire to boost ties\n\nRelations between Dhaka and Delhi have been frosty since Hasina's exit. India has not reacted to Bangladesh's demands to extradite her to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her. Some experts think the reviving of relations between Dhaka and Islamabad is a strategic move. \"Pakistan and Bangladesh have a tactical relationship at the moment. Together, they want to represent a pushback against the dominance of India,\" says Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at King's College in London. There have been other developments apart from starting direct trade. Muhammad Yunus, head of the interim Bangladesh government, met Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at multilateral forums several times in recent months. And then there is a growing military relationship. A high-level Bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to Pakistan in January and held talks with influential army chief General Asim Munir. The Bangladeshi navy also participated in a multinational maritime exercise organised by Pakistan off the Karachi coast in February. . Veena Sikri, who was India's high commissioner to Bangladesh between 2003 and 2006, describes the growing closeness between Dhaka and Islamabad as a \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" moment. During her tenure in Dhaka, she said, India repeatedly raised the issue of \"Indian insurgents getting trained inside Bangladesh with the support of the ISI [Pakistan's intelligence agency] and a section of the Bangladeshi military\". \"We even provided evidence to Bangladeshi authorities,\" she said. Authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh denied these allegations at the time. The long, porous border between India and Bangladesh makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India's north-eastern states to cross over from Bangladesh. But, after Hasina's Awami League came to power in 2009, it cracked down on these groups and dismantled their bases. So the revival of military ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan is \"a major security concern for India\", says Ms Sikri. \"It's not just the military relationship. The Pakistani establishment is also reviving ties with Bangladeshi Islamist parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami, which supported Islamabad during Bangladesh's independence war,\" she adds. The Yunus administration's press office has flatly rejected Indian media reports that senior ISI officials have visited Dhaka. It has also described reports that claim Pakistani operatives were working to reopen a camp of an Indian insurgent group in Bangladesh as \"baseless\". Pakistan's military did not respond to BBC questions on India's concerns over the future role of the ISI in Bangladesh. Analysts say Bangladeshi politicians are aware that, given the close economic and linguistic ties, Dhaka cannot afford to take an anti-India stance. And despite apprehensions in Delhi, Bangladeshi diplomats argue that ties with Pakistan cannot be normalised unless issues related to the 1971 war are resolved.\n\nGetty Images Bangladesh, backed by the Indian army, gained independence from Pakistan in 1971 after months of war\n\nDuring the war, hundreds of thousands of Bengalis were killed and tens of thousands of women were raped. The war ended with more than 90,000 Pakistani security and civilian personnel surrendering to the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces in what is seen as a humiliating chapter in Islamabad. Bangladesh has demanded a formal apology from Pakistan for the atrocities committed during the war but Islamabad has shown no inclination to do so. \"Pakistan needs to own the crimes that had taken place during the independence war,\" said Mr Kabir, the former Bangladeshi diplomat. \"We had also raised the issue of the division of pre-1971 assets between the two nations in several bilateral meetings with Pakistan.\" Even former Pakistani military officers like Ikram Sehgal accept that \"the main stumbling block in bilateral ties is the requirement of the Bangladeshis that Pakistanis should apologise for what happened in 1971\". However, the retired Pakistan army major insists that Bangladesh should also address the issue of attacks by Bengalis on Urdu speakers during the struggle for independence. \"I was a witness to the atrocities that took place against the Urdu-speaking Bihari people [in East Pakistan],\" Mr Sehgal, who now lives in Karachi, told the BBC.\n\nGetty Images Last year, hundreds were killed in the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971\n\nWhile history casts a shadow over ties between Dhaka and Islamabad, economists point out the two countries can first focus on improving bilateral trade, which currently stands at less than $700m (\u00a3540m), mostly in favour of Pakistan. \"Pakistan's more than 250 million population is a solid market for Bangladesh in the medium to long term,\" says Sabrin Beg, an associate professor of economics at the University of Delaware. Currently, there are constraints including high tariffs on both sides and businesses and exporters face visa and travel obstacles, she points out. However, Ms Beg says \"improved bilateral political and trade relations will ease these constraints\". Some of these issues may be discussed during Pakistani foreign minister Ishaq Dar's visit to Dhaka in April. By the end of the year Bangladesh is expected to hold general elections and a new government may have a different set of foreign policy priorities. But, whatever happens, the stakes are high for Delhi, which strongly feels that a stable and friendly Bangladesh is necessary to maintain peace and stability in its north-eastern states.",

    "body": "Rachel Reeves is feeling the heat ahead of her Spring Statement\n\n22 March 2025 Share Save Laura Kuenssberg \u2022 @bbclaurak Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nIn a discussion ahead of next week's statement, the chancellor hints at a more guarded approach amid global uncertainty - and issues a warning. A thick skin is a must for our top politicians. There's rolling news, nonstop social media and public scepticism. Add in the battle with the country's deep and persistent problems. And these days the problems include constant and very real global turmoil. The questions for the politicians are profound and that's something the Chancellor Rachel Reeves gets. \"I recognise that with the privilege of doing a job like the one I'm doing today also comes a great deal of scrutiny. I absolutely believe that every policy that I announce, every pound of public money, of taxpayers money that I spend, and every pound that I take from people in terms of taxes is properly scrutinised. That's part of the job,\" she tells me. But next comes an admission, from this professionally tough politician, described to me by one of her colleagues once as 'hard as nails', that when things get personal, she doesn't like it.\n\nGetty Images The signalling for the Spring Statement is that there will be no more increases in government spending\n\n\"One of the things I think that I find hard, even with the thicker skin I guess I must have developed over these last 14 or so years, is some of the personal criticism because that's not the sort of politics that I do,\" she tells me. As admissions go it's modest and general in nature. But read in the context of someone who is taking decisions with big consequences for many, many people's lives while at the same time being someone who has faced awkward questions about her own job history and CV, this may be Reeves' way of telling us that she's feeling the heat.\n\nReal anxiety in the Labour party\n\nPerhaps the admission came because this was an unusual conversation. We were not under the studio lights but instead in the Treasury itself for the making of a BBC documentary, The Making of a Chancellor, trying to understand the thinking behind the big decisions Reeves takes. Our conversation came a couple of hours after the Labour government had revealed billions of pounds of welfare cuts, most notably stricter tests for personal independence payments (Pips). The aim is to save \u00a35bn by 2030.\n\nBut there is real anxiety in her party about what she and Sir Keir Starmer are doing. And when I ask the chancellor about these cuts, she prefers to speak about Labour's broader vision for the economy, instead giving a warning - that this Labour government won't be able to do what its members and backers might have expected and hand out handsome increases to government departments like its predecessor. \"There's growth, real growth every year actually, in public spending, but not at the levels that we were able to deliver under the last Labour government when the economy was growing much more strongly,\" she tells me. \"We've got to ramp it up and continue to ensure that we're doing everything we can to lift living standards and in the end that is through growing the economy. We can't tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services. That's not available in the world we live in today.\"\n\nGetty Images Reeves warns that this Labour government won't be able to do what its members might have expected\n\nThe signalling for the Spring Statement is that there will be no more tax rises and no more increases in government spending, instead a scalpel is set to be taken to some departments. This is the opposite of what she did in the autumn and the opposite of what you'd assume Labour chancellors do. This more guarded approach is in part a response to the uncertainty created by the Trump administration - nobody knows quite what is around the corner.\n\nHow long are people willing to wait?\n\nBut she has been taking inspiration from across the Atlantic for many years. One of Reeves' first jobs was working as an economist at the British Embassy in Washington from 2002 to 2003. That era defined her early thinking and she's still gazing to America for inspiration \u2013 Reeves' first call as chancellor was to Janet Yellen, then her counterpart in DC as treasury secretary in president Joe Biden's administration. I ask Yellen for her advice to Reeves now, nearly a year on. She says to keep doing the difficult things: \"I think she [Reeves] should, you know, stick with the course that she set out and move things, move things forward with, you know, as much speed and commitment as she possibly can.\"\n\nGetty Images Rachel Reeves' first call as chancellor was to Janet Yellen\n\nBut there is tension in Reeves' approach. Labour is increasing tax, but squeezing some spending. Ministers are rolling back some rules and regulations, but giving workers more rights at work. In effect they are putting the brakes and the accelerator on at the same time. She is aware there is no one thing she can do to suddenly create prosperity. And so how long can people be expected to wait for the change they've been promised? Communication is key according to Yellen: \"Before you get improvements that are noticeable to voters in infrastructure and job creation, it does take time and so you don't get the immediate payoff. \"And so communication, I think, is very important to make the population understand that this is an approach that requires some patience to see the payoff. But truly, it's the only way, over the medium term, to boost living standards in major economies.\"\n\nReeves: 'The world has changed'\n\nReeves is asking voters to believe that some of the tough choices she is making can be explained, at least in part, by the fact that the world around her has changed in a way she hadn't anticipated when her party was beginning to prepare its new offer to the public in the aftermath of Labour's 2019 election defeat. First, a massive \u00a328bn borrowing that had been earmarked to spend on green projects was binned, a necessary response to the economic turmoil under Liz Truss according to Labour - not a view shared by opponents who never thought Labour's policy credible. Whereas once she said she would be the first green chancellor, now Reeves is signing off airport expansion at Heathrow, proposing to get rid of regulations, and ousting the regulator at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nGetty Images Uncertainty over Donald Trump's willingness to support Ukraine has seen the UK commit more money to defence\n\nLabour argues the country's economic books were worse than expected when they took power. And much more recently, uncertainty over Donald Trump's willingness to support Ukraine and Nato more widely has seen the UK commit more money to defence. \"The world has changed, [we] can see it before our eyes, in a whole number of respects,\" Reeves tells me. \"[We are seeing] greater instability and insecurity in the world, Europe having to take on a bigger role in our continent for our own defence.\"\n\nWhat kind of Labour politician Reeves is\n\nBut to some, Reeves' willingness to change course raises the question as to what kind of Labour politician she is. The cuts to welfare are at the heart of this. At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir declared that welfare reform was a \"moral issue\", while the veteran left-wing MP Diane Abbott argued there was \"nothing moral about cutting the benefits of millions of people\". Reeves sat out much of Labour's doomed period with Jeremy Corbyn as leader. She was always serious, watchful, with an eye on her party's and her own future. When she became shadow chancellor she put enormous efforts into schmoozing the city, even if she did once confess she'd instruct her team to sweep up any left over pastries at the end of their business breakfasts.\n\nGetty Images Reeves: 'One of the things I think that I find hard, even with the thicker skin I guess I must have developed... is some of the personal criticism'\n\nReeves sees herself as a pragmatic politician, not an ideologue, whether that means increasing taxes in her first budget to fund public services or conversely cutting benefits in this week's statement. Deborah Mattinson was Sir Keir's director of strategy up until the election. She argues Reeves is canny and it is her values that make her Labour. \"She is very, very savvy. She's good at looking around corners. \"It's a cliche to say she's a chess player, but actually it is true that she's not somebody who deals with the problem that's right in front of her and leaves it there. She's somebody who is able to look several moves ahead and always has that slightly longer-term focus.\"\n\nLabour and the economy: a trust problem\n\nReeves would tell you her politics were made at home, her values that of the south London girl who worked hard and made it to the Bank of England, her economics crafted by study and experience but also the requirements of getting elected \u2013 remember she chose politics not economics after all. That, according to Deborah Mattison is key. The decisions Reeves takes are based squarely on ensuring Labour is viewed as economically credible. The argument is that if it isn't seen as sufficiently credible it won't be in power and then nothing else really matters. \"You can't win an election if you're not trusted to run the economy. And Labour has a historical problem that goes back a very, very long way,\" she tells me. \"After [the election defeat] in 2010, that all dissipated\u2026 [and] the Corbyn years, really, really were problematic. So that's the situation that she inherited and we were no further forward by the time she was appointed shadow chancellor. \"By the time we went into the election, she had a double-digit lead over her Tory opposite number. That is one hell of an achievement.\"\n\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\n\nLike her predecessors in New Labour, Reeves takes the view that the public is less interested in Labour's economic ideology and more interested in delivering economic prosperity. (Her opponents on the left of the party would argue a clear ideological stance and economic success are not mutually exclusive). However there is one clear division between Reeves and Gordon Brown, chancellor between 1997-2007. Whereas Brown made little secret of his craving to be prime minister, Reeves says she doesn't have the same goal.\n\nGetty Images Gordon Brown was chancellor between 1997 and 2007\n\n\"I honestly have no desire whatsoever to do that job. That's not always the answer you might get from chancellor of the exchequer, but in my case, it's absolutely true. The job I've always wanted is this one. \"And I'm very, very lucky because there aren't many people in politics or in other walks of life that manage to do the job that they've always dreamed of perhaps. And for me, I'm doing that today in this job.\" But make no mistake, next week's Spring Statement is the stuff of nightmares for a Labour chancellor. Her party will hate the cuts to welfare. And at the same time, borrowing and unemployment are ticking up and there is no sign of the economy budging, even though getting it to grow is Labour's number one mission. Rachel Reeves is the architect and face of her government's economic plans. If she is indeed feeling the heat, perhaps it's little surprise. The Making of a Chancellor is on BBC Sounds from Saturday 00:01and on BBC Radio 4 on Monday at 16:00 and Tuesday at 09:30 Additional reporting: Jake Morris. Top picture credit: Getty Images",

    "body": "TikTok investigated over use of children's data\n\n3 March 2025 Share Save Tom Gerken Technology reporter Share Save\n\nPA Media\n\nThe UK data watchdog has launched what it calls a \"major investigation\" into TikTok's use of children's personal information. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) will inspect the way in which the social media platform uses the data of 13 to 17-year-olds to recommend further content to them. John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, said it would look at whether TikTok's data collection practices could lead to children experiencing harms, such as data being leaked or spending \"more time than is healthy\" on the platform. TikTok told the BBC its recommender systems operated under \"strict and comprehensive measures that protect the privacy and safety of teens\".\n\nIt added that the platform also has \"robust restrictions on the content allowed in teens' feeds\". Mr Edwards said TikTok's algorithm \"feeds\" on personal data gleaned from user profiles, preferences, links clicked and how long they spend watching a particular video - making it subject to UK rules. In addition to the probe into TikTok, the ICO is also checking the age verification processes of Reddit and Imgur, an image-sharing platform. The investigation will look into whether the companies are complying with both the UK's data protection laws, and the children's code. The code is set to design principles for online platforms aimed at protecting children in the UK. Platforms which collect UK children's user data must minimise the amount they gather and take extra care when processing it.\n\nReddit and Imgur probes\n\nThe ICO's investigations into Reddit and Imgur will focus on how the platforms check the ages of their users and their enforcement of age checks. Ofcom said in October Reddit had overtaken X as the UK's fifth most popular platform. Imgur, meanwhile, says on its website that it reaches more than 250 million people a month. However, it does not state in which countries their users are based, so there is no figure for the number of people using it in the UK. \"I don't want to pre-judge how we might look at the Imgur and Reddit matters, but if there are age limits for accessing services, then the platforms have to enforce those in some ways,\" the Information Commissioner told the BBC. \"There are a number of different technologies and techniques that are available, I would say, and the degree of rigor, I think, depends in part upon the kinds of risks, the likelihood that children will be accessing those sites. \"I guess a baseline would be: self-declaration is probably not going to cut it if there is content on the site or services on the site that are unsuitable for children under the age of 13.\" A Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that 95% of their users are adults but that they \"have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance\". Imgur has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment.\n\nNext steps",

    "title": "DR Congo conflict: SADC troops to pull out as M23 rebels gain ground",
    "body": "Southern African forces to leave DR Congo as rebels gain ground\n\n13 March 2025 Share Save Danai Nesta Kupemba in London and Shingai Nyoka in Harare BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images At least 14 South African troops have been killed in the fighting in DR Congo\n\nSouthern African leaders have announced they will pull their troops out of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where they have been helping the government fight rebel forces. The troops were sent two years ago to support the Congolese army fight the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels, which has seized control of large parts of mineral-rich eastern DR Congo this year. At least 19 soldiers from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania were killed when the M23 captured the region's biggest city, Goma, in January. Thousands of people have been killed during the fighting and hundreds of thousands left without shelter after fleeing their homes.\n\nThere have been concerns the fighting could escalate to a wider regional conflict. The M23 has continued to gain ground in eastern DR Congo and last month seized the region's second-biggest city, Bukavu. South Africa's deployment was heavily criticised by the public and opposition following the killing of its soldiers. Announcing the withdrawal, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the \"situation is precarious, but the peace as it is now is holding\". However, the M23 has continued to seize more territory this week. Sandile Swanda, a South African political analyst, told the BBC it was an \"embarrassing\" situation for her country. \"The rebels are very strong. This is a full-on war and South Africa is hardly ready for any such war,\" he said. He added: \"No country in the Sadc region is ready for this war - psychologically, militarily and politically.\" But the withdrawal is not just a setback for South Africa, it's a blow to both Sadc and the DR Congo, analysts say. Stephanie Wolters, a senior research fellow at the South African Institute of International Affairs, told the BBC that Sadc's withdrawal weakens Kinshasa's position. \"They [Sadc] have gone from being on Kinshasa's side to being at best in a neutral position,\" she said. In February, Malawi's president said its troops would be withdrawn from DR Congo, although he didn't give a reason.\n\nThe decision to start a \"phased withdrawal\" from DR Congo was made during a virtual summit of the 16-member Southern African Development Community (Sadc) in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, on Thursday. No reason was given. The Sadc leaders said that even though the troops would be withdrawn from DR Congo, the bloc would continue to \"support interventions aimed at bringing lasting peace\". Sadc also called for a diplomatic and political solution to the conflict. Previous efforts to bring peace to DR Congo have not been successful. But Angola has announced this week that it will host peace talks between DR Congo and the M23 next week in the capital, Luanda. The M23 said they \"welcomed\" this move. DR Congo's President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi has previously refused to engage in direct negotiations with the group, insisting on only talking to Rwanda. This was Sadc's third emergency summit on DR Congo in recent months. It is unclear how many Sadc troops are in DR Congo, but 5,000 troops were due to be sent. South Africa, which leads the mission, was to deploy 2,900 troops and the rest shared between Malawi and Tanzania.\n\nFind out more about the conflict in DR Congo:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

    "body": "Olivia Rodrigo and The 1975 to headline Glastonbury\n\n6 March 2025 Share Save Mark Savage Music Correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images Olivia Rodrigo will become the second-youngest act to headline the Pyramid Stage\n\nUS pop star Olivia Rodrigo and British band The 1975 will headline the Glastonbury festival this summer, organisers have announced. They will be joined by five-time Brit Award winner Charli XCX - who will top the bill on the festival's second stage on Saturday 28 June. There will also be debut Glastonbury performances by Alanis Morisette, Noah Kahan, Gracie Abrams, Lola Young and US rap phenomenon Doechii, who will headline the West Holts stage. Returning favourites include Wolf Alice, Wet Leg, Fatboy Slim, Loyle Carner and Scissor Sisters. Rock legend Neil Young has already been announced as the Saturday night headliner, with Rod Stewart playing the Sunday afternoon \"legend slot\".\n\nThe 1975 reach top of the bill\n\nPA Media The 1975 have played Glastonbury several times, but this will be their first headline appearance\n\nCheshire's The 1975 are festival veterans, who have headlined the Reading and Leeds festival three times since 2016 - but this will be their first time at the top of Glastonbury's line-up. Balancing hooky dance-rock with more experimental forays into electronica and even ambient music, they pepper their lyrics with references to online relationships, chemical dependency and wry, self-aware humour. Frontman Matty Healy is known for his provocative, and often divisive, actions. On their recent tour, he has been spotted chewing raw steak, berating security guards via Auto-Tune, and passionately kissing fans in the front row. More seriously, the band are being sued by organisers of a Malaysian festival, which was shut down after Healy kissed one of his bandmates on stage. The singer said he was protesting at the country's anti-LGBT laws, under which homosexual acts can be punished by 20 years in prison. \"I feel like they'll be great headliners,\" said BBC 6 Music's Nick Grimshaw, speaking on the Sidetracked podcast. \"They have great taste and great vision - and they're a band who will think about do a bespoke show.\"\n\nOlivia's rapid rise\n\nOlivia Rodrigo drew a huge audience for her Glastonbury debut in 2022\n\nRodrigo is the first Glastonbury headliner to have broken through in the 2020s - and the second-youngest solo headliner of all time, after Billie Eilish, who was 20 when she topped the bill in 2022. Like Eilish, the 22-year-old will play the Pyramid Stage with just two albums to her name, but she has a solid armoury of fist-pumping pop-punk singalongs (Good 4 U, Brutal, Get Him Back), alongside lighters-aloft ballads like Driver's License and Vampire. An accomplished live performer, her 2024 Guts tour banked $186m (\u00a3144m) in ticket sales; and she will also headline the BST festival in London's Hyde Park two days before Glastonbury. Rodrigo last played the festival in 2022, drawing a huge - and noticeably young - crowd to the Other Stage. During that performance, she brought out Lily Allen to perform the expletive-laden track F You, dedicating it to the US Supreme Court justices who had, a day earlier, ended the constitutional right to abortion in America.\n\nCharli's next Brat summer\n\nReuters Charli XCX will bring Brat to Worthy Farm\n\nRumours that Rihanna would play the Pyramid Stage turned out to be wishful thinking for the second year running. But Charli XCX will cement her position as one of the UK's biggest pop stars with her set on the Other Stage. She returns to the festival after winning five Brit Awards for her deliberately trashy seventh album, Brat. Playing the Other Stage will release her from the requirement to tone down her set for audiences on BBC One, and indulge in the frenetic, hedonistic club sounds that made her name. \"The Other Stage is traditionally more of a home for electronic music,\" said Annie Mac on Sidetracked. \"It makes so much sense for her to counteract the Neil Young set on Saturday night.\" Charli's set also marks the latest step in the star's journey through Glastonbury's smaller stages, starting at the Silver Hayes dance arena in 2014. \"I was really ill and I forgot to wear a bra on stage, which was good!\" she later told the BBC about her debut.. \"[Radio 1 DJ] Huw Stephens came on during the last song and told me I was singing live on the radio. I lost my voice and it was all a bit crazy, but it was fun.\" Hopefully she'll avoid the lurgy this summer.\n\nMore acts added\n\nGetty Images Rap pioneer Busta Rhymes will make his debut at the festival\n\nOther acts announced for Glastonbury 2025 include Ezra Collective, Jorja Smith, The Libertines, The Maccabees, Franz Ferdinand, Kae Tempest, Beabadoobee, Kneecap and The Prodigy. Pop star Raye will also play just before Neil Young on the Saturday night, following her breakthrough set at lunchtime on the Pyramid Stage just two years ago.\n\nGlastonbury Festival\n\nThe line-up so far includes: Friday 27 June The 1975\n\nLoyle Carner\n\nBiffy Clyro\n\nAlanis Morissette\n\nBusta Rhymes\n\nMaribou State\n\nGracie Abrams\n\nFour Tet\n\nWet Leg\n\nAnohni & The Johnsons\n\nBadbadnotgood\n\nBlossoms\n\nBurning Spear\n\nCmat\n\nDenzel Curry\n\nEn Vogue\n\nEnglish Teacher\n\nFatboy Slim\n\nFaye Webster\n\nFloating Points\n\nFranz Ferdinand\n\nGlass Beams\n\nInhaler\n\nLola Young\n\nMyles Smith\n\nOsees\n\nPinkpantheress\n\nSelf Esteem\n\nSupergrass\n\nVieux Farka Tour\u00e9\n\nWunderhorse Saturday 28 June Neil Young and the Chrome Hearts\n\nCharli XCX\n\nRaye\n\nDoechii\n\nDeftones\n\nEzra Collective\n\nJohn Fogerty\n\nAmyl & The Sniffers\n\nAmaarae\n\nBeabadoobee\n\nBeth Gibbons\n\nBob Vylan\n\nBrandi Carlile\n\nCaribou\n\nFather John Misty\n\nGary Numan\n\nGreentea Peng\n\nJade\n\nJapanese Breakfast\n\nKaiser Chiefs\n\nKneecap\n\nLeftfield\n\nLucy Dacus\n\nNick Lowe\n\nNova Twins\n\nPa Salieu\n\nScissor Sisters\n\nTom Odell\n\nThe Script\n\nTV On The Radio\n\nWeezer\n\nYussef Dayes Sunday 29 June Olivia Rodrigo\n\nRod Stewart\n\nThe Prodigy\n\nNoah Kahan\n\nNile Rodgers & Chic\n\nWolf Alice\n\nJorja Smith\n\nOvermono\n\nThe Libertines\n\nAJ Tracey\n\nBlack Uhuru\n\nCeleste\n\nCymande\n\nFuture Islands\n\nGirl In Red\n\nGoat\n\nJoy Crookes\n\nKae Tempest\n\nKaty J Pearson\n\nParcels\n\nPawsa\n\nRoyel Otis\n\nShaboozey\n\nSnow Patrol\n\nSprints\n\nSt Vincent\n\nThe Brian Jonestown Massacre\n\nThe Maccabees\n\nThe Selecter\n\nTurnstile More acts will be announced before the festival opens its gates on 25 June.",

    "body": "UK homes install subsidised heat pumps at record level\n\n6 March 2025 Share Save Esme Stallard Climate and science reporter, BBC News Becky Dale Data journalist, BBC Verify Share Save\n\nAndrew Aitchison/Getty Images\n\nThe number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year. Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023. Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers. But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.\n\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy. \"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"\n\nMost UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases. With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges. Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers. About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support. One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation. Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures. \"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said. In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget. Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive. \"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said. He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.\n\nDespite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028. But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year. \"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said. Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation. \"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said. This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.\n\nMs Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity. In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills. \"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said. Additional reporting by Justin Rowlatt.",

Work to demolish and remove an old bridge has seen the stretch between junction 10, near Wisley, and junction 11, near Woking, shut in both directions from 21:00 GMT on Friday until 05:30 on Monday. It is part of a \u00a3317m project to add extra lanes to improve safety and cut congestion where the motorway meets the A3. National Highways said that diversion routes will be in place while work is carried out and drivers are being urged to avoid the area unless their journey is \"absolutely necessary\".\n\nThe closure of the M25 at Wisley will be the last one for the works\n\nBegun in 2022, work was due to end this summer but that completion date has now been delayed until spring 2026 as a result of \"periods of extreme weather\". And, while National Highways admitted a \"notable increase\" in traffic during the previous closure a fortnight ago compared with the previous three in 2024, it said an end was in sight.\n\nSenior project manager Jonathan Wade insisted the \"complex\" project was now \"on the home straight\", even despite Friday's problems at Heathrow, where an electrical fire caused flight chaos and left thousands stranded. However, he added that, while National Highways are continuing as planned, the Department of Transport would have the final decision on the matter. Mr Wade also advised drivers to allow extra time and use alternative routes where possible. Motorists are also being warned to follow the official diversions put in place, after a HGV driver had to be rescued by Surrey Police from Pyrford Lock after following Google Maps instead.

The police watchdog said the officers had been served disciplinary notices over their alleged handling of a domestic abuse report by Harshita Brella. Detectives believe the 24-year-old was strangled by Pankaj Lamba, 23, in Corby, Northamptonshire, on the evening of 10 November. Her body was found in the boot of a silver Vauxhall Corsa about 100 miles away (160km) in Ilford, east London, four days later.\n\nProsecutors have authorised Mr Lamba to be charged with murder, two counts of rape, sexual assault and controlling or coercive behaviour. However, he is believed to have fled the UK.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police Pankaj Lamba had already been arrested after a report of domestic abuse made by Ms Brella\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it was gathering and reviewing evidence regarding the contact the force had had with the victim. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said two were served disciplinary notices \"at the level of gross misconduct\" and two for \"potential misconduct\". \"The gross misconduct notices on two detective constables cover alleged failings to progress inquiries and communicate with Ms Brella after her report of domestic abuse at the end of August 2024,\" he explained. \"The misconduct notices on two more senior officers relate to their supervision of the case and relevant risk assessments.\" The notices meant the officers were under investigation but would not necessarily mean disciplinary proceedings would follow. Mr Campbell continued: \"Our thoughts remain with Ms Brella's family and all those affected by her death. \"We have met Ms Brella's family to update them on our investigation.\"\n\nThe IOPC previously said Mr Lamba was arrested on 3 September, but was released on conditional bail and a domestic violence protection order was put in place. He was told to pay police \u00a3480 in costs and the order expired on 1 October. The charges being brought against Mr Lamba - who lived at Sturton Walk in Corby - were laid out at Northampton Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.\n\nThe couple entered an arranged marriage in August 2023 and moved to the UK in April 2024. Ms Brella's mother, Sudesh Kumari, previously told the BBC from her home in Delhi that she wanted justice for her daughter. On Tuesday, police in India arrested Mr Lamba's parents on charges of causing Ms Brella's death by subjecting her to cruelty, following a complaint from her family.

    "title": "Bedfordshire MP wants \"major overhaul\" of daylight saving time",
    "body": "Why are MPs debating changes to daylight saving?\n\n28 March 2025 Share Save Amy Holmes BBC political reporter, Bedfordshire Share Save\n\nReuters A Bedfordshire MP wants a return to a system introduced in World War Two where clocks were advanced by two hours from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)\n\nFor many who dislike dark winter nights, this weekend will be one to savour as the clocks spring forward by an hour on Sunday 30 March from 01:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This marks the end for some and the gloom that can be caused by GMT, and the start of British Summer Time (BST) and lighter evenings. However, the Labour MP for Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard, Alex Mayer, has called for a \"major overhaul of time\" and a conversation about \"how best to use our nation's daylight hours\" in a parliamentary debate. But why do the clocks go back and forward in the UK each year?\n\nAlex Mayer Alex Mayer said a change could help the country meet climate goals, reduce energy bills and boost high streets\n\nThe process of moving the clocks forward by one hour in the summer was started during World War One in Germany in 1916, as a way to save energy resources during lighter evenings. Weeks later other countries followed suit, including the UK, where it was named British Summer Time. During World War Two in 1941, the then-prime minister Sir Winston Churchill introduced a system where clocks were advanced by two hours. This meant that during winter, while clocks went back an hour they were still one hour ahead of GMT to increase productivity during daylight. This ended in 1945, but briefly returned two years later due to severe fuel shortages that summer.\n\nWhat did the debate involve?\n\nAmy Holmes/BBC If the changes Alex Mayer MP wants were to happen, people in her constituency could enjoy views like this in Dunstable for longer in the evenings\n\nMayer wants a return to how things were in World War Two and hosted an adjournment debate in Parliament on the subject. She argued that a return to what is known as \"Churchill Time\" could help save a combined \u00a3485m in yearly electricity bills - and reduce carbon emissions by more than 400,000 tonnes. She called this \"a low-cost, high-impact proposal\" to \"help meet climate goals, reduce energy bills, and boost our High Streets by making better use of the daylight hours we already have\". Responding for the government, Business Minister Justin Madders said despite public debate about changing the clocks, the government was not going to introduce double summer time. Mayer is not the first MP to bring this discussion to Westminster. In 2012, a bid by Conservative MP Rebecca Harris to move UK clocks forward by an hour for a three-year trial period failed after the legislation ran out of time in the House of Commons. In 1968, there was a three-year experiment to keep BST in place throughout the year. On average, there was a huge reduction in road casualties, but this has since been attributed to new drink-driving legislation in 1967.\n\nWhat are the arguments against the change?\n\nGetty Images Tourists stand on the James Bradley's meridian line at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich\n\nDuring that experiment in northern Scotland, there was a net increase in the number of people killed or seriously injured on the roads, because during the darkest days of December sunrise would not take place until 10:00. In 2012, when MPs voted against it, many objections focused on the impact of a change on road accidents. Critics argued it would make the lives of outdoor workers harder and increase road accidents due to the darker mornings - although those in favour of a change argue it would reduce evening accidents. Other sources have expressed concerns about the negative impact of extended daylight evenings to health and sleep patterns. Recent studies suggested modern power consumption habits mean energy savings made by reducing evening lighting were now offset by increased energy consumption, in the warmer lighter evenings.\n\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

Amid the fall-out, Oasis issued a statement saying they had no \"awareness that dynamic pricing was going to be used\" in the sale of tickets for the initial dates. The CMA launched its investigation in September, to examine whether Ticketmaster had engaged in \"unfair commercial practices,\" and whether fans were pressured to buy tickets within a short period of time.

    "body": "Graduates turned down by supermarkets as vacancies drop\n\n28 April 2025 Share Save Kirsty Grant & Jennifer Meierhans BBC News reporters Share Save\n\nFaisa Ali Tarabi Faisa has been looking for work for 15 months\n\nYoung people have told the BBC they are finding it harder than ever to get a job, with some graduates frustrated at being turned down for roles at supermarkets. The government says getting more young people into work is a priority but UK job vacancies are at their lowest level in nearly four years. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents supermarkets, told the BBC young people would be hit hardest as firms cut back on hiring because of rising employer costs and forthcoming changes to workers' rights. Faisa Ali Tarabi, 24, from Bolton said she had gone through Aldi's recruitment process only to be told there was no suitable vacancy.\n\nShe has a degree in accounting and finance from the University of Salford and a masters in management from Manchester Metropolitan University Looking for work since she finished her masters in January 2024, she estimates she has applied for around 2,000 roles. \"I've been without work for 15 months now, and to be honest, I'm not just looking for work with my degrees now. I'm trying to get whatever I can for the time being.\" Faisa says she applied for a job at an Aldi warehouse in March 2024 but she showed the BBC an email from the store's recruitment team saying: \"You've done really well so far, however we do not currently have a vacancy that fully meets your requirements.\" It said \"all is not lost though\" and said recruiters would be back in touch if a potential vacancy came up in the next 12 months. She says she has not heard anything since. The BBC has asked Aldi for a comment.\n\nIn February we reported that more 16-24 year-olds were not in work, education or training at the end of 2024 than at any point in the past 11 years. That is 13.4%, or almost one out of every seven people in that age range, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Faisa was one of hundreds of people who commented on this report on BBC News TikTok saying their unemployment was not for want of trying. \"I check every day, there are no jobs,\" one user said. Another said: \"Finished my uni degree and can't find one job within the field I studied for.\" A third user posted: \"Young people aren't fussy we literally can't even get hired cleaning toilets.\"\n\nThe number of jobs on offer in the UK fell to 781,000 in the first three months of the year, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Some experts believe the rising cost of employing people is making businesses hold back on hiring new staff. In April the rate of employer National Insurance contributions (NICs) went up and so did minimum wages across different age groups. Business groups have also called for urgent changes to the forthcoming Employment Rights Bill over concerns it could hit hiring. Under the new law being scrutinised in the House of Lords on Tuesday, company bosses will be required to offer a zero-hours worker a guaranteed-hours contract based on the hours they clock up during a 12-week period. The biggest concern among retail HR directors is that this risks making it much harder to offer people part-time jobs, according to a BRC survey. It surveyed HR directors at 30 businesses, together employing 585,000 retail workers. Just over half said the law change would result in a reduction in staff numbers in their business, while 61% said the new law would reduce flexibility in job offerings.\n\nBRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: \"Almost 250,000 jobs have been lost in retail over the last five years and many major retailers have already announced further job cuts on the back of increased costs of employment which kicked in in April.\" She said part-time roles were down by 200,000 since 2017. \"These roles, which provide vital entry points into work for students, carers and returners, are set to be hardest hit,\" she said. \"In its current form the Employment Rights Bill could backfire, putting the brakes on hiring, or worse still, putting retail job numbers further into reverse.\"\n\nAmy Wilkes Amy says not hearing back about job applications can feel \"impossible\" but says you must not give up\n\nIn November we spoke to Amy Wilkes, 23, from Coventry who was struggling to find a job after getting a degree in criminology, policing and investigation. She says she applied for supermarket roles but did not get a response. \"It was feeling impossible,\" she says. \"What really hurt me was the not hearing back because you don't get any feedback to tell you where you're going wrong.\" After seven months Amy secured a job as a support worker, which she will start in July. \"It was a surreal moment when I found out. I was in absolute shock, quite emotional but very thrilled,\" she says. Her biggest piece of advice to others looking for work is \"don't give up\". \"I know it's really hard but there is a job out there for you,\" she says. \"Think about what you can offer - that helped my confidence to think about myself and knowing my value and what I could bring to a company.\"\n\nA government spokesperson said its new \"youth guarantee\" was \"providing every 18-21-year-old in England with access to an apprenticeship, quality training and education opportunities or help to find a job\". It said its decisions, including to raise employer NICs, were necessary to \"stabilise the public finances\" to fund services like the NHS.

    "body": "King and Queen have 'heavy hearts' after Pope's death\n\n21 April 2025 Share Save Adam Durbin BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nKing Charles has said he and Queen Camilla have \"heavy hearts\" after Pope Francis's death, as they paid tribute to his \"compassion\" and \"tireless commitment\" to people of faith. In a statement, the King said that though \"deeply saddened\", their sorrow had been \"somewhat eased\" by the Pope being able to share an Easter greeting with the world on Sunday, before he died aged 88. The King and Camilla met the pontiff on a state visit to Italy earlier this month, which the couple said they remembered with \"particular affection\". Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of Catholics in England and Wales, echoed the King's comments, saying the Pope's death \"brings great sadness to so many\".\n\nThe King and Queen's state visit to the Vatican in early April had been cancelled because of the Pope's poor health, but they managed to visit him privately during their trip to Italy. The meeting was arranged at the last minute and took place on 9 April - the King and Queen's 20th wedding anniversary - with the pontiff wishing them a happy anniversary. In his tribute, the King said: \"His Holiness will be remembered for his compassion, his concern for the unity of the Church and for his tireless commitment to the common causes of all people of faith, and to those of goodwill who work for the benefit of others. \"His belief that care for Creation is an existential expression of faith in God resounded with so many across the world. \"Through his work and care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many.\" He said he and the Queen \"remember with particular affection\" their meetings with the Pope over the years and \"were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month\".\n\n'Faith and hope'\n\nCardinal Vincent Nichols described the Pope as \"a voice proclaiming the innate dignity of every human being, especially those who are poor or marginalised\". At a mass at Westminster Cathedral on Monday evening, he said while there was a \"sadness of loss\", there remained a \"confidence of faith and hope\". \"His voice so often called us not to optimism, but to renewed effort to protect those who were without hope, who could see no way forward,\" he said. \"He was sharply critical of all who ignored the wellbeing of so many and held them to be of no significance in their calculations and actions.\" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, currently the most senior Church of England priest, described the Pope as a \"holy man of God\" who was \"also very human\". \"Francis's whole life and ministry was centred on Jesus who comes among us not to be served, but to serve,\" he added.\n\nGetty Images The King said he remembered meeting Pope Francis on several occasions - including the first in 2017 - with \"particular affection\"",

    "body": "Tariffs 'hard to come back from', says US pharma boss\n\n3 April 2025 Share Save Simon Jack Business editor Share Save\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images David Ricks said he was doubtful whether tariffs would succeed in bringing jobs and money to the US\n\nThe boss of US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly has told the BBC there is no looking back from Donald Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from the rest of the world. In an exclusive interview, David Ricks described it as a watershed moment in US economic history, \"I think it's a pivot in US policy and it feels like it'll be hard to come back from here.\" While Mr Ricks said he thought it may encourage some companies to relocate some manufacturing, he was doubtful it would also create hundreds of billions in additional revenue for the US promised by President Trump. He also added that the UK's status as a pharmaceutical and life sciences power was in decline.\n\nEli Lilly is a pharmaceutical giant based in Indianapolis worth $750bn (\u00a3573bn; \u20ac676bn) with 50,000 employees across the US, Europe and Asia. Due to their complex supply chains and the often life-saving products they make, pharmaceutical companies along with microchip makers were temporarily exempted from the tariffs imposed on all products imported into the US. But Mr Ricks seemed in little doubt that tariffs will eventually hit and that this will have damaging consequences for investment in new medicines. He explained drug prices were essentially capped in Europe and the US, which meant the impact of tariffs would be felt elsewhere. \"We can't breach those agreements so we have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade offs within our own companies,\" he said. \"Typically that will be in reduction of staff or research and development (R&D) and I predict R&D will come first. That's a disappointing outcome.\"\n\nMr Ricks said he did not support the imposition of tariffs but understood its intention and respected President Trump's political mandate. \"We don't support tariffs, to be clear. In pharma, about 70% of global R&D takes place in the United States. So we're creating the next generation of breakthroughs and cures. \"But the production is heavily weighted outside the US. And that's not unique to our industry. It happened with electronics and software and other things\". \"So I think what this administration is saying is we want both. We want the means of production and we want the research and development intellectual property generation.\" Eli Lilly are in the process of building a new additional $800m facility in Ireland, where they employ more than 3,000 people. Mr Ricks said that development would proceed.",

    "body": "Titanic scan reveals ground-breaking details of ship's final hours\n\n8 April 2025 Share Save Rebecca Morelle \u2022 @BBCMorelle Science Editor Alison Francis Senior Science Journalist Share Save\n\nAtlantic Productions/Magellan The digital scan shows the bow sitting upright on the sea floor\n\nA detailed analysis of a full-sized digital scan of the Titanic has revealed new insight into the doomed liner's final hours. The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster. The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on. And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.\n\nAtlantic Productions/Magellan The stern of the ship, which broke off from the bow, is heavily damaged\n\n\"Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,\" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst. The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection.\n\nThe wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots. More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.

    "title": "Lexi Wilband: Mum found guilty of killing baby by shaking her",
    "body": "Mum found guilty of killing baby by shaking her\n\n2 April 2025 Share Save Tess de la Mare BBC News, Gloucestershire Share Save\n\nFamily handout Lexi Wilband was just four months old when she was fatally shaken\n\nA woman has been found guilty of killing her baby by fatally shaking her. Melissa Wilband, 28, from Newent, was found guilty of the manslaughter of Lexi Wilband, who was four months old when she collapsed in her home in Newent, Gloucestershire in April 2020. Wilband's ex-partner, 31-year-old Jack Wheeler, was acquitted of causing or allowing the death of a child. The jury recorded their verdict after fewer than two days of deliberations.\n\nMr Wheeler, of Ledbury, Herefordshire, was previously charged with manslaughter - which he denied - but the charge was dropped during the trial. Tests revealed Lexi suffered bleeding on her brain, likely caused by being violently shaken, both recently and on at least one earlier occasion, prosecutors said. She died at Bristol Children's Hospital on 18 April, six days after her collapse. Mr Wheeler, who was not Lexi's biological father, said in court she went floppy in his arms and stopped breathing.\n\nGloucestershire Police Melissa Wilband has been found guilty of the manslaughter of her four-month-old daughter\n\nWilband was told she will be sentenced on 22 May and was granted bail until that date. She left the court in tears. During the trial, the jury heard Mr Wheeler had been in a relationship with Wilband for about three years. They had a volatile relationship and were regular cocaine users, the jury were told. Lexi had been conceived early in 2019 while the couple were on a break. Wilband faked a DNA test during the pregnancy to try to convince Mr Wheeler he was the father.\n\nWilband presented Mr Wheeler with a document, which purported to be a paternity test, declaring he was the father but it contained obvious errors. The word \"father\" was spelt \"farther\". However, when Lexi was born on 30 November 2019, a genuine DNA test revealed Mr Wheeler was not biologically related to her.\n\nMr Wheeler was cleared of causing or allowing Lexi's death\n\nOn 12 April, the night of Lexi's collapse, neighbours heard a woman crying inside the house and a man talking at about 23:30 BST. A woman was heard saying words to the effect of \"what are we going to do now?\". Wilband did not immediately call 999 but instead called the non-emergency NHS 111 number. She hung up before getting past the automated messages and then called her father who told her to dial 999. But she called 111 again and it took three-and-a-half minutes before she was connected to emergency services at 23:24. Paramedics sent to the property found Lexi on the floor. Wilband told a paediatric doctor Mr Wheeler had carried Lexi upstairs in her bouncer chair and may have hit her head in the process.\n\nWilband then told a ward sister Mr Wheeler had been \"swinging the baby bouncer\" while Lexi was inside it. Both Wilband and Mr Wheeler were present when a decision was made to turn off Lexi's ventilator on 17 April 2020, following the results of an MRI exam. The jury heard Wilband was by her daughter's side between 20:00 and 23:00 that night but then went to sleep in another part of the hospital, despite knowing her daughter might die. A staff nurse remained with Lexi and held her hand through the night. Nurses noticed Lexi seemed to have longer pauses in her breathing on the morning of 18 April and told Wilband to attend the ward. She arrived just after Lexi died.\n\n'Lie after lie'\n\nMessages sent by Wilband to her partner telling him to lie about what had happened were recovered from Mr Wheeler's phone. Wilband also told Wheeler to burn drugs bags that were in her bedside drawer so they could not be found by police. Det Insp Adam Stacey, from Gloucestershire Police, said: \"Wilband told lie after lie after lie - right from Lexi's conception, and all the way throughout the pregnancy. \"These lies continued and were made to medical professionals trying to save Lexi's life, to the police, and all the way through to her giving evidence in court.\n\n\"The jury saw those lies for what they were. \"Lexi should be five years old now with her whole future ahead of her. \"She was shaken by someone who should have been protecting her. Someone who should have put her safety and wellbeing above everything else, her mother. \"Wilband did not do those things and in fact did the exact opposite. She now faces the consequences of her actions.\"",

    "body": "Jenrick adds hundreds to WhatsApp group in mix-up\n\n17 April 2025 Share Save Joshua Nevett Political reporter Share Save\n\nPA Media\n\nHundreds of Westminster insiders were added to - and then swiftly deleted from - a WhatsApp group set up by shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick to promote his London Marathon run. The mishap was laughed off by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who revealed that she too had briefly been a member of the chat along with senior journalists, former cabinet members and other Tory MPs. The BBC has been told Jenrick is not referring himself to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which investigates data breaches. A source said the ICO did not need to be involved because the contacts had been added to the group for \"personal purposes\" and the risk of malicious use was low.\n\nThe ICO told BBC News that data protection law did not apply to the use of personal information for \"domestic and household\" purposes. But it said if \"non-corporate communication channels\" - such as WhatsApp groups - were being used for \"professional purposes\", data protection law would apply. A source said Jenrick had announced he was running in the London Marathon and \"in a technical mix-up, a message designed for broadcast turned into a group chat\". All of the contacts - which are believed to include former cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Therese Coffey among others - have been removed from the group and the chat has been deleted. When asked if she had been added to the group chat, Badenoch laughed before replying: \"Yes and then no, I think is the correct answer to that.\" \"I think he's running a marathon,\" Badenoch added. \"I don't really understand yet what happened with the WhatsApp group.\" The BBC understands Jenrick's intention was to send messages about his marathon run individually to friends and colleagues in Westminster, in an attempt to raise money for charity. In a post on X, Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf said Jenrick had appeared to add \"his entire contact book\" to the group chat. \"He's now spending his morning deleting hundreds of them,\" Yusuf posted. In reply to that post, Jenrick wrote: \"Feeling left out again, Zia?\" Jenrick said he was running the London Marathon for SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity, adding he was \"rallying support for the cause\".\n\nThe Conservatives said they had consulted their data protection officer Andy Steadman, who had said this was not a party issue. \"This is nothing to do with the party, its a personal thing for Robert running a marathon,\" a Conservative spokesperson said. The BBC has seen screenshots of some of the messages in the group chat. In one message, a member posted \"RJ for PM\". Badenoch was asked if Jenrick, who previously ran against her for the Conservative Party leadership, now poses a fresh threat to her. She said: \"I have a great team and I'm leading a team that is uniting the Conservative Party. \"And what we're really focused on now is ensuring that people understand that voting Conservative at the local elections is the only credible option\".",

Speaking at the launch of his Virgin Group's hotel in Shoreditch, east London, the entrepreneur said that the world of business would \"have to deal with... the complete uncertainty\" of the impact of the US president's tariffs. The 74-year-old also told the BBC that he wanted to \"make London prosperous for everybody\" following the UK's decision to leave the EU. Sir Richard said: \"I still think it's a good time to start in the UK and... if we businesspeople can generate enough income for the UK, then taxes will start going down for people.\"\n\nSir Richard told BBC London he thought Trump \"got a nasty shock\"\n\nHe told the BBC that, more than 50 years after launching Virgin Records in London, the UK remained \"really special\" and was \"one of the few countries in the world that is stable\".

    "body": "Birmingham bin strike to continue as deal rejected\n\n14 April 2025 Share Save Aida Fofana BBC News, West Midlands Rob Mayor BBC Political Reporter, Birmingham Share Save\n\nEPA The council declared a major incident at the end of last month (file photo from 3 April)\n\nA strike by bin workers in Birmingham is set to continue after the latest pay offer by the city council was \"overwhelmingly\" rejected. It follows a month-long stand-off between members of the Unite union and the Labour-run authority as bin bags and fly-tipped rubbish have piled high on streets. Unite said the city council's \"partial\" offer was \"totally inadequate\" and did not address the potential pay cuts for 200 drivers. The council has previously said the offer on the table was a fair one.\n\nUnite's national lead officer Onay Kasab said 97% of those who voted rejected the council's deal, on a 60% turnout. \"They could see through what this so-called proposal meant, it simply failed to deal with all of the issues and it also nailed the lie,\" he said. The union's general secretary Sharon Graham said the rejection was \"no surprise as these workers simply cannot afford to take pay cuts of this magnitude to pay the price for bad decision after bad decision\".\n\nUnite's national lead officer Onay Kasab the latest deal had been rejected by 97% of those who voted\n\nThe dispute centres around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles. The union argued that it was an important health and safety role and about 170 affected workers faced losing up to \u00a38,000 annually due to the decision, with hundreds more losing out on the prospect of pay progression. A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said the vote was \"incredibly disappointing\" but the authority's \"door remains open\". They claimed Unite's proposals focused on retaining a role that did not exist at other councils and could open up the council to more equal pay claims as refuse collection is a job overwhelmingly performed by men. The statement said a \"fair and reasonable offer\" was made while suggesting \"every employee affected by the removal of the WRCO role could take an equivalent graded role in the council, LGV Driver training or voluntary redundancy packages.\"\n\nSpeaking last week, councillors said with those deals in place no worker \"need lose a penny\". However, on Monday, Mr Kasab said the result of the ballot was proof that the dispute was more than \"simply about 17 workers\" - a number previously quoted by the council. He said: \"This is about huge pay cuts and hundreds of people, it's time now for us all to sit down, no more negative briefing, and let's reach a negotiated resolution and solution.\" One refuse collector told the BBC on Monday that the mood among their colleagues was \"powerful\", while another said their sentiments remained unchanged. \"As much as we want a resolution, none of us are willing to lose money,\" they added.\n\nSadia Khan, from the Friends of Spark Green Park, said there was a \"limit to how long this can go on\"\n\nLocal government minister Jim McMahon said the \"deeply disappointing\" result of the ballot would further add to the weeks of disruption. \"The huge effort to clear the backlog has already seen over 11,000 tonnes of waste collected, and will now continue at pace to protect public health while the dispute remains ongoing,\" he said. At the end of March, the council declared a major incident, saying that some 17,000 tonnes of rubbish was lining the city's streets. Some residents have also reported an increase in rats and other vermin. Adam Yasin said his Mercedes had been \"completely written off\" just weeks ago because rats had chewed through electrical wires. The 33-year-old, from Balsall Heath, said: \"Because of that certain wiring, the car wouldn't start. \"They said they need to rewire the whole car but the insurance company said it was too expensive. \"It has been really bad, especially where I live, there are a lot of restaurants there.\"\n\nReuters Other councils, including those in Lichfield and Telford, have offered assistance to clean up the streets\n\nIn recent days, military planners have been called in to help deal with the situation. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said that was not about \"boots on the ground\" but it would help get waste cleared. Other neighbouring authorities have also stepped in to help clear rubbish. \"We've got over two-thirds of the rubbish cleared off the streets now, this week we'll start to see cleaning up the pavements and streets as well as the clearance of all of that rubbish, I'm very pleased about that,\" Rayner said. \"The kids are off school - obviously it's Easter holidays, we want that rubbish cleared.\"\n\nPublic health\n\nSadia Khan, the chairperson of Friends of Spark Green Park, said while she sympathised with those on strike, \"rejecting another offer is just going to make the whole population a lot sicker\". She said dead cats had been found in parks and that she suspected it was due to them eating rat poison left out to reduce the growing problem of vermin. \"I know it's a financial crisis people are struggling to manage, and everyone deserves a better wage, but there's a limit to how long this can go on,\" she said. \"How much can you can risk the health of a population? Over a million people will be very, very impacted by things if it carries on.\" Last week, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said he was very concerned by the public health situation in Birmingham.\n\nThe council has come under fire for sending out leaflets about changes to recycling in the middle of the strike\n\nThe local authority is facing criticism, meanwhile, for pressing ahead with plans to switch from weekly to fortnightly collections while the strike remains unresolved. Leaflets about the change have appeared in residents' letter boxes, but Martin Mullaney, a former councillor for the city's Moseley and Kings Heath ward, said the timing was \"politically insensitive\". The leaflets state residents will have a new green recycling bin to be collected fortnightly, a food bin to be collected weekly, and a black bin to be collected fortnightly on alternate weeks to recycling collections. Although an all-out strike began on 11 March, there have been a series of on-off walkouts since January and some residents have told the BBC they have not had recycling collected in 2025.",

    "body": "Doctor barred 11 years after sex assault on teen\n\n10 April 2025 Share Save David Spereall BBC News Yorkshire Share Save\n\nGetty Images Dr Amitabh Kumar was initially suspended from practice in 2014 after the incident\n\nA doctor who sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl on a bus has been struck off the medical register, 11 years after the incident happened. Amitabh Kumar was initially suspended from practice after he touched the teenage passenger's neck and hair and rubbed her leg with his foot. Kumar, from Bradford, pleaded guilty to the offence at a magistrates' court in 2014 and received a community order. A series of subsequent tribunals barred him from practising medicine for a time-limited period.\n\nHowever, a new review has now disqualified him indefinitely after Kumar wrote a letter to the Medical Practitioners Tribunals Service (MPTS) in which he criticised his victim and claimed he was wrongly arrested. The MPTS hearing was told that Kumar, who did not attend, had written he was a \"victim of corrupt police and CPS systems\" and referred to the Post Office Horizon scandal which saw hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongly convicted.\n\n'Deteriorating insight'\n\nA General Medical Council (GMC) representative described the tone of Kumar's letter as \"worrying\" as it suggested the insight into his offence was \"deteriorating, instead of developing\". The MPTS ruling described how, in 2016, Kumar had claimed he could not remember the incident. The following year he was described as having demonstrated \"exceptional insight\" and that it was said he \"now understood the gravity of the offence\". By September 2019, a tribunal ruled that Kumar's fitness to work in the profession was \"no longer impaired\" by his conviction, but that he needed to refresh his clinical skills, having not practised for nine years. On that occasion, his suspension was extended by a year to give him a chance to improve, but subsequent reviews in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 found that there had been no change in these circumstances. Making its conclusion following the latest tribunal, the panel said: \"Dr Kumar has had many years to address the concerns regarding his practice and has persistently failed to do so. The ruling added that the panel \"took the view that Dr Kumar has now disengaged with the hearing process and is therefore unlikely to endeavour to remediate the concerns regarding his practice\".

    "body": "Discord's face scanning age checks 'start of a bigger shift'\n\n17 April 2025 Share Save Imran Rahman-Jones & Chris Vallance Technology reporters Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nDiscord is testing face scanning to verify some users' ages in the UK and Australia. The social platform, which says it has over 200 million monthly users around the world, was initially used by gamers but now has communities on a wide range of topics including pornography. The UK's online safety laws mean platforms with adult content will need to have \"robust\" age verification in place by July. And social media expert Matt Navarra told the BBC \"this isn't a one-off - it's the start of a bigger shift\". \"Regulators want real proof, and facial recognition might be the fastest route there,\" he said.\n\nBut campaigners have said these types of checks are ineffective and could lead to privacy issues. \"Age assurance is becoming the new seatbelt for the internet,\" said Mr Navarra. \"Will it become the norm in the UK? Honestly, yes, probably.\" He said he believed the incoming changes in online safety laws mean online platforms would beef up their age verification processes. \"The era of 'click here to confirm you're 13' is dead,\" he said. \"Get age verification wrong now, and you don't just lose users - you could lose a courtroom battle or incur fines.\" Firms which do not comply with the Online Safety Act could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover. Instagram previously brought in age checks using facial analysis in 2022 for users who want to change their profile settings to be over 18. The social media company requires users to take a selfie video on their phone and uses AI to estimate the person's age. Like Discord, they can alternatively upload a picture of their photo ID.\n\nThe US-based platform says the verification - which it describes as \"an experiment\" - will be a one-time check. It will apply the first time a user comes across content which it has flagged as sensitive, or if they change their settings on viewing sensitive media. Users can either use the face scanner or upload a photo of their ID to confirm their age. It says information used for age checks will not be stored by Discord or the verification company. Face scans will stay on the device and not be collected, and ID uploads will be deleted after the verification is complete, according to the company. Content which is flagged as sensitive is already automatically blocked or blurred for teenagers.\n\n'No silver bullet'",

    "body": "'Victory for women' and 'equality policies in chaos'\n\n17 April 2025 Share Save Share Save\n\nPA Media Many front pages carry a photo of the two co-directors of For Women Scotland - who brought the case - smiling broadly, with their hands in the air\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling that women are defined by their biological sex dominates the front pages. \"Trans women are not women\" is the Daily Telegraph's headline as it says access to single-sex NHS wards is likely to change. The Daily Mail hails the ruling as a \"victory...for common sense\". The Times says equality policies are now \"in chaos\", reporting that every organisation in England, Scotland and Wales - from hospitals to prisons and businesses - will have to review their policies. For the Daily Express author JK Rowling praises the \"extraordinary women\" that won the legal battle in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Guardian notes that trans women still have equal pay rights as women, and could have the right to be treated as women in some situations. It says campaigners are urging trans people to remain calm.

The discovery from scientists at the University of Cambridge that there are signs of life on a distant planet makes the front page of the Sun. The paper quotes a professor who is part of the team who detected traces of a molecule which is produced by plankton on Earth as saying that, \"there is no mechanism that can explain what we are seeing, without life\". The lead in the Daily Mirror is what the paper describes as the \"extraordinary gesture\" by the mother of Jean Charles de Menezes - who says that she has forgiven the police who shot her innocent son 20 years ago after what it said was a \"botched terror operation\" at Stockwell underground station. In an interview with the paper Maria de Menezes - who is now 80 - told the Mirror she did not want her final years to be \"destroyed by hatred\". The Metropolitan police said the shooting was a \"matter of deep regret\".

He first thought about getting checked for the disease after watching an episode of the Grand Tour - the car programme presented by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. The 52-year-old is now set to run an ultra-marathon ending at the Oxfordshire farm owned by Clarkson - who Mr Hood hails for \"saving my life\".\n\n\"I'd been watching an episode of the Grand Tour with one of my sons, and they [Clarkson, Hammond and May] were seeing whether they could drive their cars faster on a lap, having drunk three pints of water and desperately needing the toilet,\" Mr Hood told the BBC. A few days later, Mr Hood said his thoughts returned to the episode whilst in the shower. \"They'd had a little joke during that section around getting up in the middle of the night and needing to go to [the toilet].\"\n\nPA Media An episode of the Grand Tour led to Mr Hood getting checked for cancer\n\nHe said the jokes made him begin to think about prostate and testicular cancers. \"I thought, 'well, I'm 48-years-old (at the time) and I'd never checked myself, maybe I should'.\" \"I'm glad I did because it resulted in me finding out I had cancer. \"I cannot thank the episode of the Grand Tour enough for prompting me - it was that that prompted me to do it [get checked].\" Mr Hood, who is a keen runner, underwent chemotherapy and surgery during his recovery. He said he made the decision to \"rebuild stronger\" and \"comeback as Andy version 2.0\" whilst undergoing treatment.\n\nPA Media Mr Hood's run will end at Diddly Squat Farm Shop in Oxfordshire\n\nNow fully recovered, Mr Hood is set to run 35 miles (56km) from Oxford Train Station to Diddly Squat Farm - the focus of the hit-programme Clarkson's Farm. On the way, Mr Hood plans to stop at Clarkson's pub The Farmer's Dog, and the Hawk Stone - a Neolithic stone in the Oxfordshire countryside that gives its name to the former Top Gear presenter's beer brand. \"Whether he [Clarkson] is there or not, I will say, 'thank you',\" Mr Hood said. \"If just one person sees this run and says, 'do you know what, maybe I should check myself, maybe I should get this into my monthly routine', then every step of those 35 miles I will take running from Oxford to Squat will be absolutely worth it.\"",

    "body": "Pilots, parties, and pranks: Filming Top Gun with Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise\n\n4 April 2025 Share Save Ian Youngs & Paul Glynn Culture reporter Share Save\n\nParamount/Kobal/Shutterstock Val Kilmer (left) and Tom Cruise were sparring partners on screen and off in classic 1986 film Top Gun\n\nVal Kilmer is joking around in his trailer on the set of Top Gun, pretending to bark demands into a packet of More cigarettes as if it's a phone and he's talking to the studio boss. \"He wants more! More sex! More drugs! More wine! More tobacco! More headaches! More ulcers! More herpes! More women! And less of Tom Cruise!\" Co-stars Rick Rossovich and Barry Tubb, also on a break from playing the film's elite fighter pilots, are in the trailer too, cracking up with laughter. Rossovich, aka Kilmer's on-screen partner Slider, is apparently the person who wants \"more\". Wearing shades but no shirt, he proceeds to pretend to throw a chair at Kilmer's head, before jumping out of the trailer into the sunshine and dancing off.\n\nParamount/Kobal/Shutterstock Rick Rossovich (left) and Val Kilmer filming a scene in Top Gun\n\nKilmer took his video camera everywhere to film behind the scenes, and picked these snapshots of the carefree tomfoolery on the Top Gun set in 1985 as the opening shots for a 2021 documentary about his life. \"He had the first video camera I'd ever seen,\" recalls Tubb, who played Wolfman. \"They got so tired of telling him to turn it off on the set of Top Gun that they finally just let it go. \"We had a fun time with it because we tried to catch everyone on the toilet with the video camera. That was our goofing around. So there's video somewhere of everyone with the door open on the toilet. We were goofballs.\" He adds: \"Cruise never hung out with us. It was all of us, except for Cruise. He was method acting as the loner, and we were all at this beach hotel, riding motorcycles down hallways and things.\" And Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, \"unlike some producers, threw parties every other night\", he says. \"And so it was definitely in the air.\"\n\n'Young and bulletproof'\n\nTubb is one of many former co-stars who have been fondly remembering Kilmer's acting and his antics, following his death at the age of 65. \"He was the coolest cat I've ever met,\" Tubb tells BBC News. \"Not only did he have great acting chops, but he was funny as hell.\" Top Gun was a breakthrough for Kilmer, who played Iceman, the rival to Cruise's hotshot Maverick at the US Navy's academy for elite fighter pilots. On screen, saving the USA from Soviet MiG jets was serious business. Off screen, filming in California and Nevada, things were less serious. \"As Sean Penn once said, working in Hollywood is like being in high school with money,\" Tubb says. \"I was 22 years old, and I was the younger of the bunch. \"We had a deal that if one of us wanted to go to Mexico, all of us had to go. And Val had his van from high school, so we would all pile into Val's van and go over to Mexico for dinner. \"We were young and bulletproof.\"\n\nTubb whispered one of the film's famous lines when the class watched a video of aerial dogfights: \"This gives me a hard-on.\" That came about after he played a practical joke by switching the real tape in the academy's VHS player for a pornographic video. \"[Director] Tony Scott heard me say that and he said, 'Keep that in'. We were doing things like that. We were cutting up and having fun the whole time.\"\n\n'Play up the rivalry with Tom'\n\nKilmer originally didn't want to appear in the film, saying he throught the script was silly and he disliked its warmongering. To the audition, he \"wore oversize gonky Australian shorts in nausea green\" in an attempt to put the producers off, he wrote in his autobiography. \"I read the lines indifferently. And yet, amazingly, I was told I had the part.\" The script contained \"very little\" substance to Iceman's character, he said in his documentary. \"So I attempted to make him real. I manifested a backstory for him, where he had a father who ignored him, and as a result, was driven by the need to be perfect in every way. This obsession with perfection is what made him so arrogant.\"\n\nGetty Images The pair's rivalry was a key component of the film's plot\n\nHe added that he would \"purposely play up the rivalry between Tom's character and mine off screen\" as well as on. \"What ended up happening is the actors, in true method fashion, split into two distinct camps. \"You had Maverick and Goose on one side, and Slider, Hollywood, Wolfman and me, Iceman, on the other. \"It was fun to play up the conflict between our characters, but in reality I've always thought of Tom as a friend, and we've always supported each other.\" By the time a sequel was finally shot in 2018 and 2019, Kilmer had suffered from throat cancer. He had a tracheotomy operation, affecting his voice and making it difficult to speak. But Cruise was the one who insisted Iceman should return. The pair shared a highly emotional scene as Kilmer's character, now an admiral, typed out part of his side of the conversation on a screen, before sharing a hug. \"Cruise couldn't have been cooler,\" Kilmer said. \"Tom and I took up where we left off. The reunion felt great.\"\n\nGetty Images Barry Tubb (left) and Val Kilmer reunited on stage in 2019\n\nMany of the cast had remained friends after the original film, Tubb says, and Rossovich's home in the Hollywood Hills became the \"Top Gun club house\". \"I remember going to Rick's house and they were painting Rick's kitchen, and Val got up on top of the refrigerator and did 20 minutes of Hamlet. Never missed a word.\" Kilmer was \"an actors' actor\", who raised the bar for the rest of the cast, Tubb says. \"He had a level of artistry that transcended the Hollywood norm. \"Val was a cool cat. Also, he could back it up. I remember seeing The Doors movie and I just saw Jim Morrison. \"His ability to disappear into characters was incredible. Same with Iceman.\" He adds: \"Val, among his peers, was well loved. He came fully loaded.\" The love for Kilmer has shone through in the tributes from his fellow actors. Kelly McGillis, who played Cruise's love interest Charlie and starred with Kilmer in 1999's At First Sight, told the BBC in a statement: \"I need some time to process what Val has meant in my walk here on Earth. \"He was an enigmatic presence sprinkled here & there throughout my journey. A force with depth & weight which will take some time to sort out. \"There are just so many feelings at the moment. \"Gratitude being the first.\"\n\nCheeseburgers on set\n\nGetty Images British actor Will Kemp recalled Kilmer spontaneously pulling a cheeseburger out during one take",

attempted to make him real i manifested a backstory for him where he had a father who ignored him and as a result was driven by the need to be perfect in every way this obsession with perfection is what made him so arrogant getty images the pairs rivalry was a key component of the films plot he added that he would purposely play up the rivalry between toms character and mine off screen as well as on what ended up happening is the actors in true method fashion split into two distinct camps you had maverick and goose on one side and slider hollywood wolfman and me iceman on the other it was fun to play up the conflict between our characters but in reality ive always thought of tom as a friend and weve always supported each other by the time a sequel was finally shot in 2018 and 2019 kilmer had suffered from throat cancer he had a tracheotomy operation affecting his voice and making it difficult to speak but cruise was the one who insisted iceman should return the pair shared a highly emotional scene as kilmers character now an admiral typed out part of his side of the conversation on a screen before sharing a hug cruise couldnt have been cooler kilmer said tom and i took up where we left off the reunion felt great getty images barry tubb left and val kilmer reunited on stage in 2019 many of the cast had remained friends after the original film tubb says and rossovichs

never missed a word kilmer was an actors actor who raised the bar for the rest of the cast tubb says he had a level of artistry that transcended the hollywood norm val was a cool cat also he could back it up i remember seeing the doors movie and i just saw jim morrison his ability to disappear into characters was incredible same with iceman he adds val among his peers was well loved he came fully loaded the love for kilmer has shone through in the tributes from his fellow actors kelly mcgillis who played cruises love interest charlie and starred with kilmer in 1999s at first sight told the bbc in a statement i need some time to process what val has meant in my walk here on earth he was an enigmatic presence sprinkled here there throughout my journey a force with depth weight which

    "body": "Inside the rural Texas town where Elon Musk is basing his business empire\n\n19 April 2025 Share Save Mike Wendling \u2022 @mwendling BBC News Reporting from Bastrop, Texas Share Save\n\nGetty Images The site pictured in 2023, with SpaceX facilities at the top, The Boring Company located to the left and the building housing local businesses in the centre. Since then, the development has expanded further.\n\nAfter fleeing Silicon Valley for political and business reasons, Elon Musk is building a corporate campus in rural Texas \u2013 but his new neighbours have mixed views. Half an hour east of Austin, past the airport, the clogged-up traffic starts to melt away and the plains of Central Texas open up, leaving the booming city behind. Somewhere along the main two-lane highway, a left turn takes drivers down Farm-to-Market Road 1209. It seems like an unlikely address for a high-tech hub, but that's exactly what Elon Musk, the world's richest man and one of President Donald Trump's closest allies, hopes it will become. Court filings indicate that a large metal building finished in the last few months will be the new headquarters of X, his social media platform. A short distance away, a large logo of the Boring Company, Musk's infrastructure company, is plastered on the side of another headquarters. And across FM 1209 is a rapidly growing SpaceX facility which manufactures Starlink satellite internet equipment. Like most technology tycoons, Musk had long made Silicon Valley his home and headquarters. Once a supporter of the Democrats, his move to Texas is part of a larger tech world trend and also appears to reflect his own transformed ideological views. Here the land is (relatively) cheap, skilled tech workers from nearby Austin are plentiful, and local laws are favourable to development. Of course, there are also specific political angles to the move. In July 2024, Musk said he was quitting California after the state passed a law prohibiting teachers from enforcing rules about notifying families when students' gender identity changes. Musk has an estranged transgender daughter and has spoken out against what he calls \"woke mind virus\" - which he describes in interviews as divisive identity politics - along with anti-meritocratic and anti-free speech ideas. And so Musk upped sticks and headed to Texas, a Republican stronghold and the fastest-growing state in the US.\n\nBBC/Mike Wendling The entrance to a small cluster of shops and facilities near the corporate headquarters\n\nIn addition to the cluster of buildings near Bastrop in central Texas, he has built a SpaceX facility in Cameron County, on the southern tip of Texas near the border with Mexico. SpaceX employees there have filed a petition to create a new town called Starbase. The measure will go to a vote in May. Locals in Bastrop have mixed feelings about the development. \"It's almost like we have a split personality,\" says Sylvia Carrillo, city manager of Bastrop, which has a growing population of more than 12,000. \"Residents are happy that their children and grandchildren will have jobs in the area. \"On the other hand it can feel like we are being overwhelmed by a third party and that the development will quickly urbanise our area,\" she says. Although the Musk development is technically outside of the city's limits, it's close enough that Texas laws give Bastrop's government sway over development. And, Ms Carrillo stresses, the Musk buildings are just one example of many developments springing up in a booming area. \"He's faced a backlash that is not entirely of his own creating,\" she says. \"But now that he's here and things are changing quickly, it's a matter of managing\" issues like house and land prices and the environment, she says. The Musk compound is still fairly bare-bones. The grandly named Hyperloop Plaza sits in the middle of the corporate buildings, and is home to the company-owned Boring Bodega, a bar, coffee shop, hairdresser and gift shop. On a recent windy Sunday afternoon, a video game console sat unplayed in front of a couch near a display of company T-shirts, while a few children scurried back and forth to a playground outside. The developments in Bastrop fit right into the quickening pace of activity across central Texas, where cranes perpetually loom above the Austin skyline and the housing market is a perpetual topic of conversation. The area has gone through various industry booms and busts over the years, including lumber and coal mining, says Judy Enis, a volunteer guide at the Bastrop Museum and Visitor Center. During World War Two, tens of thousands of soldiers - and around 10,000 German prisoners of war - poured in to Camp Swift, a US Army facility north of the town. \"That probably had more of an impact than Elon Musk,\" Ms Enis notes.\n\nBBC/Mike Wendling Local officials and residents hope to keep the charm of Bastrop's bustling and old-fashioned downtown\n\nViews of the tycoon are mixed, to say the least, and inseparable not only from his politics but also opinions on economic development, in what still is a predominately rural area. Judah Ross, a local real estate agent, says the development has supercharged population growth that started as a result of the Austin boom and accelerated during the Covid pandemic. \"I'm always going to be biased because I want the growth,\" Mr Ross says. \"But I love it here and I want to be part of it. \"If nothing else, what's good is the amount of jobs that this is bringing in,\" he says. \"In the past year, I've sold to people working at Boring and SpaceX.\" Alfonso Lopez, a Texan who returned to the state after working in tech in Seattle, says he initially picked Bastrop figuring he would make a quick buck on a house purchase and move on. Instead, he quickly became enamoured with the town, its mix of local businesses and friendly people, and wants to stay.\n\nBBC/Mike Wendling Alfonso Lopez, like many Bastrop residents, has a balanced view of Musk, his companies and their impact on the local area\n\nMr Lopez is no big fan of Musk and is critical of some of his management practices and politics, but admires the technology his companies have built and is happy to live nearby as long as the companies are good neighbours. \"As long as they don't ruin my water or dig a tunnel beneath my house and create a sinkhole, this isn't bad,\" he says, gesturing around the metal shed housing the bodega, coffee shop and bar. \"I'll come here and watch a game.\" His concerns about water are more than theoretical. Last year The Boring Company was fined $11,876 (\u00a38,950) by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality after being cited for water pollution violations. The Boring Company initially planned to dump wastewater in the nearby Colorado River but, after local pressure, signed a deal to send the sludge to a Bastrop wastewater treatment plant. The water issues appear to have delayed housebuilding, which reportedly could include more than 100 homes for Musk employees. The planned development of homes has so far failed to materialise, however. For now, the extent of living quarters is a handful of temporary trailers behind the bodega building, surrounded by a wall, acres of Texas plain and a few horses munching grass. Ms Carrillo, the city manager, says any large-scale home building is at least a year off.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn November, SpaceX applied for a free trade zone designation, which would allow it to move materials and finished products in and out of the Bastrop factory without being subject to tariffs - one of Donald Trump's signature policies. It's a common practice for manufacturers, and there are hundreds of similar zones across the country. Local officials in Texas have endorsed the proposal, saying it will boost the local economy, despite costing the county an estimated $45,000 (\u00a334,800) in revenue this year. The company is also getting an injection of $17.3m (\u00a313.4m) from the Texas government to develop the site, a grant that officials say is expected to create more than 400 jobs and $280m in capital investment in Bastrop. Few local residents wanted to directly criticise Musk when standing face-to-face with a visiting reporter. But it's a different story online, where sharper feelings shine through. \"They will ruin everything nearby,\" one resident posted on a local online forum. \"Nothing good comes with him.\"\n\nBBC/Mike Wendling Bastrop recently passed laws to protect green spaces and prevent dense housing developments. The Boring Company recently paid a fine because of wastewater discharge into the Colorado River, shown on the left",

A single white rose was pictured lying on the stone tomb that bears the name he was known by during his pontificate, below a crucifix illuminated by a single spotlight. The late pope was laid to rest at the church - one of four major basilicas in the Italian capital, and one he would regularly visit during his time as cardinal and pontiff - in a private ceremony following his public funeral in the Vatican on Saturday. Thousands of mourners have been filing past the tomb since the church opened to the public on Sunday morning to pay their respects to Pope Francis, who died aged 88 on Monday.\n\nGetty Images A single white rose was pictured lying on the stone tomb bearing Pope Francis's name\n\nAmong them was Rosario Correale, an Italian, who said it was \"very emotional\" seeing the tomb. \"He really left a mark on us,\" he told the Associated Press. Polish pilgrim Maria Brzezinska felt the resting place befit the man. \"I feel like it's exactly in the way of the Pope. He was simple, and so is his place now,\" she told the news agency Reuters after visiting. Francis was particularly devoted to the Virgin Mary, and Santa Maria Maggiore was the first church to be dedicated to her when it was built in the 4th Century. The basilica sits near the Colosseum, a stone's throw from the city's endlessly bustling and chaotic central Termini station - well beyond the limits of the Vatican, where popes are traditionally entombed. But it was one the South American pontiff had a long-held affinity for. Its senior priest previously told an Italian newspaper that Pope Francis had said he wished to be laid to rest there in 2022, citing inspiration from the Virgin Mary. \"I thought it was amazing that he wanted to be buried here in this basilica,\" Amaya Morris, another pilgrim, told AP. \"Out of all of the [churches], he chose this one. So I thought that was really amazing. It's really humbling to be able to be here.\" Francis's funeral was attended by heads of state, heads of government and monarchs from around the world - as well as hundreds of thousands of Catholics who lined the streets leading to the Vatican to pay their respects. Hymns played out on giant speakers, occasionally drowned out by the sound of helicopters flying overhead, before 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re gave a homily on the pope's legacy. The cardinal emphasised that Pope Francis had repeatedly urged the world to \"build bridges, not walls\".\n\nReuters Mourners queued outside the church early on Sunday morning to be among the first to pay their respects",

Sir Elton, 78, has repeatedly accused Madonna of lip syncing over the years, prompting Madonna's team - back in 2004 - to respond that she did not \"spend her time trashing other artists\". The music legends reconciled over the weekend after Madonna went to \"confront\" Sir Elton following his performance on Saturday Night Live (SNL), she wrote on Instagram. \"The first thing out of his mouth was 'forgive me', and the wall between us fell down,\" she added.\n\nThe Vogue singer, 66, said she had been a fan of Sir Elton since she was a teenager. \"Seeing him perform when I was in high school changed the course of my life,\" the post read. \"Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist. I didn't understand it.\" The strain on the pair's relationship has its roots in the noughties. In 2004, Sir Elton ridiculed Madonna's nomination in the Best Live Act category at the Q Awards, using explicit language. He asked: \"Since when has lip syncing been live?\" \"Anyone who lip syncs in public on stage when you pay \u00a375 to see them should be shot,\" he continued. Madonna's team denied that she did not sing live. Sir Elton doubled down on his criticism in the years that followed, and in 2012 said Madonna didn't stand a \"chance\" of beating him to the Golden Globe for best original song. After picking up the award for her song Masterpiece, Madonna told reporters she hoped Sir Elton would \"speak to me for the next couple of years\". \"He's been known to get mad at me.\" In her post on Monday, Madonna suggested the reconciliation may lead to a musical partnership. \"He told me [he] had written a song for me and he wanted to collaborate.\"\n\nAllow Instagram content?

    "body": "Boy gets eight years detention for Army chaplain stabbing\n\n29 April 2025 Share Save Share Save\n\nPA Media Father Paul Murphy outside the Central Criminal Court in Dublin on 29 April\n\nA 17-year-old boy who stabbed an Army chaplain outside a barracks in the Republic of Ireland last year has been sentenced to 10 years detention with the final two suspended. Fr Paul Murphy was stabbed seven times with a hunting knife while attempting to drive into Renmore Barracks in Galway in August 2024. The teenager, aged 16 at the time, was arrested at the scene after being restrained by members of the Defence Forces. The boy, who cannot be identified because of his age, had pleaded guilty to attempted murder earlier this year.\n\nIrish broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported that the judge said the case demonstrated dangers to children caused by their exposure to and influence by extreme views online. The judge said the teenager had been radicalised and this was rooted in him being drawn in through the internet to extreme views. He said the teen's vulnerability to this was exacerbated by his social isolation, his prolonged engagement with certain websites and his autism spectrum disorder. The judge added that the boy was not experienced enough to understand the warped and twisted perspectives he encountered. The teenager was ordered by the judge to be supervised for three years after his release. The judge also ordered that he must undergo any programmes, including a deradicalisation programme, as directed by the Probation Service. Before the teenager was taken back into custody, Fr Murphy spoke to him for a few moments after shaking his hand. The sentence has been backdated to when the teenager entered custody in August.\n\nPA Media The incident happened at Renmore Barracks in County Galway in August 2024\n\nSpeaking outside the court on Tuesday, Fr Murphy said it was \"very easy for us to fight hatred with hatred and the world just becomes entrenched in hatred and that is the way the world is at the moment\". \"St John said that God is love and if we believe God to be love, then we know that love is stronger than hate and so to respond to hate with love will hopefully bring a different world for us all\". Fr Murphy said his \"only hope\" for the boy is that \"he will return to society better able to manage his own life and also to make a more positive contribution to society\". \"My focus now is to get home to prepare for the international and military pilgrimage to Lourdes which is coming up and then three days after that, I deploy to Lebanon for six months,\" he said.\n\nPrevious hearing\n\nFollowing a court hearing earlier in April, Fr Murphy offered forgiveness to the 17-year-old and hugged him. The Central Criminal Court in Dublin heard that the boy, who was 16 at the time, supported the so-called Islamic State (IS) group and had been radicalised online. CCTV footage showed showed Father Murphy driving his jeep through the gates of the barracks, after the teenager began stabbing him with a hunting knife. The boy hung on to the side of the vehicle and continued to stab the priest as the car moved. RT\u00c9 reported that when the boy was arrested, he told garda\u00ed: \"I did it. I attacked the guy in the car.\" He said he did it to \"protect the Irish Defence Forces work in Mali and all the stuff for Islam\". Analysis of a device found at his home found content suggestive of a radicalised Islamic mindset. A poster with Arabic writing saying 'Allahu Akhar' or 'God of Great' were found in the boy's home during a search. An Islamic State flag and a notebook with writing and graphic sketches depicting beheadings were also found. The teenager denied the sketches were his. The court heard he had converted to Islam at the age of 15. During interviews, the teenager claimed he had no real recollection of the incident, but he apologised, saying he did not realise the man he stabbed was a priest. He said he had mental health problems and said: \"I don't know what made me do it.\"",

    "body": "Three million child deaths linked to drug resistance, study shows\n\n12 April 2025 Share Save Dominic Hughes Global health correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images Escherichia coli bacteria - also known as E. coli, the bug that causes food poisoning - is one of the bacteria that is showing greater resistance to front-line antibiotics\n\nMore than three million children around the world are thought to have died in 2022 as a result of infections that are resistant to antibiotics, according to a study by two leading experts in child health. Children in Africa and South East Asia were found to be most at risk. Antimicrobial resistance - known as AMR - develops when the microbes that cause infections evolve in such a way that antibiotic drugs no longer work. It has been identified as one of the biggest public health threats facing the world's population.\n\nA new study now reveals the toll that AMR is taking on children. Using data from multiple sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, the report's authors have calculated there were more than three million child deaths in 2022 linked to drug-resistant infections.\n\nExperts say this new study highlights a more than tenfold increase in AMR-related infections in children in just three years. The number could have been made worse by the impact of the Covid pandemic.\n\nIncreased use of antibiotics\n\nAntibiotics are used to treat or prevent a huge range of bacterial infections - everything from skin infections to pneumonia. They are also sometimes given as a precaution to prevent, rather than treat, an infection - for example if someone is having an operation or receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer. Antibiotics have no impact on viral infections, though - illnesses such as the common cold, flu or Covid. But some bacteria have now evolved resistance to some drugs, due to their overuse and inappropriate use, while the production of new antibiotics - a lengthy and costly process - has slowed right down. The report's lead authors, Doctor Yanhong Jessika Hu of Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia and Professor Herb Harwell of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, point to a significant growth in the use of antibiotics that are meant to only be held back for the most serious infections. Between 2019 and 2021 the use of \"watch antibiotics\", drugs with a high risk of resistance, increased by 160% in South East Asia and 126% in Africa. Over the same period, \"reserve antibiotics\" - last-resort treatments for severe, multidrug-resistant infections - rose by 45% in South East Asia and 125% in Africa.\n\nDwindling options\n\nThe authors warn that if bacteria develop resistance to these antibiotics, there will be few, if any, alternatives for treating multidrug-resistant infections. Prof Harwell is presenting the findings at the Congress of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Vienna later this month. \"AMR is a global problem. It affects everyone. We did this work really to focus on the disproportionate way in which AMR affects children,\" he said ahead of the event. \"We estimate three million deaths of children worldwide associated with antimicrobial resistance.\"\n\nIs there a solution to AMR?",

Narendra Vikramaditya Yadav - also known as Dr N John Camm - worked as a cardiologist at a missionary hospital in Madhya Pradesh state. Police accuse him of fraud, cheating and forgery and allege that the 53-year-old, who has worked as a doctor for almost two decades, faked his medical degrees. They are also investigating allegations that he added the name of Prof John Camm, a leading cardiologist at UK's St George Hospital, to his own to gain credibility. Mr Yadav has denied the allegations against him.\n\nOn Monday, just hours before he was arrested, he sent a legal notice of 50m rupees ($580,000; \u00a3455,000) to two dozen individuals and publishers for claiming he impersonated \"some other cardiologist\". The Mission Hospital in Damoh city, where Mr Yadav worked for a few weeks, has denied having any knowledge of his alleged fake credentials. \"Nobody suspected him of being a fake doctor. He was good at his job and acted like a big-time professor,\" a hospital official told The Indian Express newspaper. The case first came to light in February, when a child welfare committee in Damoh flagged the deaths to district officials. \"We got suspicious about his expertise and checked his credentials online and found that he had cases against him in at least three states,\" claimed Deepak Tiwari, president of the district Child Welfare Committee. An investigation found that Mr Yadav had quit his job at the hospital earlier that month and \"gone missing\" without explanation. He was arrested in the city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh state on Monday evening. \"The accused doctor had worked on a total of 64 cases, including 45 cases of angioplasty, which led to seven patient deaths,\" the district's police chief Shrut Kirti Somvanshi told BBC Hindi. It's not yet clear whether his degrees are genuine or fake, but police believe they were likely to be forged as the documents lack key details, such as a unique registration number given to each student.\n\nBBC Hindi The hospital where Narendra Vikramaditya Yadav worked",

Speaking to Times Radio, Wes Streeting said: \"I certainly am concerned about the public health situation and the poor conditions we're seeing for people in Birmingham. \"As the bin bags are piling up, we see rats and other vermin crawling around.\" Birmingham City Council said on Tuesday morning: \"All of our waste wagons have been deployed from our three depots citywide this morning.\"\n\nPiles of rubbish - like this one in Bordesley Green - have become a familiar sight on the streets of Birmingham\n\nAsking residents to leave their bins out as they normally would, the authority said it would collect them \"asap\" and apologised for what it called \"the current situation\". Natasha, whose 11-week-old son's immune system is impaired due to being born prematurely, told BBC Radio WM part of her street in Winson Green was \"quite literally a waste site\", blocking her route to the bus stop. \"That pathway is basically covered in black bin bags and physical household waste bins that are overflowing,\" she said. \"You can clearly see where rodents have actually bitten into the bin bags and they've been opened up. \"Do I walk past that tip point, where all that rubbish is, where all the rodents are accumulating, and all the pests are? \"Or do I... walk on the road with my son's pushchair? \"Essentially, I'm having to choose between my son becoming possibly critically ill or being hit by a car.\" Talks between bin workers and the city council ended on Tuesday without an agreement being reached. \"No resolution has yet been reached but Unite has put forward a range of fair and reasonable solutions to bring this dispute to an end,\" the union said.\n\nLDRS One Birmingham resident attended Tuesday's full council meeting as a rat and praised the council helping the rat population\n\nDuring public questions at a council meeting on Tuesday, a resident in a rodent costume asked Majid Mahmood, cabinet member for environment, when the rat population would decline and when streets would return to an \"acceptable state\". Mahmood said he understood and sympathised with residents' frustrations and that was why a major incident was declared. The strike has made headlines around the world, and last week the city council declared a major incident. With the backlog of waste growing by 1,000 tonnes a week, neighbouring Lichfield District Council is due to start sending crews to help clear it.\n\nA mountain of waste including drinks cans, milk bottles, a roll of carpet, coffee cups and a sofa built up opposite a school in Alum Rock\n\nThe impact of fly-tipping on communities in the West Midlands, due to the strike, was debated in the Commons on Tuesday. Wendy Morton, Conservative MP for Aldridge-Brownhills said neighbouring councils must not be left out of pocket as result of the strikes which were having a \"knock-on effect\" in Walsall with extra demand on recycling centres and traffic building up. Council tax payers in Walsall would end up footing the bill, she added, while she said she understood neighbouring councils were offering to help clear up the rubbish.\n\nPhotographs of the waste have made headlines across the world\n\n\"If this were to be the case and other local authorities were helping, can we be reassured that any costs incurred would be funded by the government or Birmingham City Council because I don't feel it's the job of my local tax payers to be funding the clean-up of Birmingham's streets?,\" she added. Morton urged ministers to condemn the strike and step in to bring it to an end. Environment Minister Daniel Zeichner said while he recognises the gravity of the situation, it was best to work with people locally to find a solution. Bin workers began indefinite strike action on 11 March, although walkouts have been taking place since January. They are fighting plans to remove some roles and downgrade others.

    "title": "Trump's first 100 days and the rapid remaking of a nation",
    "body": "The rapid remaking of a nation, in 100 days\n\n27 April 2025 Share Save Anthony Zurcher and Tom Geoghegan BBC News, Washington Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nDuring last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House. But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed. In the three months since he took the oath of office, the 47th president has deployed his power in a way that compares to few predecessors. In stacks of bound documents signed off with a presidential pen and policy announcements made in all caps on social media, his blizzard of executive actions has reached into every corner of American life. To his supporters, the shock-and-awe approach has been a tangible demonstration of an all-action president, delivering on his promises and enacting long-awaited reforms. But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process. Here are six turning points from the first 100 days.\n\nA social media post sets off a constitutional firestorm\n\nFor once, it wasn't a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry. Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term. \"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he declared on X. In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy. Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution. Vance's words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America's founders. But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts.\n\nGetty Images Three co-equal branches of government - legislative, executive, and judicial - were crafted by America's founders\n\nThe White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies. This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers. The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times. Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court. A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted. \"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote. Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply. It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith. While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principal agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there.\n\nBrandishing a chainsaw, dressed in black\n\nElon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd. The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise. Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw. \"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\"\n\nGetty Images Elon Musk leaves the stage holding a chainsaw after speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference\n\nIt was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful. Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash. Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education. While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public. Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events. Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly. Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending. If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity.\n\n'I had to think fast as billions was lost before my eyes'\n\nWhen trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast. \"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says. McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\". He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold. \"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\" He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement. The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since.\n\nGetty Images The US stock market plummeted after President Trump announced \"Liberation Day\" tariffs\n\nThe economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory. His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans. But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent. The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs. The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession. While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field. \"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\" Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration.\n\nSpotted in a photo - 'My son, shackled in prison'\n\n\"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world. She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows. At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter. When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.\n\nReuters US deports alleged members of the Venezuela gang Tren de Aragua to Cecot prison in El Salvador\n\nThe Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent. A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge. Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years. A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz. Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas. Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted. While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches. They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways.\n\nA clash with academic, media and corporate worlds\n\nOn 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on. In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants. It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations. The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address. But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024. The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers.\n\nGetty Images Protesters gather inside Harvard University\n\nEarlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department. A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds. Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives. Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments. A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (\u00a311m) to Trump's presidential foundation. CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media. The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president. On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted. Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls.\n\nA retreat on race and identity\n\nThe press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River. Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack. A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence. It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world.\n\nGetty Images A crane removes plane wreckage from the Potomac River\n\nTrump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\". His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes. First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups. Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers. But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America. While Trump's directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows. Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word \"gay\".\n\nDonald Trump's first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president. His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire. In other ways, however, Trump's efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president. And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question. Later this year, the narrow Republican majorities in Congress will attempt to provide the legislative backing for Trump's agenda, but their success is far from guaranteed. And in next year's mid-term congressional elections, those majorities could be replaced by hostile Democrats bent on investigating the administration and curtailing his authority. Meanwhile, more court battles loom - and while the US Supreme Court has a conservative tilt, its decisions on a number of key cases could ultimately cut against Trump's efforts. The first 100 days of Trump's second term have been a dramatic show of political force, but the next 1,361 will be the real test of whether he can carve an enduring legacy.",

    "body": "Under $15\n\nCovergirl Clean Invisible Concealer had decent coverup, but only offered 12 shades.\n\nWhile E.L.F. 16HR Camo Concealer came in 24 hues at the time of testing, its oversized wand was unwieldy, and it had a powdery, dull finish.\n\nMakeup Revolution IRL Filter Finish Concealer had weak coverage, a streaky finish, and a narrow shade range.\n\nWe were let down by a drugstore-favorite, Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Multi-Use Concealer, which provided so-so coverage, dried cakey, and settled into fine lines. Its twisting sponge applicator was also a pain to use. And its shade range had big jumps, particularly frustrating our panelists with deeper skin tones.\n\n$16 to $34\n\nThe dry, very matte Benefit Boi-ing Cakeless Concealer was hard to move around and looked patchy on the skin.\n\nCharlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Radiant Concealer had a glimmering, light-reflecting finish, but also deposited teeny, glitter-like particulates across the skin.\n\nKnown for its inclusive shade range, Fenty Beauty We\u2019re Even Hydrating Longwear Concealer looked simultaneously dry and patchy under the eyes and shiny in the T-zone. Its white plastic top and tippy, angled bottom also looked cheap, given the price.\n\nSlick Glossier Stretch Balm Concealer seemed to highlight tiny under-eye bumps.\n\nThe too-big wand for Haus Labs Triclone Skin Tech Hydrating + De-puffing Concealer had to be tugged out and jammed back in the tube, and the formula caked.\n\nEven though Ilia True Skin Serum Concealer slid on easily, it dried with creasing.\n\nIronically, It Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye Concealer did a much better job at covering redness than under-eye circles. Distinctively thick and tacky, it was more challenging to blend, and its finish tended to be a bit shiny. While its shade range included 24 hues, it didn\u2019t increase gradually for deeper skin tones, and neither of our panelists on that end of the spectrum could find shades that matched them.\n\nBeloved for lighter skin tones, Laura Mercier Real Flawless Weightless Perfecting Concealer has smooth matte coverage, but its price per weight was high compared with similarly performing products.\n\nMany testers found that the lightweight Lanc\u00f4me Teint Idole Concealer required multiple layers for effective coverage, its applicator head was the \u201cbulkiest,\u201d and it didn\u2019t have much staying power.\n\nNatural-looking Make Up For Ever HD Concealer had solid, buildable coverage, but it was not exceptional enough to justify its high price versus other concealers that we advanced to panel testing.\n\nMilk Makeup Future Fluid Concealer had a tacky, difficult-to-spread consistency and a powdery, drying finish.\n\nThe thick consistency of Nars Soft Matte Complete Concealer required more-expert makeup application, and most panelists found the mattifying effects emphasized creases. But it was the favorite of a 20-something with combo skin who loved the texture and found that it \u201ctoned down oiliness.\"\n\nPat McGrath Labs Skin Fetsh: Sublime Perfection Full Coverage Concealer had a thick formula that covered redness quite well, but it was also slightly drying and quite pricey for its weight.\n\nEven though Tarte Shape Tape Full-Coverage Concealer was the most full coverage in its line, which also includes medium-coverage and creamy variants, panelists found it didn\u2019t cover under-eye circles particularly well. And its sticky consistency tended to cake for most testers. It did, however, effectively cover a birthmark in one layer.\n\nCreamy Tower 28 Swipe Serum Concealer provided solid under-eye coverage, and most testers appreciated the doe-foot applicator\u2019s flexibility and tiny head, but it didn\u2019t perform well in obscuring redness.\n\n$35 and up\n\nThe glamorous Armani Beauty Luminous Silk Hydrating & Brightening Concealer had a glimmering finish that just looked expensive, but its longevity was \u201cmediocre.\u201d And one of our testers was very frustrated that Armani didn\u2019t offer deeper shades in more undertone options.\n\nA cult-favorite and go-to for supervising beauty editor Hannah Morrill, Cl\u00e9 de Peau Concealer SPF 27 provides excellent matte coverage in a single swipe. But its sky-high price and limited shade range kept it from advancing to panel testing.\n\nThough Givenchy Prisme Libre Skin-Caring Concealer and pricier-by-weight Est\u00e9e Lauder Futurist Soft Touch Brightening Skincealer both blended smoothly and provided good coverage, they also creased or settled into fine lines for half of our panelists as the day progressed. Many also found the Givenchy concealer\u2019s larger applicator head to be clunky.\n\nEncased in a \u201csexy\u201d frosted, tapered bottle, Hourglass Vanish Airbrush Concealer knocked it out of the park in longevity and coverage for all targeted areas. But panelists balked when asked if they\u2019d buy it themselves.\n\nFor no-makeup makeup girlies, dewy RMS Beauty UnCoverup Concealer did indeed leave a glowy finish, but the price per weight was quite high.\n\nToo Faced Born This Way Super Coverage Multi-Use Concealer had a tacky, difficult-to-spread consistency and also slightly emphasized skin texture.\n\nMore of a highlighter, exorbitantly priced Yves St Laurent Touche \u00c9clat Awakening Concealer Click Pen doesn\u2019t offer much coverage, and its click-pen applicator took a lot of clicking to get going and then released too much product all at once.\n\nThis article was edited by Hannah Morrill and Jennifer Hunter.",

    "title": "The Best Tablecloths",
    "body": "We focused only on tablecloths made from natural fibers. The most common and affordable natural-fiber table linens are made from cotton. Prices vary depending on the quality of the fiber, the construction, and sometimes the name brand. Cotton linens generally have the smooth, polished look of tablecloths you\u2019d see in a fine-dining restaurant.\n\nLinen is also a great material for tablecloths. Made from the fibers of the flax plant, linen is absorbent and has a more-relaxed drape than cotton. Threads spun from flax fibers are thicker than cotton, and the result is the distinct, visible woven texture that linen goods are known for.\n\nQuality craftsmanship and thoughtful details separate good tablecloths from great ones. Hems with clean, straight stitching and minimal puckering are a sign of a well-made product. Deep hems measuring at least 1 inch and mitered corners on square or rectangular shapes add weight to the drape and give tablecloths a polished drop. But round and oval tablecloths should be finished with a narrower hem, about \u00bc inch or \u215c inch, to avoid puckering.\n\n\u201cPuckering\u201d describes the little ripples that appear along the hemline of a tablecloth after it\u2019s laundered. This can happen if the fabric and thread shrink at different rates, the stitch tension is too tight, or the fabric wasn\u2019t laundered before sewing. All of the tablecloths we\u2019ve tested have puckered at various rates, but the worst offenders came out of the wash with rippled and fluttered hems that were impossible to iron flat.\n\nWe looked for tablecloths that are available in multiple sizes and shapes. Dining tables come in many sizes and shapes (square, rectangle, oval, and square). We set out to find the most attractive, high-quality tablecloths that come in a variety of cuts and dimensions.\n\nMeasure your dining table, and then add 20 to 24 inches to the length to account for an appropriate drop. Or you can use this Williams Sonoma chart. Keep in mind that all table linens made from natural fibers will shrink after laundering, about 5% in length and 3% in width. So if you\u2019re worried about a tablecloth\u2019s drop becoming too short after laundering, be safe and go up a size.\n\nTo test durability, we washed, dried, and pressed the tablecloths with a steam iron. We examined the fabric for pilling and the hems for puckering and fraying. We also measured each piece to gauge shrinkage after laundering. Any natural-fiber tablecloth will shrink some after the first wash.\n\nWe also looked at how attractive they were while in use. We draped the tablecloths over countertops, desks, and tables to examine the drape and drop of each one.",

    "body": "Michael Murtaugh/NYT Wirecutter Michael Murtaugh/NYT Wirecutter; prop styling by Andrea Bonin Michael Murtaugh/NYT Wirecutter\n\nVanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer is a go-to for dermatologists and sensitive skin types alike, thanks to its blend of humectants, such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin, and emollients, like ceramides and squalane. It absorbs readily, leaves skin plumped, and even softens the appearance of fine lines, however temporarily. The packaging isn\u2019t charming, but none of our testers could deny its efficacy.\n\nIt boasts no-nonsense ingredients. While many of the moisturizers we considered had more than 50 ingredients, Vanicream moisturizer\u2019s lean and mean 19 includes the derm-anointed all-stars we looked for: squalane, glycerin, glycol, hyaluronic acid, and five different ceramides. Also, it notably lacks common chemical irritants like fragrances, dyes, lanolin, parabens, and formaldehyde releasers. The fine-tuned ingredient panel leaves little room for irritation, and none of our eight testers\u2014even those with sensitive skin\u2014reported any issues.\n\nThe packaging is dismal, but the texture is sublime. Inside the meh plastic tube is an absolutely breathtaking formula. \u201cThe silky texture could easily pass for Chanel,\u201d noted one panelist, who even considered decanting it into a more vanity-worthy jar. Medium-weight and highly emollient, the cream glides on effortlessly, absorbs beautifully, and works well under makeup (several options we tested, like one from EltaMD, either pilled or repelled cosmetics). Most compellingly, it leaves our skin softer than moisturizers costing 10 times as much.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to work this cream into a skin-care routine. Even panelists who didn\u2019t have sensitive skin appreciated Vanicream moisturizer for another reason: its layerability. A tester working a prescription tretinoin back into her routine after pregnancy found it was an ideal base layer to prevent the initial skin flare-up she was expecting. Some of the creams we tested had nearly a hundred ingredients, like Cl\u00e9 de Peau (84). More ingredients means more chances for reactivity, especially when paired with compounds like vitamin C, retinol, and alpha hydroxy acids (AHA). Vanicream moisturizer keeps it basic, in the best way.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers",

    "body": "Michael Murtaugh/NYT Wirecutter; food styling by Maggie Ruggiero\n\nPlain potato chips\n\nMost of our panel liked Herr\u2019s Crisp \u2019N Tasty Potato Chips for their golden color and good potato flavor but found them to be blander and less light and crispy than some of our picks.\n\n365 by Whole Foods Organic Sea Salt Potato Chips had an earthy potato flavor most tasters liked, but not as much as our picks. They looked earthy, too: large, flat, pale chips with a wisp of potato skin at the edges.\n\nSal de Ibiza Chips from Spain were one of the only imported chips our panel liked. These large, sunny chips had a great flavor and were very crispy, but most felt they were just a little too greasy.\n\nMost tasters liked these smaller, thin and crunchy Market Pantry Classic Potato Chips made for Target but didn\u2019t consider them a favorite, noting that they had a slightly darker flavor and color than many of our picks and a slightly more oily flavor.\n\nMost tasters really liked Lay\u2019s Classic Potato Chips, noting a big crunch and balanced salt-and-potato flavor, but several noted the taste felt subdued compared with that of our picks.\n\nWalker\u2019s Legendary Ready Salted Potato Chips, imported from the United Kingdom, garnered a very similar reaction. (Both brands are owned by PepsiCo.)\n\nWe liked the potato flavor of Wise Snacks Golden Original Potato Chips\u2014darker-brown chips that are on the smaller side and salty\u2014but they were a little oilier than most.\n\nHerr\u2019s Crisp \u2019N Tasty Potato Chips had a nice, toasted, oven-fried potato flavor, but the salt was unevenly applied.\n\nSome tasters thought Trader Joe\u2019s Ode to the Classic Potato Chip were pale and tasted slightly stale, though they had a nutty, balanced flavor and snappy texture.\n\nOur panel found that Old Dutch Original Potato Chips had a dense, too-dry texture and some vegetal off-flavors, and they needed more salt.\n\nMartin\u2019s Sea Salted Potato Chips are made with shortening instead of vegetable oil, and our panel did not like their starchy, powdery texture. A few tasters also noticed bitter off-flavors.\n\nTasters did not like Whole Foods Organic potato chips, which had some green spots in addition to thicker pieces of potato peel, and stale, rancid flavors.\n\nBoth Gibble\u2019s Original Potato Chips and Kay & Ray\u2019s Premium Potato Chips, also made by Gibble\u2019s, are fried in lard, and even tasters that like our old-fashioned picks found the aftertaste of the animal fat unpleasant.\n\nMiddleswarth Potato Chips are also made with lard. Several tasters liked these chips but said that the flavor, reminiscent of fast-food french fries, wasn\u2019t suited to a plain potato chip.\n\nWe dismissed Better Made Special Original Potato Chips, which had an unpleasantly strong oil flavor that was almost porky, even though they are not made with lard.\n\nSterzing\u2019s Potato Chips, a regional brand from Iowa, tasted like older, musty oil.\n\nSnyder of Berlin Original Potato Chips were light and crisp, though some tasters found the oil a little rancid.\n\nThe batch of Spain\u2019s Bonilla a La Vista chips we tried had rancid oil flavors, which surprised us\u2014multiple tasters on the panel had tried these beautiful, sunny chips in the past and loved them. We recommend them in several gift guides for that reason and for the fun factor of receiving a big tin of chips as a gift. But because of the potential for stale chips, we couldn\u2019t make them a pick in this guide.\n\nTorres Extra Virgin Olive Oil potato chips had rancid, off-flavors. We also sampled Torres Selecta Mediterranean Sea Salt chips, which tasted bland and stale. But our tasters thought both looked beautiful.\n\nSuperbon Chips de Madrid from Spain and San Carlo Classic Potato Chips from Italy were also bland and stale, with starchy aftertastes.\n\nWe had wanted to try Clover Valley Classic Potato Chips, sold at Dollar General, and Snack Day Original Potato Chips, sold at Aldi, but both were out of stock during our tasting. And chips from Charles Chips arrived too late for us to include them in our test.\n\nKettle-style potato chips\n\nWe liked the toasty, deep-fried flavor and light texture of Clancy\u2019s Original Kettle Chips, which had savory, almost meaty overtones, but we didn\u2019t find them to be as appealing as our top picks.\n\nMost tasters found Zapp\u2019s New Orleans Kettle Style Regular Flavor chips to be nicely crunchy and balanced in flavor, if somewhat average.\n\nGreat Value Kettle Cooked Original Potato Chips were a nice golden brown and very crunchy, with a fried potato flavor similar to that of fast-food french fries. But some found that flavor lingered too long.\n\nA few tasters liked the heavy crunch and savory, oily flavor of Tim\u2019s Cascade Snacks Cascade Style Potato Chips with Sea Salt, but several thought these dark-tan chips had lingering flavors that were borderline unpleasant.\n\nUtz Kettle Classics Original were a little on the oily side but fresh-tasting and light, with good potato flavor. But some thought they were too soft.\n\nMy Dad\u2019s Chips Homestyle Potato Chips were polarizing. Some tasters absolutely loved this chip\u2019s dark russet color, extra saltiness, deep crunch, oily sheen, and toasty, long-fried flavor, especially with dip. Others felt they were a little too salty.\n\nThe darkly fried, oily Good & Gather Kettle Cooked Sea Salt Potato Chips reminded tasters of latkes, but several thought they tasted overcooked, or even slightly bitter.\n\nMiss Vickie\u2019s Sea Salt Chips were also among the darkest chips we tasted. Though they had good flavor and texture, we found them to be too greasy, and some chips tasted stale.\n\nWe did not enjoy Kettle Brand Sea Salt Potato Chips, which tasted stale and even scorched, with a strong aftertaste and unpleasant mouthfeel.\n\nWe appreciated the mission of Uglies Sea Salt Kettle Potato Chips\u2014to use potatoes rejected for use by other chip makers\u2014but did not love the end results. Some chips had unpleasant earthy, stale, or moldy flavors and a strong aftertaste of green potato.\n\nCape Cod Kettle Cooked Potato Chips Original had a sweet-potato flavor and greasy crunch that many liked, but some tasted scorched oil.\n\nMartin\u2019s Kettle Cook\u2019d Hand Cooked Potato Chips are fried in shortening instead of vegetable oil, and our panel did not like their bitter off-flavors and softer texture.\n\nWe mostly liked Dirty Kettle Style Potato Chips, which are golden brown and taste and feel a little oily. The flavor wasn\u2019t hugely potatoey, but the chips were satisfying. Although, a few found they had a slightly unpleasant aftertaste.\n\nKettle-style Pipers Angelsley Sea Salt Crisps were oily yet bland, and undersalted.\n\nWise Snacks New York Deli Kettle Cooked Potato Chips were noticeably harder than other chips, which many tasters didn\u2019t like, and on the oily side. The potato flavor was earthy and toasty, though some tasters detected a stale or even fishy aftertaste.\n\nWe did not like 365 by Whole Foods Market Sea Salt Kettle Chips, which were stale, lacking in flavor, and strangely hard.\n\nWe also did not like Siete Kettle Cooked Potato Chips, which are fried in avocado oil. Tasters noted they tasted like dirt, plastic, or scorched oil, were too soft, and had a bad aftertaste.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s Kettle Cooked Olive Oil Potato Chips also tasted of scorched oil and had an unpleasant buttery aftertaste.\n\nGreat Lakes Potato Chip Co. Kettle Cooked Original Potato Chips had a good flavor and were super crunchy, but some found they had starchy notes that were unpleasant.\n\nHal\u2019s New York Kettle Chips Original Sea Salt were pale and stale, and several chips also had flecks of green potato, which tend to taste bad.\n\nNorth Fork Potato Chips were also small, pale, and stale.\n\nWe did not like Rusty\u2019s Chips Sea Salt Potato Chips. Dark orange, and extremely oily, they tasted stale and were thick and dry.\n\nWe had wanted to taste Clover Valley Original Kettle Potato Chips, sold at Dollar General, but they were out of stock during our tasting.\n\nWavy and rippled chips\n\nTasters thought Ruffles Original had great flavor, a good crunch, and stood up to dipping, but they were not as well-liked as our picks. They\u2019re also very salty.\n\nUtz Ripples Original Potato Chips and Utz Wavy Original Potato Chips were well balanced, with a good salt level, sturdiness, and potato flavor, but some said they were subtler than our picks.\n\nHerr\u2019s Ripples Potato Chips (which have a wider wave) and Herr\u2019s Ridged Potato Chips were also very good, but with a flatter flavor than our pick. Herr\u2019s Kettle Cooked Classic Lattice Cut with Sea Salt potato chips, on the other hand, were too oily and thick.\n\nClancy\u2019s Wavy Potato Chip, made for Aldi supermarkets, had a great texture but were starchy and tasted undercooked.\n\nWe did not like Kirkland Signature Kettle Brand Pink Salt Potato Chips, made for Costco. They were greasy, hard, and bland, and they tasted slightly underdone.\n\nWe did not like Boulder Canyon Classic Sea Salt Kettle Style Potato Chips, which are fried in avocado oil. The oil tasted stale and bitter.\n\nWe had wanted to taste Clover Valley Ripple Cut Potato Chips, sold at Dollar General, and Amazon Fresh Wavy Potato Chips, but both were out of stock during our tasting.",

    "title": "One Bed, Two Blankets: How My Husband and I Stopped Fighting Over the Covers at Night",
    "body": "My husband\u2019s side of the bed (left) and mine (right). He sleeps with a lightweight blanket, while I prefer a heavy comforter. Elissa Sanci/NYT Wirecutter\n\nI admit that I\u2019ve been a cover hog my entire life, but it\u2019s not (totally) my fault. I move a lot in my sleep\u2014which I can\u2019t control\u2014so I\u2019d often swaddle myself in our shared blanket throughout the night, leaving my husband out in the cold. Getting the covers back was never easy for him, and on the nights I went to bed earlier than he did, he\u2019d have to wrestle them free, sometimes waking me in the process.\n\nThe morning I woke up wrapped in our shared comforter, warm and cozy, only to see him shivering under a too-small throw blanket usually reserved for the couch, I felt like an absolute jerk and decided it was time to find a solution. That\u2019s when I finally suggested to my husband that we sleep with separate blankets.\n\nMy husband happily welcomed this new arrangement. We agreed that if we didn\u2019t like the separation and wanted to be under the same blanket again, we\u2019d simply switch back. But after just one night of sleeping the Scandinavian way, we knew we were on to something.\n\n\u201cThe Scandinavian sleeping method allows you to create a sleep environment that works for you,\u201d explains James Wilson, a sleep practitioner and educator based in the UK. This is especially helpful if you and your partner have different body temperatures, as my husband and I do. \u201cAs sleepers, we\u2019re all different, so if we\u2019re trying to buy a comforter that suits everyone in the bed, we often end up with one person being too hot or too cold.\u201d\n\nSleeping Scandi-style solved our temperature differences literally overnight. With the freedom to personalize our respective sides of the bed with bedding that complemented our individual temperatures, we both immediately slept more comfortably. My husband, who runs hot, prefers to sleep in as little as possible, under a paper-thin blanket, while I\u2019d rather wear a full sweatsuit with socks to bed and wrap myself, burrito-style, in a fluffy feather-down comforter. Before adopting the Scandi method, we\u2019d always bicker over the bedding, eventually compromising with a blanket somewhere in the middle that neither of us actually liked. Now, we each sleep exactly how we want with the bedding we prefer.\n\nCreating a sleeping environment that\u2019s right for you in terms of comfort, support, and temperature is likely to improve the quality of your sleep, explains Wilson. It has certainly helped my husband and me sleep more soundly throughout the night, especially now that one of us isn\u2019t left out in the cold night after night.",

    "body": "Some panelists have had positive previous experiences using AmLactin Daily Nourish 12%, one of the few body moisturizers to appear on multiple best-of lists, to help clear their or their children\u2019s keratosis pilaris. But the slippery formula didn\u2019t wow us for everyday use, and some testers experienced a stinging sensation when using it.\n\nAlthough Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion was a top pick in the previous version of this guide, the current crop of panelists said the formula was lighter and less effective than other contenders; most found the hydrating benefits much too short-lived.\n\nWe found Eucerin Intensive Repair, which counts mineral oil as its first ingredient, to be too greasy and unpleasant to use. (We also disliked the smell, which one tester described as reminiscent of old milk.) The same was true for Nivea Essentially Enriched, which had the consistency, look, and feel of an especially greasy sunscreen.\n\nWe\u2019ve used Palmer\u2019s Daily Skin Therapy many times in the past for extra-dry skin needs, but our testers found the consistency too greasy to recommend for everyday use. In addition, the formula tended to sit on, not sink into, flaky skin.\n\nWe were extremely frustrated by the pump dispenser for La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ Triple Repair Moisturizing Cream\u2014the thick formula seemed almost impossible to get out of the bottle.\n\nWe liked the richness and texture of Kiehl\u2019s Creme de Corps but were slightly put off by its smell, color, and oiliness.\n\nWe tested Brazilian Bum Bum Cream based on its rave reviews but found the formula\u2019s hydration to be much too fleeting\u2014and its tub way too small\u2014for any sort of effective daily habit. Similarly, Eos Shea Better 24H Moisture Body Lotion had all the hype (and a great price), but we weren\u2019t wowed by its slightly greasy, less hydrating formula.\n\nAs a luxe option, Fenty Beauty\u2019s Butta Drop Whipped Oil Body Cream was just okay texture-wise, and the scent was too subtle to register after a short while. We found that the similarly priced Josie Maran Whipped Argan Oil Body Butter (which comes in both scented and unscented options) offered a much better experience for the money.\n\nSome testers loved the scent of Weleda Skin Food Body Butter, and some found it overwhelming. Ultimately, it was the butter\u2019s oily top layer and waxy, congealed texture that kept it off our list of picks.\n\nInexpensive mainstays Gold Bond Healing Hydrating Lotion and Jergens Ultra Healing Dry Skin Moisturizer both had formulas that we found too clumpy, and for one tester the Gold Bond pump broke after one use.\n\nBoth CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion (a former runner-up pick) and Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion had formulas that we found too light for remedying dry skin; we preferred the CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Cream formula instead.\n\nFor all of its fancy holographic packaging, we found the thin formula of Olay Collagen Peptide Firming Body Lotion to be extremely underwhelming.\n\nAlthough Tree Hut Vanilla Whipped Shea Body Butter is an inexpensive body butter, we thought its cold, jelly-like texture was unappealing.\n\nThis article was edited by Hannah Morrill and Jennifer Hunter.

    "body": "A humidifier can be a useful tool to support health, said Juanita Mora, a physician and spokesperson for the American Lung Association. \u201cBut we also have to make sure that it\u2019s cleaned at least once a week [and] the water\u2019s changed daily so that we avoid adding more indoor pollutants to our environment by turning on this humidifier,\u201d explained Mora.\n\nWash humidifiers with soap weekly\n\nStaff writer Thom Dunn, who wrote Wirecutter\u2019s guide to the best humidifiers, recommends cleaning the device weekly or any time you notice white scale or film, as well as after pulling it from storage. (That\u2019s why cleaning was a big part of testing humidifiers for our guide.)\n\nSeriously: Do it once a week. This is no laughing matter; the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued an alert about dirty humidifiers and possible health hazards, which can range from \u201cflu-like symptoms to serious infection.\u201d\n\nWe have a whole article about cleaning humidifiers, but soap and water is the safest option, said Maryum Merchant, a pulmonologist at UCLA Health who co-leads the Adult Asthma Program, in a phone interview. She said diluted white vinegar can also be used safely, but she discouraged the use of bleach, even when diluted.\n\nThe CDC states that soap and water are typically sufficient to clean surfaces. If you do use bleach to clean a particularly nasty humidifier, Thom recommends bringing the humidifier outside and running a full tank of water through it after you\u2019ve finished cleaning, to make sure none of the dangerous chemicals stick around.\n\n\u201cDo not use chemical cleaning agents or disinfectants, as they can remain in the humidifier and be volatilized next time the humidifier is used,\u201d said Andrea Dietrich, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who co-authored a paper on humidifier use and indoor air quality.\n\nUse distilled water and change it daily\n\nThe CPSC recommends changing the water in your humidifier once a day. On top of that, as Merchant, Mora, and other experts recommend, you should use distilled water\u2014that is, water without any minerals\u2014in an ultrasonic humidifier. Distilled water excludes tap water, even when it\u2019s been filtered or purified.\n\nThat\u2019s because studies show that when filled with mineral water or tap water, even when it\u2019s been filtered, ultrasonic humidifiers in particular can send small particles of dried minerals, like calcium and magnesium, into the air. Those minerals aren\u2019t inherently harmful (in fact, they\u2019re important nutrients), but they\u2019re not healthy when inhaled into the lungs.\n\n\u201cWhen dried mineral particles containing calcium and magnesium are inhaled into the lungs, this is not good for health, as particles can clog the lung passages, making breathing difficult,\u201d said Dietrich, who co-authored one such study, by email. There is also a risk that the mineral dust could contain metals like arsenic, cadmium, lead, and manganese, she said.\n\n\u201cInhaling particles has worse consequences for children than adults because children inhale a greater volume of air per body weight than adults,\u201d Dietrich said.\n\nIn contrast to ultrasonic humidifiers, steam or evaporative humidifiers circumvent the possibility of aerosolizing minerals\u2014but steam types can pose burn hazards and may not be a good idea if you have young children or pets. And they too need to be cleaned routinely.\n\nMonitor moisture\n\n\u201cDepending on your home, raising the humidity in a room can also lead to growth of microbes,\u201d said Hayley Goldbach, a dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon at Brown University, in an email. \u201cFor someone with asthma, this can be a serious trigger.\u201d\n\nGenerally speaking, optimal humidity levels for your home are between 30% and 50%, said Mora.\n\nThe EPA recommends keeping humidity levels indoors within 50%. If you do use a humidifier regularly, it\u2019s a good idea to monitor your indoor humidity, said Mora; devices that measure this, called hygrometers, are available at hardware stores (we suggest an inexpensive option in our dehumidifier guide).\n\nYou should also take care to keep the area around the humidifier dry, including walls and other vertical surfaces, to prevent mold and mildew growth within building materials, said Jeffrey Siegel, a professor of civil and mineral engineering at the University of Toronto, in a phone interview.\n\nBe cautious with scents\n\nIf you\u2019re in the habit of running your humidifier with essential oils (which some models let you do) or using an essential oil diffuser that relies on mist, here are some things you may want to consider.\n\nResearch on the possible benefits of essential oils is ongoing. But when it comes to scent diffusers, you should proceed with extra caution: Aromatherapy essential oils aren\u2019t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration or the CPSC. Essential oils may emit potentially hazardous VOCs into the air. Experts say you should never use essential oil diffusers around infants under 6 months old; for ages above that, discuss with your doctor what essential oils may be okay to use.\n\nHow much you put into your diffuser, and how much you dilute it, will vary and is hard to measure. And if your space is poorly ventilated (a small bedroom with the windows closed in winter, say), the concentration of oils in the air you breathe can climb quite high, said Merchant.\n\nPeople are still studying the safety of inhaling essential oils long-term. However, one study suggests that heavy exposure, as in several hours a day over many years, could potentially have health effects. More immediately, essential oils might trigger an asthma attack in some individuals, according to the American Lung Association. If you have asthma, it\u2019s a good idea to proceed with caution, as we suggest in our guide to the best essential oil diffusers.\n\nRemember, if you use an essential oil diffuser, clean it regularly, fill it with distilled water, and don\u2019t keep it running on your bedside table as you fall asleep. Let it run for as short a time as possible, and far from your head.\n\nEssential oils can also be hazardous to pets or otherwise impact their health, said Amy Nichelason, a veterinarian and professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in an email. \u201cOverall, I don\u2019t recommend essential oil diffusers, especially in environments where my patients\u201d\u2014that is, dogs and cats\u2014\u201chave any form of respiratory disease like asthma,\u201d she explained. She recommends using them only in areas that your pet can\u2019t access.",

    "body": "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?\n\n20 December 2024 Share Save Mina Al-Lami \u2022 Minalami Chief jihadist media specialist, BBC Monitoring Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nLast week, while touring Damascus, Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa (formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) was approached by a young woman who asked for a photo with him. He gently requested that she cover her hair before taking the picture. The incident quickly sparked heated debate across Arabic social and mainstream media. What happened may have been small but it was telling because it encapsulated the tightrope that Syria's new rulers Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - who are designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, EU and UK - must walk. On one side is the diverse, and, in some cases more liberal, Syrian population, along with the international community, whose acceptance is crucial for HTS's survival and legitimacy. To them, the hair covering incident offered a troubling glimpse into Syria's potential future under HTS, expressing fears that conservative policies could eventually mandate the veil for all women. On the other side, Islamist hardliners criticised al-Sharaa for taking the photo at all, describing the woman as a \"mutabarijah\" - a term for a woman perceived to dress immodestly or wear makeup - and insisting his action violated religious rules. These hardliners hold significant sway over militant factions and could rally opposition within al-Sharaa's own Islamist base. HTS faces the challenge of attempting to reconcile these competing demands - balancing the expectations of the international community and the liberal parts of Syria's population with the demands of the hardline base. Both sides are closely scrutinising HTS's every statement and action.\n\nGetty Images Ahmed al-Sharaa (formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani)\n\nThe group's ability to navigate these tensions will be critical to maintaining control and pursuing its political ambitions. In his messages, he has focused on coexistence within Syria's diverse society, granted amnesty to former military conscripts, prohibited acts of vigilante revenge against ex-government personnel and loyalists, and adopted neutral and at times conciliatory language when addressing traditional adversaries, including Israel, the US, Iran and Russia. His statements have been deliberately devoid of inflammatory rhetoric or threats, instead centring on themes of reconciliation, stability, and reconstruction, in a clear effort to neutralise opposition and push for the removal of HTS and al-Sharaa himself from international terror lists.\n\nSignificant unease\n\nIt is still unclear whether al-Sharaa's flexible approach represents a genuine ideological shift or a calculated strategy aimed at winning approval and consolidating power before potentially implementing a stricter and more religiously conservative agenda. But already his more progressive moves are sparking significant unease among hardliners in Syria, who insist on an Islamist government rooted in a strict and distinctive Sunni identity. While Sunni Arabs are the dominant ethnic and religious group in Syria, the country is notably diverse, with a range of minority groups including Shia Alawites, of which the ousted president Bashar al-Assad is a member, Kurds, Christians, Druze, Turkmen and Ismailis, in addition to other small groups.\n\nReuters Crowds celebrated in Umayyad Square after the removal of Bashar al-Assad\n\nEven if HTS leadership is sincere in its push for change, the diverse range of Islamist and jihadist factions deeply entrenched in Syria - many of which played key roles in the recent offensive - are unlikely to tolerate anything short of a strict Islamist system. Should HTS deviate from such a path, these factions would likely be prepared to resort to armed resistance to enforce their vision. However this is not a new challenge for HTS.\n\nFrom IS to al-Qaeda to HTS\n\nFor a decade the group, formerly known as al-Nusra Front and with roots in transnational jihadist movements, has been evolving. HTS transitioned from being a covert offshoot of the ultra-hardline IS around 2011 and 2012, to being affiliated to the relatively more flexible al-Qaeda the following year, and by 2016 to an independent faction. It consolidated its control of Idlib province in north-west Syria in 2017, running a civilian \"government\" in the area purportedly with no lasting jihadist connections or ambitions. This evolution reflects al-Sharaa's strategic vision and likely incorporates elements of opportunism and pragmatism aimed at ensuring the group's acceptance and long-term survival. HTS's strategy of signalling that it poses no external threat has already borne fruit.\n\nReuters Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) became an independent faction in 2016\n\nWhile its former jihadist partners, al-Qaeda and IS, were heavily targeted in Syria by the US-led coalition - resulting in the routine assassination of their leaders, often in Idlib itself - al-Sharaa has operated with relative freedom. Despite a $10m (\u00a37.8m) US bounty on his head, he has been able to frequently appear publicly, attending events and engaging with the population, much like a statesman. However, al-Sharaa's jihadist critics accuse him of being a manipulative politician, willing to compromise on key ideological principles to advance his own career and secure political gains for HTS, at the expense of other militant groups operating in the country.\n\nHow rebels won hearts and minds\n\nHTS solidified its authority in Idlib through a dual strategy: winning the hearts and minds of local populations through offering some form of stability, while using force to stamp out or co-opt rivals and even former allies. The group moved away from distinctive jihadist rhetoric, fighting for religion, and the establishment of Islamic rule (Sharia) in Syria, as part of a wider interconnected global project. Instead, they adopted a more \"revolutionary\" and nationalist narrative, focusing on the singular goal of toppling Syria's president Bashar al-Assad and \"liberating\" Syria.\n\nReuters Before the HTS-led rebel offensive, the group faced widespread anti-HTS protests\n\nThe civilian front established by HTS in 2017 to administer Idlib was called the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG). The aim was to demonstrate HTS's governance capabilities, and bolster its legitimacy. This move was likely also aimed at alleviating fears about militants running a province, seeking to distance itself from the brutal image associated with IS's rule over territories in Syria and Iraq. The SSG operated as a mini-state, complete with a prime minister, ministries and local departments managing key sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, all while adhering to a religious council guided by Sharia (Islamic law). It also established professional-looking military and police academies, frequently showcasing their graduation ceremonies and organising military parades, typically attended by al-Sharaa. The SSG frequently showcased its achievements in reconstruction and service provision. It often contrasted these efforts with the dire conditions and rampant corruption in areas controlled by the Syrian government or rival rebel groups. Al-Sharaa even twice attended Idlib's annual book fair, giving speeches. But HTS faced significant challenges in Idlib, and its rule was far from smooth. Prior to the 27 November HTS-led rebel offensive, the group was dogged by anti-HTS protests, particularly targeting al-Sharaa's leadership. Protesters accused HTS of suppressing dissent through forced disappearances and imprisonment of opponents and critics.\n\nEPA Syrian rebel fighters celebrated in Hama after the Syrian military withdrew its troops\n\nThe group also faced criticism for allegedly colluding with foreign powers to undermine \"the jihad\" in Syria. In 2023, it was further rocked by a scandal involving spies within its top leadership, and was accused by hardliners of deliberately avoiding meaningful combat against government forces to please unnamed foreign backers. During such protests, al-Sharaa was frequently likened to Assad, while HTS's security apparatus was compared to the \"Shabiha\", Assad's notorious loyalist militia. However, it is important to note that many of HTS's critics, past and present, and some of the those imprisoned by the group, were hardliners actively inciting opposition to HTS's project in Idlib. Others were locals and activists who criticised what they described as HTS's monopolisation of power and \"authoritarian\" rule.\n\nHardliners vs liberals: Religious restrictions\n\nAlthough some locals have voiced complaints about religious restrictions in Idlib, as reported by Arab media and NGOs, these grievances have not been widespread. This may be due to HTS's relative flexibility and the fact that most residents of the province are conservative Sunni Muslims who may be generally accepting of the status quo. Indeed, HTS has often come in for harsh criticism by hardliners for being too \"lenient\" and failing to impose strict Sharia rules in Idlib. Al-Sharaa has argued that the imposition of strict rules such as the morality police is an outdated idea that often causes more harm than good. In April 2023 he said: \"We don't want to create a hypocritical society that prays when we're around and doesn't when we're gone.\" He emphasised that he wanted people to adhere to Islamic teachings out of conviction, \"not through the stick [force]\".\n\nReuters In early 2024, Al-Sharaa's Ministry of Interior established a \"public morality police\"\n\nDespite these comments, the group has often responded by employing strict measures in a clear effort to appease hardliners - a pattern that offers insight into how HTS may respond to such pressures in future. For example, despite dissolving various Hisba (morality police) structures that operated under thinly-veiled names and despite the vocal objections of al-Sharaa himself, the SSG nevertheless established a \"public morality police\" under its Ministry of Interior in early 2024. These morality forces regulated shops, ensured women wore compliant religious clothing and limited the mixing of sexes in public spaces. And a few months earlier, the SSG's Ministry of Education had issued a decree mandating that all female students and staff wear \"loose Islamic dress that complies with Sharia\", which includes covering one's hair and avoiding \"fashion and trends\" deemed \"incompatible with our religious teachings\". The decree also prohibited the mixing of sexes in primary and secondary schools.\n\nOther rebel rivalries\n\nUntil recently, the dominant feature of Syria's opposition groups - whether rebel or jihadist - was disunity and fragmentation, often marked by bouts of infighting. Armed factions competed over territory, revenue sources, authority and ideology. For years, this persistent disunity, among other factors, severely hampered their ability to achieve victory over Assad. The recent rebel unity that led to Assad's downfall remains a relatively new development and could still prove fragile. Also, there are internal challenges still posed by rival factions.\n\nGetty Images HTS has a history of tense relations with Syria's other major rebel groups\n\nHTS has long had a strained relationship with the other major rebel bloc in Syria, the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The SNA's focus during the recent offensive has largely aligned with Ankara's priorities - seizing Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria to eliminate what Turkey perceives as a Kurdish \"threat\" along its borders. Whether the two blocs can agree on the division of the strategic locations seized from Kurdish forces - or across Syria more broadly - remains uncertain, particularly as HTS continues to push for complete unity, clearly under its own leadership. IS, which remains active in Syria through both operatives and sleeper cells, has declared its ongoing jihad in the country and denounced the HTS-led rebel authority as \"apostates\" allegedly brought to power by \"infidel\" forces. With the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) weakening in the northeast, IS is likely to set its sights on the prisons and camps in Hasaka that hold IS-linked fighters and their families. A mass release or escape from these facilities could significantly bolster IS's ranks and ability to destabilise Syria. Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011 - and Assad's brutal crackdown on the uprising - the country has attracted a wide range of foreign fighters, clerics and transnational jihadist groups, facilitated by porous borders, particularly via Turkey.\n\nReuters A man steps on a torn photograph of ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad\n\nTo consolidate its control over Idlib, and possibly as part of deals with foreign powers to contain the jihadist threat in northern Syria, HTS crushed some local and foreign factions and co-opted others, integrating them into its own structures, renaming their units to obscure their foreign origins. These include smaller factions from Central Asia, the Caucasus (Chechens) and China's Uighur minority. Many of these smaller factions, including independent jihadist groups like Ansar al-Islam and Ansar al-Tawhid, actively participated in the latest offensive, which highlights their potential vested interest in shaping the future of the new Syria. In terms of post-Assad messaging, groups like al-Qaeda as well as more moderate Islamist figures and scholars have reminded HTS about its \"obligation\" to ensure the set-up of an Islamic system in Syria, distinguished by a strong Sunni identity.\n\n'Power grab'\n\nWhen asked by a CNN correspondent on 6 December whether HTS intends to impose an Islamic system, al-Sharaa gave a characteristically evasive response. Instead of a direct \"yes\" or \"no\", he stated, \"People who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\" This carefully worded answer suggest that HTS likely plans to implement Islamic governance, but perhaps in a more flexible and nuanced form. But already since HTS toppled the Assad government, ideological tensions have begun to resurface after the initial euphoria and unified effort to achieve a common goal. On 9 December HTS issued a decree granting amnesty to former military conscripts, but hardliners in Syria denounced the move as overly \"lenient\" and inconsistent with Sharia law, going so far as to incite disobedience and call for revenge attacks against ex-government loyalists, directly defying the HTS order.\n\nHTS attempted to quell the uproar by issuing a statement clarifying that it would pursue former government personnel and loyalists implicated in war crimes - an apparent attempt to appease critics. At the same time, HTS sought to reinforce its authority, explicitly vowing to punish anyone who defied its decree by engaging in vigilante revenge. Another point of contention arose on 16 December when al-Sharaa announced plans to disband and disarm militant groups and militias in the country, concentrating weapons in the hands of the state and the military alone. Again, hardliners protested, urging factions to retain their arms. They argued the move would consolidate power under HTS, leaving no other groups armed to challenge its authority and paving the way for tyranny. Further discontent emerged over HTS's muted response to repeated Israeli airstrikes in Syria following Assad's fall. After days of silence, on 14 December al-Sharaa criticised the strikes but stated that his group had no intention of engaging in any new conflicts, emphasising its current focus on rebuilding Syria. He also stated that he would not allow Syria to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.\n\nReuters Some hardliners may take up arms against HTS if it strays from their vision of a religious Syria\n\nSome viewed this stance as weak and a betrayal of Islamist principles. Their frustration was amplified by al-Qaeda's recent message urging HTS to prioritise the fight against Israel and fulfil its \"obligation\" to defend Palestinians in Gaza. These tensions suggest that hardliners - both within HTS ranks and external factions - may be willing to take up arms against the group if they perceive it as straying too far from their vision for a new religious Syria. Many of these individuals and factions are deeply invested in the country and are unlikely to relinquish their ambitions easily. They view Syria, much like Afghanistan under the Taliban, as a project for a strong Sunni Islamic state - one that could wield regional influence while serving as a safe haven for persecuted Muslims and jihadist fugitives. Under pressure from liberals and hardliners alike, al-Sharaa and HTS are treading a fine line in an attempt not to antagonise either side too much and the need for flexibility appears to be key. A week ago the young woman wanting a photo was asked to cover her hair. This week al-Sharaa was photographed with two British diplomats, one of whom was Ann Snow, the UK's special representative for Syria. Her hair was uncovered. Top image credit: Getty",

    "body": "Critics praise Chalamet's portrayal of Bob Dylan\n\n11 December 2024 Share Save Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images Chalamet sings all the songs in the film himself, rather than lip-syncing to the original Dylan recordings\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet has been praised by critics for his portrayal of Bob Dylan, in a new film biopic of the US singer-songwriter. A Complete Unknown has already scored three Golden Globe nominations and is likely to be in the Oscars race in the new year. The Guardian said Chalamet showed \"amazing bravado\" in his performance, while Empire said the actor is \"superb\" and his \"musical talent is unimpeachable\". But the Independent said the biopic itself \"plays too safe\" and Screen Rant described the \"serviceable\" film as a \"fascinating yet frustrating\" portrait.\n\nA Complete Unknown is released on Christmas Day in the US, and 17 January in the UK. Dylan himself has endorsed the film, although he had not actually seen it at the time he posted about it last week on X. \"Timmy's a brilliant actor so I'm sure he's going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me,\" Dylan said.\n\nSearchlight Deadline praised Chalamet's \"remarkable\" portrayal of Dylan\n\nIn her three-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said the film \"takes a reverent stance to Dylan's artistry, populated by technically accomplished musical performances\". She said Chalamet's voice \"isn't perfect, but it's undoubtedly impressive\", adding the film is \"shot with a real sensitivity to the emotional landscape of each track\". The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric! Set in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Dylan's rise to fame, and the conflict between his folk roots and his desire to expand his repertoire to include rock 'n' roll. The friction is represented by the choice between his use of an acoustic and electric guitar, and Dylan's lyrics gradually become bolder and more reflective of the world he sees around him.\n\nGetty Images Dylan, pictured in 2012, said he was \"sure [Chalamet] is going to be completely believable as me\"\n\nThe film climaxes with a famously chaotic performance at at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, where Dylan was booed by some members of the audience for playing an electric set with an amplified band. Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the film's production design, costumes and cinematography, as well as its lead performance. \"At the centre of this all is a remarkable performance by Chalamet, who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lip-syncing or blending of voices between actor and subject,\" he noted. \"The music of course is worth the price of admission, but in Mangold's hands fortunately there is so much more to add, thus making Bob Dylan a little less than complete unknown by the time the credits roll.\" The film also follows Dylan's romantic relationships with two women in particular - civil rights activist Sylvie Russo (played by Elle Fanning) and folk musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).\n\nReuters Chalamet attended the film's LA premiere on Tuesday with co-stars Monica Barbaro and Elle Fanning\n\nScreen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki reflected: \"I could understand both women more clearly than Chalamet's Dylan. Behind his sunglasses and tight body language, Dylan remains elusive. \"The film is very much about an artist who doesn't explain himself, and I have immense respect for that, but it also creates an emotional disconnect in narrative form. It was as though I was watching a series of events that I couldn't bring myself to care about. That's what Mangold risks by keeping Dylan out of reach.\" There was a rave review from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, who awarded the film five stars and praised Chalamet's \"hilarious and seductive portrayal\". \"Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format,\" he said. It's all rise, but troubled and unclear.\" The Times Kevin Maher was far less enthusiastic, awarding just two stars \"There will be audiences who will regard the recreation of Newport '65 as a monumental cinematic event. But for many it will land with a giant shrug of indifference,\" he noted. \"[Chalamet's] performance is an unhelpful study in blank-eyed lockjaw minimalism, while his singing voice is fine if, occasionally, close to parody (but all Dylan imitators sound like parody).\"\n\nSearchlight Dylan's relationship with folk singer Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro) is explored in the film\n\nWith an acclaimed back catalogue built up over seven decades, Dylan is best known for hits such as Blowin in the Wind, Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe, Girl From The North Country and The Times They Are a Changin'. \"Perhaps Dylan himself is too mercurial a figure for a biopic to ever capture him completely,\" wrote the Telegraph's Robbie Collin in a four-star review. \"A Complete Unknown comes about as close as one could reasonably hope. \"For the most part, the film plays like a juicy rise-to-power drama rather than a scenic tour of an artist's Wikipedia page.\" Elsewhere, the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis joked the film made him \"really, really want to learn to play harmonica\". \"It's a defiantly unlikeable performance, miles away from Chalamet's romantic leads,\" Curtis noted. \"He captures Dylan's craning stance and the way he used hair and sunglasses as a mask, the insistent buzz and keen of his speaking and singing voice and the odd, touchy, insularity.\" A Complete Unknown also stars Edward Norton and is directed by James Mangold, the filmmaker behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line and films in the X-Men and Indiana Jones franchises.\n\nSearchlight The film is directed by James Mangold, who was also behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line",

The 67-year-old science journalist went missing in June after going for a walk on the Greek island of Symi. His disappearance sparked a high-profile search effort by emergency services and his body was found after four days. In written findings, senior coroner for Buckinghamshire Crispin Butler said the cause of Dr Mosley's death was \"indeterminate\" and \"unascertainable\" - and \"was most likely attributable either to heatstroke (accidental) or non-identified pathological cause\".\n\nMr Butler said Dr Mosley's death was not found to be as a result of homicide, suicide, or an accident related to injuries. An open conclusion by a coroner means there is insufficient evidence to decide how a death came about - the case is left open in case further evidence comes to light. Dr Mosley, a broadcaster for almost 20 years, known for programmes that focused on diet, exercise and medicine, had been staying with family and friends when they travelled to Pedi Beach on the morning of 5 June, a findings document said.

    "title": "Royal Christmas cards: What are they trying to tell us?",
    "body": "What are royal Christmas cards trying to tell us?\n\n21 December 2024 Share Save Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Share Save\n\nKensington Palace Prince William and Catherine used a picture of their family together in Norfolk\n\nIt's become a seasonal tradition to seek the hidden message or symbolic meaning in the Christmas cards the royals send out, as they keep changing and reinventing the format. This year's card from King Charles and Queen Camilla shows them looking relaxed and maybe relieved - and there is a very personal significance behind this picture. It was the first photoshoot after the King was given the green light that he was well enough to return to public duties, after beginning his cancer treatment. It was said to be a watershed moment for the couple, caught on camera. The same pictures, with images full of spring rebirth, were then used for the official announcement that the King had made sufficient progress with his treatment to go back to public events. The lack of snowy steeples and robins isn't a surprise, as royal Christmas cards rarely seem to show any signs of winter. And the message, printed in red, always looks like a party invitation from the 1950s. Prince Harry and Meghan have given their own twist to royal cards. They've added some glitz, so that it has the feel of film credits as much as a season's greeting.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan's card included pictures of their children\n\nIt's an upbeat Californian message, sent out as an e-card, with six pictures rather than a single image, showing the couple hugging and laughing. It also drew comments on the rare appearance of their son and daughter. If cards could have an accent, this would undoubtedly sound American. It's a \"Happy Holiday Season\", with no mention of \"Christmas\". But then, they've spent most of their married life in the US.\n\nPA Media This year's card from the King and Queen had a very personal connection\n\nPrince William and Catherine's cards have used more informal pictures in recent years. It's jeans and no ties, a modern family, without any royal imagery. This year's card kept the same relaxed style, but it had a very poignant significance. It was from the video that announced that Catherine had completed her chemotherapy. It shows William and Catherine and their three children in Norfolk in August, from a video that was full of end-of-summer colours and very emotional messages about a tough year since her cancer diagnosis. It was a strikingly different style of royal communication, unashamedly about love and togetherness - and they've used it again for the Christmas card.\n\nPA Media Last year's card echoed the informal, no-jackets-and-ties style\n\nLast year's card from the Prince and Princess of Wales had also been a talking point. It featured the same jackets-off, casual image, but there was also a designer chic, with an arty black-and-white picture that wouldn't have looked out of place in an upmarket jeans advert. The prince is very keen on sustainability, so maybe next year's will be made out of recyclable seaweed. Christmas cards can also be like time capsules, holding a moment. In 1995 Prince William appeared alongside his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, and his brother Prince Harry in this rather haunting image. It really evokes another era.\n\nDiana's card from 1995 captured a moment in time\n\nThere's often a sense of family closeness projected by the cards. The late Queen Elizabeth II was always pictured with Prince Philip. And King Charles and Queen Camilla have continued to use images of themselves as a couple. That's had to be mixed up with some props over the years. For the 2019 card the then Prince Charles and Camilla were pictured in a vintage sports car, in a photo taken on a trip to Cuba. It was more or less made for a Prince of Wheels headline.\n\nGetty Images The cards have always emphasised family, but have experimented with the settings\n\nPA Media The royals gathered around a speed boat in this 1969 Christmas card\n\nThere was also a picture of the Royal Family standing around a speed boat in 1969, looking like winners on a game show.\n\nBelgian royals take a traditional approach to their Christmas card\n\nChristmas cards might be slipping out of fashion - sales of boxes of cards are down 23% in a year, according to retailers John Lewis. But the royals show no sign of losing interest - and that includes European royal families... although their use of a family group in a posh room isn't always that original. The Belgian royal card has a multi-lingual message, which is inclusive and reflects a multi-lingual country, but risks looking like a Eurostar menu. It's also unusually forward-looking, with the date of 2025.\n\nPA Media The Spanish royals used their card to address grievances over this year's floods\n\nSpanish royals this year used their card to send a more serious message. There was a standard family group photo on the front, but inside was a poem that was a tribute to the victims of the Valencia flood. Last month, Spain's king and queen had been pelted with mud when they visited areas hit by the floods.\n\nPA Media Christmas cards don't always conform to what's expected\n\nYou couldn't say that the Christmas card pictures are always predictable or easy to interpret.

    "clean_body": "what are royal christmas cards trying to tell us 21 december 2024 share save sean coughlan royal correspondent share save kensington palace prince william and catherine used a picture of their family together in norfolk its become a seasonal tradition to seek the hidden message or symbolic meaning in the christmas cards the royals send out as they keep changing and reinventing the format this years card from king charles and queen camilla shows them looking relaxed and maybe relieved and there is a very personal significance behind this picture it was the first photoshoot after the king was given the green light that he was well enough to return to public duties after beginning his cancer treatment it was said to be a watershed moment for the couple caught on camera the same pictures with images full of spring rebirth were then used for the official announcement that the king had made sufficient progress with his treatment to go back to public events the lack of snowy steeples and robins isnt a surprise as royal christmas cards rarely seem to show any signs of winter and the message printed in red always looks like a party invitation from the 1950s prince harry and meghan have given their own twist to royal cards theyve added some glitz so that it has the feel of film credits as much as a seasons greeting prince harry and meghans card included pictures of their children its an upbeat californian message sent out as an ecard with six pictures rather than a single image showing the couple hugging and laughing it also drew comments on the rare appearance of their son and daughter if cards could have an accent this would undoubtedly sound american its a happy holiday season with no mention of christmas but then theyve spent most of their married life in the us pa media this years card from the king and queen had a very personal connection prince william and catherines cards have used more informal pictures in recent years its jeans and no ties a modern family without any royal imagery this years card kept the same relaxed style but it had a very poignant significance it was from the video that announced that catherine had completed her chemotherapy it shows william and catherine and their three children in norfolk in august from a video that was full of endofsummer colours and very emotional messages about a tough year since her cancer diagnosis it was a strikingly different style of royal communication unashamedly about love and togetherness and theyve used it again for the christmas card pa media last years card echoed the informal nojacketsandties style last years card from the prince and princess of wales had also been a talking point it featured the same jacketsoff casual image but there was also a designer chic with an arty blackandwhite picture that wouldnt have looked out of place in an upmarket jeans advert the prince is very keen on sustainability so maybe next years will be made out of recyclable seaweed christmas cards can also be like time capsules holding a moment in 1995 prince william appeared alongside his mother diana princess of wales and his brother prince harry in this rather haunting image it really evokes another era dianas card from 1995 captured a moment in time theres often a sense of family closeness projected by the cards the late queen elizabeth ii was always pictured with prince philip and king charles and queen camilla have continued to use images of themselves as a couple thats had to be mixed up with some props over the years for the 2019 card the then prince charles and camilla were pictured in a vintage sports car in a photo taken on a trip to cuba it was more or less made for a prince of wheels headline getty images the cards have always emphasised family but have experimented with the settings pa media the royals gathered around a speed boat in this 1969 christmas card there was also a picture of the royal family standing around a speed boat in 1969 looking like winners on a game show belgian royals take a traditional approach to their christmas card christmas cards might be slipping out of fashion sales of boxes of cards are down 23 in a year according to retailers john lewis but the royals show no sign of losing interest and that includes european royal families although their use of a family group in a posh room isnt always that original the belgian royal card has a multilingual message which is inclusive and reflects a multilingual country but risks looking like a eurostar menu its also unusually forwardlooking with the date of 2025 pa media the spanish royals used their card to address grievances over this years floods spanish royals this year used their card to send a more serious message there was a standard family group photo on the front but inside was a poem that was a tribute to the victims of the valencia flood last month spains king and queen had been pelted with mud when they visited areas hit by the floods pa media christmas cards dont always conform to whats expected you couldnt say that the christmas card pictures are always predictable or easy to interpret what was the thinking behind the 2016 card which used a photo of prince charles and camilla on a trip to croatia an unexpected eurovision entry getty images a wartime christmas card sent by a young princess elizabeth",

    "body": "Estonia navy to protect undersea power link after main cable damaged\n\n27 December 2024 Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Share Save\n\nEstonian military The patrol boat Raju's main task will be to protect the Estlink 1 power cable\n\nNato has said it will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea, and Estonia has sent a patrol ship to protect its Estlink1 undersea power cable, after Russia was accused of sabotaging its main power link in the Gulf of Finland. A ship named as Eagle S is suspected of damaging the Estlink 2 cable and Finnish coast guard crew have boarded the oil tanker and steered it into Finnish waters. The EU said the Eagle S was part of \"Russia's shadow fleet\" and the failure of the undersea cable was the \"latest in a series of suspected attacks on critical infrastructure\". Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said the Raju had set sail early on Friday and he believed Finland would join the operation to protect the remaining cable.\n\nHe told Estonian public radio that the Raju's task was \"to ensure that nothing happens there and that our critical connection with Finland remains operational\". The Kremlin has declined to comment on the damage to the cable, describing it as a \"very narrow issue\" and not an issue for the Russian presidency. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte said on social media that he had spoken to Finland's president, Alexander Stubb, adding that Nato would boost its presence in the Baltic. A further statement by the alliance said only that \"Nato remains vigilant and is working to provide further support\". Finland and Estonia are both Nato members and Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal told public TV that, if necessary, they would invoke Article 4 of the Nato Treaty, which involves consultation if any member state feels threatened. \"Our wish would be to receive reinforcements from Nato in the form of a fleet to act as a deterrent,\" he was quoted as saying by news agency BNS. Estonia's power supply has been dramatically reduced after its 170km (105-mile) Estlink 2 cable was shut down. In its initial assessment on Thursday, Finland's Fingrid company said repairs to the cable could last until the end of July 2025. The damage to Estlink 2 is the third incident in little more than a month in the Baltic Sea.\n\nLast month, two data cables were severed: the Arelion cable between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania on 17 November, and then the C-Lion 1 cable was damaged between the Finnish capital, Helsinki, and the German port of Rostock. A Chinese ship, the Yi Peng 3, was suspected of dragging its anchor over the cables in a separate act of Russian sabotage. In October 2023, another Chinese ship ruptured an undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia. The Yi Peng 3 and Eagle S are both suspected of being part of a so-called shadow fleet of oil tankers that Russia is using to avoid Western sanctions imposed since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock The Yi Peng 3 eventually set sail from the Kattegat strait last week",

Derek Heggie made two \"ill-informed and potentially dangerous\" YouTube videos between 2 and 8 August, Carlisle Crown Court heard. The 41-year-old, of Welsh Road in Harraby, Carlisle, admitted sending communication of an offensive nature earlier this month. Jailing him for 10 months and two weeks, Judge Nicholas Barker said it was clear that Heggie had wanted his offensive comments about the Muslim faith \"to be read and heard by many\".\n\nThe killings of three children on 29 July in Southport triggered waves of unrest across the country. Heggie, who described himself as an actor and podcast host, was one of several people in north and west Cumbria to be prosecuted for the use of inflammatory online content. Prosecutor Tim Evans said the posts were \"in whole or in part of an offensive nature\". He said that one of Heggie's videos had had almost 500,000 views and that they could be circulated to people who did not subscribe to them.\n\nTime of unrest\n\nThe court heard that the defendant had 32 previous convictions including assaulting a police officer and a racially aggravated public order offence. Tariq Khawam, defending, said: \"He knows what he did was wrong, ill-informed and potentially dangerous.\" Addressing Heggie, Judge Barker said: \"What was clear in your mind was that these statements were to have a broad reach and to be read and heard by many. \"You did this at a time of great unrest and concern. \"It is clear the messages were intended to be grossly offensive, particularly to those of a Muslim faith,\" the judge added.\n\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "title": "Golden Globes 2025: Ariana Grande, Nicole Kidman and Timothee Chalamet among nominees",
    "body": "Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Timothee Chalamet up for Golden Globes\n\n9 December 2024 Share Save Ian Youngs Culture reporter Share Save\n\nReuters Ariana Grande has been entered in the supporting actress categories, while Cynthia Erivo is classed as Wicked's lead actress\n\nWicked's Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are among the stars who have scored nominations for the Golden Globes, as the Hollywood award season kicks off in earnest. British actress Erivo is shortlisted for best female actor in a comedy or musical film for her role as Elphaba, while co-star Grande is in the running for best supporting female actor for playing Glinda. Angelina Jolie, Hugh Grant, Timothee Chalamet, Sebastian Stan, Demi Moore, Pamela Anderson, Kate Winslet and Selena Gomez are among the other big names in contention. The Golden Globes have been through controversy in recent years but remain the first major awards in the film calendar, and provide pointers for who could do well at next year's Oscars.\n\nNetflix musical Emilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, leads the nominations overall with 10, including one for Gomez. Other prominent films include heavyweight dramas The Brutalist, about a Hungarian architect who tries to build a new life in the US after World War Two, and Conclave, about a group of scheming cardinals who gather to select the new Pope.\n\nNetflix Selena Gomez (centre) has two acting nominations this year\n\nThe top film nominees: Emilia Perez - 10\n\nThe Brutalist - 7\n\nConclave - 6\n\nAnora - 5\n\nThe Substance - 5 Unlike the Oscars, the Golden Globes also have awards for TV shows, with The Bear, Only Murders in the Building, Shogun and Baby Reindeer the main contenders in those categories.\n\nOscar contenders\n\nJolie is the frontrunner to win best female actor in a drama film for playing legendary opera singer Maria Callas in Maria. She will face competition from Nicole Kidman for Babygirl, as well as Anderson for playing a veteran Las Vegas showgirl in The Last Showgirl. British stars Winslet and Tilda Swinton are also in that category, as is Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres. Winslet has two nominations in total - one on the film side for playing war photographer Lee Miller in Lee, and one for portraying a fictional dictator in her TV show The Regime.\n\nUniversal Pictures Adrien Brody is a strong contender for his performance in The Brutalist\n\nIn the race for best male actor in a drama film, The Brutalist's Adrien Brody and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes are seen as the main contenders. Meanwhile, Stan is nominated for playing Donald Trump in The Apprentice, about the incoming US president's early years, and Chalamet is recognised for portraying singer Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown. They are joined on the shortlist by former James Bond star Daniel Craig for playing a US expat in 1950s South America in Queer, and Colman Domingo for his role in Sing Sing, about a prison theatre group. All will also have a shot of receiving Oscar nominations when they are announced in January.\n\nNewcomers and veterans\n\nUnlike the Oscars, the Golden Globe split most of their categories in two, with one award for dramas and a separate prize for musicals/comedies. Newcomer Mikey Madison is hotly tipped for the award for best female actor in a musical/comedy film for playing a New York stripper who falls for the son of a Russian oligarch in Anora. She will take on others including Demi Moore, who has won praise for her role as a veteran Hollywood star who goes to extreme lengths to recapture her youth in body horror The Substance. It is Moore's first nomination for 28 years.\n\nNeon US actress Mikey Madison (right) scored her first Globe nomination for Anora\n\nZendaya, Amy Adams and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n are in the same category, as is Erivo, one of four nominations in total for Wicked. The film, based on the Broadway musical about the origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West from the Wizard of Oz, will hope to combine awards acclaim with commercial success after making $455m (\u00a3356m) so far at the box office. Grande will go up against fellow singer and former children's TV star Gomez, who plays the wife of the drug lord in Emilia P\u00e9rez. Gomez is a double nominee, also being shortlisted for TV comedy Only Murders in the Building.\n\nBritish talent\n\nA number of British stars have made it on to the shortlists. Grant has the seventh Golden Globe nomination of his career, for horror film Heretic, while Felicity Jones has her second for The Brutalist, a decade after her first for The Theory of Everything. Her co-star in the latter, Eddie Redmayne, is also hoping for a Golden Globe this year, for his TV show The Day of the Jackal. He will go up against Gary Oldman for Slow Horses, while his co-star Jack Lowden is listed in one of the supporting categories.\n\nPA Media Keira Knightley attended the premiere of Black Doves in London last week\n\nElsewhere, Keira Knightley is nominated for her new spy drama Black Doves. Her competitors include Emma D'Arcy, who has House of the Dragon's only citation. Richard Gadd stands a strong chance of winning best male actor in a limited series for Baby Reindeer. His rivals include fellow Scot Ewan McGregor, for A Gentleman in Moscow. Baby Reindeer's Jessica Gunning is in the running for best supporting female TV actor. Pop star Robbie Williams is up for the best song award for Forbidden Road, from his forthcoming film biopic Better Man, along with his co-writers Sacha Skarbek and Freddy Wexler. Wallace and Gromit are in the best animated motion picture category for their new film Vengeance Most Fowl, ahead of its premiere on the BBC on Christmas Day.

    "body": "Blake Lively accuses co-star Justin Baldoni of smear campaign\n\n21 December 2024 Share Save Malu Cursino BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nBlake Lively has filed a legal complaint against It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment and a campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation. According to the legal filing, she accuses Mr Baldoni and his team of attacking her public image following a meeting in which she brought along her actor husband, Ryan Reynolds, to address \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Mr Baldoni and a producer on the movie. Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met. In the romantic drama, Ms Lively plays a woman who finds herself in a relationship with a charming but abusive boyfriend, played by Mr Baldoni.\n\nThe meeting between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni, together with others involved in the movie's production, took place on 4 January this year, and it aimed to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set, says the legal filing. Ms Lively's husband, Deadpool star Mr Reynolds, who did not appear in It Ends With Us, joined her at the showdown, according to the legal complaint, which is one step before a lawsuit. Mr Baldoni, 40, attended the meeting in his capacity as co-chairman and co-founder of the company that produced the film, Wayfarer Studios. He was also the film's director. In the legal complaint, Ms Lively's lawyers allege that both Mr Baldoni and the Wayfarer chief executive officer, Jamey Heath, engaged in \"inappropriate and unwelcome behavior towards Ms Lively and others on the set of It Ends With Us\". In the filing to the California Civil Rights Department, a list of 30 demands relating to the pair's alleged misconduct was made at the meeting to ensure they could continue to produce the film. Among them, Ms Lively, 37, requested that there be no more mention of Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath's previous \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively or to other crew members, no more descriptions of their own genitalia to Ms Lively, and \"no more adding of sex scenes, oral sex, or on camera climaxing by BL [Blake Lively] outside the scope of the script BL approved when signing onto the project\", says the complaint. Ms Lively also demanded that Mr Baldoni stop saying he could speak to her dead father.\n\nJose Perez/Bauer-Griffin via Getty Images It Ends With Us has sparked some controversy over how the film depicts domestic violence\n\nMs Lively's legal team further accuse Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios of leading a \"multi-tiered plan\" to wreck her reputation. She alleges this was \"the intended result of a carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others from speaking out about the hostile environment that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath created\". Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\" Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\". He alleged that Ms Lively's claims were \"intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media\". In a statement via her attorneys to the BBC, Ms Lively said: \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\" She also denied that she or any of her representatives had planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer.\n\nThe film was a box-office hit, although some critics said it romanticised domestic violence. Soon after the release date in August, another co-star, Brandon Sklenar, hinted in an Instagram post at rumours of a rift between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni. Speculation of a falling out only grew when they did not appear together on the red carpet. It Ends With Us tells the story of Boston florist Lily Bloom, played by Ms Lively, as she navigates a love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend, Ryle Kincaid, played by Mr Baldoni, and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan, played by Mr Sklenar. It is based on a best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover. The 45-year-old author has previously said her inspiration was domestic abuse her mother endured.\n\nGetty Images Lively posed for photos with Sklenar (left) and her husband Ryan Reynolds at the premiere, but not her co-star Baldoni",

    "body": "Russia is executing more and more Ukrainian prisoners of war\n\n22 December 2024 Share Save Vitaliy Shevchenko BBC Monitoring Russia editor Share Save\n\nFacebook Oleksandr Matsievsky is now an iconic figure in Ukraine after his execution by Russian forces\n\nUkrainian sniper Oleksandr Matsievsky was captured by Russians in the first year of the full-scale invasion. Later, a video emerged showing him smoking his last cigarette in a forest, apparently next to a grave he had been forced to dig. \"Glory to Ukraine!\" he says to his captors. Moments later, shots ring out and he falls dead. His execution is one of many. In October this year, nine captured Ukrainian soldiers were reportedly shot dead by Russian forces in Kursk region. Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating the case including a photo showing half-naked bodies lying on the ground. This photo was enough for one of the victims, drone operator Ruslan Holubenko, to be identified by his parents. \"I recognised him by his underwear,\" his distraught mother told local broadcaster Suspilne Chernihiv. \"I bought it for him before a trip to the sea. I also knew that his shoulder had been shot through. You could see that in the picture.\" The list of executions goes on. Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating reports of beheadings and a sword being used to kill a Ukrainian soldier with his hands tied behind his back. In another instance, a video showed 16 Ukrainian soldiers apparently being lined up and then mowed down with automatic gunfire after emerging from a woods to surrender.\n\nGetty Images Russia and Ukraine have released some prisoners, including this Ukrainian pictured after his release in September 2024\n\nSome of the executions were filmed by Russian forces themselves, while others were observed by Ukrainian drones hovering above. The killings captured on such videos usually take place in woods or fields lacking distinctive features, which makes confirming their exact location difficult. BBC Verify, however, has been able to confirm in several cases - such as one beheading - that the victims wear Ukrainian uniforms and that the videos are recent.\n\nRising numbers\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecution service says that at least 147 Ukrainian prisoners of war have been executed by Russian forces since the start of the full-scale invasion, 127 of them this year. \"The upward trend is very clear, very obvious,\" says Yuri Belousov, the head of the War Department at the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office. \"Executions became systemic from November last year and have continued throughout all of this year. Sadly, their number has been particularly on the rise this summer and autumn. This tells us that they are not isolated cases. They are happening across vast areas and they have clear signs of being part of a policy - there is evidence that instructions to this effect are being issued.\" International humanitarian law - particularly the Third Geneva Convention - offers protection to prisoners of war, and executing them is a war crime.

    "title": "Lauren Mayberry of Chvrches: 'I twisted myself into a pretzel to please people'",
    "body": "Lauren Mayberry of Chvrches: I was always trying to make everyone happy\n\n6 December 2024 Share Save Mark Savage Music correspondent Share Save\n\nBBC Lauren Mayberry: \"A song can have terrible production but a great story, and I'll listen to that all the live long day\"\n\nLauren Mayberry is a peacemaker. Since 2011, she's been frontwoman of the Glaswegian band Chvrches, topping festival bills and the album charts with a trademark barrage of distorted synths and razor-sharp melodies. Mayberry was the baby of the band - just 23 when she joined, and years younger than her bandmates, Iain Cook and Martin Doherty. But their chemistry was instant. Chvrches' debut single, The Mother We Share, was written and recorded in 48 hours, using the only three synths they owned - but it became a word of mouth hit, earning them airplay on BBC Radio 1 and support slots with Passion Pit and Depeche Mode. In the press, they carefully presented themselves as a band, with each member receiving equal billing. But Mayberry says she worried about being the junior partner. \"I was always conscious that I was younger than the other guys, and they had a lot more experience,\" she says. \"They\u2019d been to music school, and I hadn't. So I always felt like I was on the back foot, in terms of where I sat in the hierarchy.\" That feeling was amplified during a 2019 tour of Australia. The itinerary gave the band a four-day break in Melbourne, and Mayberry was looking forward to spending the downtime with her bandmates and the crew - until she discovered they'd made separate plans and she was stranded in her hotel room. \"I remember being very upset and hurt by that because I was always worrying about everyone else and taking care of everybody, and it was a humbling moment,\" she says. \"In the end, I hired a little car and drove to an Australian spa town and had a wee cry listening to Taylor Swift\u2019s Cruel Summer.\" Looking back, she thinks that being the only woman in the touring party left her carrying the \"emotional labour\" of keeping the show on the road. \"I feel like I twisted myself into a pretzel sometimes to make everyone happy. \"Then I\u2019d look back and think, \u2018And were you happy?' \"Not really, but I was keeping the peace.\"\n\nCharlotte Patmore The singer's debut album is titled Vicious Creature after a lyric she'd written years ago: \"Nostalgia is such a vicious creature / Another way to say that you fear the future\"\n\nShe considered leaving the band after that Australian incident. Then Covid struck, and Chvrches ended up making a fourth album, 2021's Screen Violence, remotely. She finally took the plunge a year later, but not before signing a new record deal with her bandmates, assuring the future of the project. \"I was conscious it would give people a sense of security, that I\u2019d made a commitment,\" she says. \"I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s how it actually works, but that was my hope.\" She\u2019s keen to stress there\u2019s no bad blood: Doherty and Cook have given her their full support. Still, it\u2019s natural for someone leaving a band to define themselves in opposition to that music - otherwise what\u2019s the point? As Mayberry succinctly puts it: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a crap knock-off Chvrches record.\u201d In recording sessions, she'd flinch when anyone pulled out a vintage synth. Instead, she pursued a more organic, lyrics-first approach. But after a decade in a trio, the instinct to compromise was hard-wired. \u201cI'm very used to arguing my point, then trying to see other people's point of view,\" she says. \"So it was a real learning curve to be like, \u2018No, this is my opinion, and if I don't think it's right, then it's not right, and that's the end of the conversation'.\u201d\n\nCrying wolf\n\nThe result is Vicious Creature, an album that showcases new depths to Mayberry\u2018s voice, which fluctuates between vulnerability and venom, while paying homage to her pop heroines. She channels the spirit of All Saints on the album opener Something In The Air; and borrows the choppy, sampled strings of Annie Lennox's Walking On Broken Glass to power the single Crocodile Tears. The latter is a furious riposte to an emotionally manipulative man, where Mayberry snarls: \u201cWhat a man will say just to get his way / Always crying wolf, so I\u2019m sad to say / I don\u2019t really wanna hear it from you, babe\". The singer says she's role-playing in that song, inspired by the dark, subversive femininity of Velma Kelly in the musical Chicago, or Cabaret's Sally Bowles. Listen to Lauren Mayberry on BBC Radio 4's Front Row It's one of several songs that survived the first incarnation of the album - tentatively titled Fiction - that would be \"dark, theatrical and character driven\". Slowly, over time, more personal songs started to creep into the mix. The syncopated pulse of Change Shapes is a condemnation of music industry sexism (\"I'm a doll inside a box, with a ball and a chain\"). Sorry, Etc tells a similar story over a chaotic hybrid of garage rock and drum & bass. \"There were definitely a few songs where it was at best expressing frustrations and at worst [feeling] kind of hurt,\" about her life in music, Mayberry says.\n\nChvrches playing at the BBC Maida Vale studios in 2013 (L-R): Martin Doherty, Lauren Mayberry and Iain Cook\n\nThe album's most intimate moment is a muted piano ballad called Oh, Mother. Over three verses, Mayberry documents the shifting relationship with her mother - from the unquestioning love of childhood to adolescent disgust and, finally, the realisation that their time together is limited. \"It kills me to know you won't be around,\" she sings gently. \"Oh mother, what will I do without you?\" The last song written for the record, the words poured out after Mayberry's friend and co-writer Dan McDougall sketched out the chords in the studio. Discussing the lyrics, which were inspired by a family illness, the singer becomes a little emotional. \"When you're living in the shadow of things like that, it's on your mind all the time,\" she says. \"I think about it all the time. When I go away on tour, I always think, \u2018Oh, is this the tour where I'm gone and I miss it\u2019. \"So that last afternoon in the studio was quite a weepy one... But then we went to Nando's. So it's all about balance.\"\n\nGetty Images The singer previewed her debut album on tour with Bleachers and London Grammar, along with smaller solo shows, earlier this year",

Taylor played the \"Black Ball Final\" of 1985 in Sheffield, in a match seen by 19 million people on BBC 2 that lasted until gone midnight. The match remains the channel's highest-rated show, and saw Taylor go cue-to-cue with Davis, who had won the title three times. Inevitably, Davis was favourite to win again, and had taken a seven frames lead. But Taylor - famed for his \"upside down\" glasses - made a miraculous comeback and potted the final black to win the match.\n\nIt provided the sport with the iconic moment of Taylor, wearing those glasses and raising his cue above his head, in celebration. He will appear at the Victoria Hall in Hanley for a show as part of a tour alongside Steve Davis and host John Virgo. The pair will recreate the classic match and also chat with audience members on the night.\n\nSteve Davis and Dennis Taylor will re-create their classic match from 1985\n\n\"John usually gets a couple of people out to do a few trick shots, then Steve and me play a couple of frames, then of course we re-enact that black ball final with the last few colours,\" Taylor said. \"Steve's very amusing about it as well, and the amazing thing about it is we re-enact that black ball final and I get to win every night.\" Taylor said during the second half of the show, they each do their \"own little bit\" \u2013 adding that Davis is \"very funny\" despite his previous reputation for seriousness. \"He was very, very serious when he was playing, he was very focussed - but he's so much fun. I love working with him,\" Taylor continued. \"The three of us interact with the audience and have a lot of fun.\" He said people still come up to him to talk about that night in 1985, and to take photos with him \u2013 adding that sometimes people turn their own glasses upside down. \"It's something that they all remember, they remember where they were when Steve and me were battling it out,\" he said.\n\nMindhouse Productions Taylor says people come up to him and turn their glasses upside down for a photo with him\n\n\"To keep nearly 19 million people up past midnight, watching a fella with ginger hair playing another fella with a big pair of upside down glasses, it's amazing how it captured everybody's imagination. \"Steve says he'll remember that final more than the six that he won.\" Taylor says they were involved in a \"bit of snooker history\", although at the time they had no idea how many people who might have been tuning in. \"If we'd ever thought there was that many people watching I don't think we'd have been able to hold the cue,\" he said. \"The audience kept building, and the BBC were cancelling programmes to stay with it, and it just built and built. \"The pressure on both of us was unbelievable, but we weren't thinking, we were just concentrating on the game.\"\n\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "body": "Robbie Williams on why he's played by a chimp in new film\n\n16 December 2024 Share Save Colin Paterson Entertainment correspondent Share Save\n\nEntertainment Robbie WIlliams is portrayed by a chimpanzee in the new biopic Better Man\n\nRobbie Williams is thoroughly enjoying his wander into the world of film, even if he is still learning the correct lingo. \"I was at this thing called the Governors' Ball the other night. That was amazing,\" the singer says. He is talking about the Governors' Awards, held in Los Angeles, where he joined other guests including Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig. \"I'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. I feel like an artist that's just been signed. I'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.\" The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man. \"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\"\n\nTony Dolce/BBC\n\nBetter Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two). The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey. At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail. To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party.\n\nEntertainment Better Man has been nominated for best song at the Golden Globes\n\nWilliams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence. Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman. Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey.\n\nMike Marsland/WireImage Take Hat! Better Man's director Michael Gracey at the film's European premiere in London\n\nFor a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life. \"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens. \"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'. \"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself. \"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\" Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.' \"I went, 'Monkey?' \"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\"\n\nEntertainment Jonno Davies plays Robbie Williams and provides his speaking voice, although the real Robbie Williams does the singing and a voiceover\n\nThe monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters. But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey. \"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear. \"There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.' \"And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'\"\n\nMe and My Monkey\n\nWilliams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022. \"We also scanned his eyes,\" explains Gracey, \"So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.\" \"I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,\" interrupts Williams. \"I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film. \"Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic.\"\n\nGetty Images Former All Saint Nicole Appleton attended the premiere of Better Man\n\nRobbie Williams sums up Better Man as \"the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation\". And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion. \"My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,\" Williams admits. \"She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend.\"\n\nChimp off the old block\n\nAppleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years. In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family. \"He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,\" says Williams. \"I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man. \"But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up.\"\n\nEntertainment The chimp version of Williams pictured in the film singing alongside his dad, played by Steve Pemberton\n\nThe film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That. \"There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,\" is his summary. \"I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.\" The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after. \"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says. \"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\" But these plans will have to wait.\n\nReuters In 2010 Robbie Williams mentored Liam Payne on The X Factor, when he was starting out in One Direction",

    "title": "Meet Karol G, Colombia's Taylor Swift",
    "body": "Meet Karol G, Colombia's Taylor Swift\n\n12 December 2024 Share Save Catherine Ellis Business reporter Reporting from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia Share Save\n\nGetty Images Karol G had four sold out shows at Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium this summer\n\nWe have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G? While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online. That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024. This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.\n\nSo who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year? Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005. Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it. While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked. She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed. Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.\n\nSmirnoff Karol G has a number of endorsement deals\n\nKarol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish. While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos. \"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world. \"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"\n\nToday on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%. Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this. And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.\n\nThis helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist. Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event. \"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds. Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map. \"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top. \"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.\n\nDespite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism.

    "body": "Magdeburg attack offers far right fertile ground despite suspect's backing for AfD\n\n24 December 2024 Share Save Bethany Bell BBC News in Magdeburg Share Save\n\nGetty Images Stallholders have been allowed back into the Christmas market after the attack\n\n\"I feel bad, I still do,\" said Eidwicht, as she stood in the Christmas market close to the spot where the car sped through on Friday, killing five people and injuring more than two hundred others. \"My granddaughter was here. I rang her because my daughter told me that something had happened here. And she didn't answer for two hours.\" There is deep sadness here - and anger directed at the government and migrants. \"It can't go on like this,\" said Eidwicht. A Saudi refugee aged 50 has been arrested for the attack but the motive is unknown. Officials say Taleb Al-Abdulmohsen, was an \"untypical\" attacker. Germany's Christmas markets and festivals have come under attack before, mainly from extreme Islamists. He has been described as critical of Islam and he also voiced support on social media for the far-right Alternative for Germany party, hailing the party for fighting the same enemy as him \"to protect Germany\".\n\nThe AfD has not commented on those posts. The party held a rally in Magdeburg later on Monday where co-leader Alice Weidel called for change \"so we can finally live once again in security\". The crowd responded with calls of \"deport them\" according to news agencies. Her party is currently riding high in the opinion polls ahead of federal elections on 23 February, especially in states like Saxony-Anhalt in the former East Germany. This attack has brought two big elections issues to the fore, security and immigration, and AfD figures have highlighted both since the attack. Despite the suspect's many statements expressing hostility to Islam, the head of the AfD in Sachsen-Anhalt, Martin Reichardt, said in a statement \"the attack in Magdeburg shows that Germany is being drawn into political and religious fanaticism that has its origins in another world\". In a post on X, Weidel said the government's discussion of new security laws following the attack \"must not distract from the fact that Magdeburg would not have been possible without uncontrolled immigration. The state must protect its citizens through a restrictive migration policy and consistent deportations!\"\n\nReuters AfD leader Alice Weidel said the attack would not have been possible without \"uncontrolled migration\"\n\nA counter-demonstration also took place, with anti-racism groups accusing the AfD of exploiting the attack. David Begrich from Miteinander e.V. said people in the city needed a chance to catch their breath. \"In the migrant communities, there is great concern about being made into a scapegoat,\" he said. \"We don't want that. We want to organise solidarity across society, but at the same time we are also sensitive to the voices of those who are now reacting with fear and uncertainty.\" German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made a plea for national unity, saying \"a dark shadow hangs over this Christmas\". \"Hatred and violence must not have the final word. Let's not allow ourselves to be driven apart. Let's stand together!\" he said. Germans are asking how the attack could have happened, when security was already heightened at Christmas markets and when authorities had clearly investigated the suspect several times in recent years. The threat he posed was considered \"too unspecific\", according to one assessment, while one tip-off against him in September 2023 appears to have fallen through the cracks.",

    "body": "What we know about mysterious drones over New Jersey and other states\n\n19 December 2024 Share Save Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, Washington Share Save\n\nGetty Images Dozens of people have reported seeing drones over New Jersey since 18 November\n\nUS aviation authorities have announced a temporary ban on the use of drones in nearly two dozen cities of New Jersey until mid January. But mystery continues to swirl after nearly a month of drone sightings over New Jersey and other US states, alarming some residents. Authorities have been unable to provide definitive answers about these sightings, saying only that the flying objects are not believed to pose a danger to the public or national security. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas confirmed the sightings included drones, as well as manned aircraft commonly mistaken for drones. He added that he knows of \"no foreign involvement\" to do with the unmanned aerial vehicles. Some lawmakers have criticised the government's handling of the drone reports and the lack of public information. The drone reports have prompted a wide-range of baseless conspiracy theories, including that they are searching for nuclear weapons, radioactive \"dirty bombs\" or are form part of an impending invasion by aliens. Here's what we know.\n\nWhere have drones been spotted?\n\nDozens of drone sightings have been reported over New Jersey since 18 November, but others have been reported around the US north-east. Some of the flights were spotted near Picatinny Arsenal - a sensitive military research facility - as well as near President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in the town of Bedminster, New Jersey. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has since issued temporary restrictions prohibiting drone flights over 22 cities including Bedminster and Picatinny until 17 January. Sightings have also been reported in several other states: In New York City , several drones were reported flying over the Bronx on 12 December\n\n, several drones were reported flying over the Bronx on 12 December Stewart Airfield in New York state had to shut down for about an hour on 13 December because of drone activity, Governor Kathy Hochul said\n\nstate had to shut down for about an hour on 13 December because of drone activity, Governor Kathy Hochul said In Connecticut , police confirmed \"suspicious drone activity\". A drone detection system is now in use near the towns of Groton and New London\n\n, police confirmed \"suspicious drone activity\". A drone detection system is now in use near the towns of Groton and New London In Maryland , former Republican Governor Larry Hogan said he saw what appeared to be \"dozens\" of drones over his home in Davidsonville\n\n, former Republican Governor Larry Hogan said he saw what appeared to be \"dozens\" of drones over his home in Davidsonville In Massachusetts , two men were arrested on 14 December after a \"hazardous drone operation\" near Logan International Airport's airspace in Boston, police said\n\n, two men were arrested on 14 December after a \"hazardous drone operation\" near Logan International Airport's airspace in Boston, police said Multiple sightings have been reported in eastern Pennsylvania, including over Philadelphia\n\nincluding over Philadelphia In October, the Wall Street Journal reported that mysterious drones were seen for 17 days near US military facilities in Virginia\n\nIn Ohio, a US Air Force base was briefly closed on 13 December after small drones were detected flying nearby. More drones were reported on 16 and 17 December, although the airbase's operations were not impacted In late November, drones were also spotted over three US airbases in the UK, with British defence sources telling the BBC suspicion had fallen on a \"state actor\". Drones were also reported near the Ramstein US military airbase in Germany in early December. Are mystery drones above US bases in England something sinister?\n\nWhat have investigators said about the drones?\n\nUS President Joe Biden has said that there is \"nothing nefarious\" about the drone sightings, and \"no sense of danger\". In an earlier call with reporters, officials from several US agencies said there was no evidence of any threat to public safety. \"I think there has been a slight overreaction,\" an official from the FBI said. The homeland security secretary told ABC News on Sunday he knows of \"no foreign involvement with respect to the sightings in the north-east\". \"And we are vigilant in investigating this matter,\" he said. Mayorkas added: \"If there is any reason for concern, if we identify any foreign involvement or criminal activity, we will communicate with the American public accordingly.\" Following a closed-door briefing on 17 December, Connecticut representative Jim Himes said that senior defence and law enforcement officials had told lawmakers that \"there is zero evidence of laws being broken\" by the drones. He added that the \"vast majority\" of sightings were normal aircraft or drones being operated lawfully. Himes said that \"millions\" of unregistered drones were operating across the US, in addition to 800,000 registered drones that weigh more than half a pound.\n\nWhat are these flying objects?\n\nFollowing a briefing with the Department of Homeland Security on 11 December, New Jersey assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia said the drones appeared to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio. Fantasia said the aircraft were up to 6ft (1.8m) in diameter, travelling with lights turned off and \"operate in a co-ordinated manner\". Secretary Mayorkas told ABC that an explanation for the uptick in drone sightings could be to do with a change in federal law last year that allowed drones to be flown at night. \"That may be one of the reasons why now people are seeing more drones than they did before, especially from dawn to dusk,\" he said. A joint statement released by the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, FAA and defence department on 16 December said the sightings are a \"combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones.\" \"We have not identified anything anomalous,\" the statement said, adding that the government still recognises \"the concern among many communities.\" President-elect Donald Trump, for his part, claimed that the \"government knows what is happening\". \"For some reason, they don't want to comment,\" he added. \"I think they'd be better off saying what it is our military knows and our president knows.\" While he declined to answer whether he had been briefed on the sightings, Trump said that he \"can't imagine it's the enemy.\"\n\nWhere are they coming from?\n\nIt is unclear who might be operating them. New Jersey Republican representative Jeff Van Drew said that the drones were coming from an Iranian \"mothership\" in the Atlantic, while Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi said there was a \"non-trivial\" chance that China could be involved. The Pentagon, White House and homeland security department have all insisted that there is no foreign origin for the objects. A northern California man was charged on with flying a drone over and taking pictures of Vandenberg Space Force Base, located near Santa Barbara, on 30 November. The man, 39-year-old Chinese national Yinpiao Zhou was arrested just before he boarded a flight to China. But there has been no suggestion this incident has any connection with the spate of drone reports on the other side of the country.\n\nGetty Images The Pentagon says there is no foreign origin for the objects\n\nCan the drones be stopped?",

hazardous drone operation near logan international airports airspace in boston police said multiple sightings have been reported in eastern pennsylvania including over philadelphia including over philadelphia in october the wall street journal reported that mysterious drones were seen for 17 days near us military facilities in virginia in ohio a us air force base was briefly closed on 13 december after small drones were detected flying nearby more drones were reported on 16 and 17 december although the airbases operations were not impacted in late november drones were also spotted over three us airbases in the uk with british defence sources telling the bbc suspicion had fallen on a state actor drones were also reported near the ramstein us military airbase in germany in early december are mystery drones above us bases in england something sinister what have investigators said about the drones us president joe biden has said that there is nothing nefarious about the drone sightings and no sense of danger in an earlier call with reporters officials from several us agencies said there was no evidence of any threat to public safety i think there has been a slight overreaction an official from the fbi said the homeland security secretary told abc news on sunday he knows of no foreign involvement with respect to the sightings in the northeast and we are vigilant in investigating this matter he said mayorkas added if there is any reason for concern if we identify any foreign involvement or criminal activity we will communicate with the american public accordingly following a closeddoor briefing on 17 december connecticut representative jim himes said that senior defence and law enforcement officials had told lawmakers that there is zero evidence of laws being broken by the drones he added that the vast majority of sightings were normal aircraft or drones being operated lawfully himes said that millions of unregistered drones were operating across the us in addition to 800000 registered drones that weigh more than half a pound what are these flying objects following a briefing with the department of homeland security on 11 december new jersey assemblywoman dawn fantasia said the drones appeared to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio fantasia said the aircraft were up to 6ft 18m in diameter travelling with lights turned off and operate in a coordinated manner secretary mayorkas told abc that an explanation for the uptick in drone sightings could be to do with a change in federal law last year that allowed drones to be flown at night that may be one of the reasons why now people are seeing more drones than they did before especially from dawn to dusk he said a joint statement released by the department of homeland security fbi faa and defence department on 16 december said the sightings are a combination of lawful commercial drones hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones as well as manned fixedwing aircraft helicopters and stars mistakenly reported as drones we have not identified anything anomalous the statement said adding that the government still recognises the concern among many communities presidentelect donald trump for his part claimed that the government knows what is happening for some reason they dont want to comment he added i think theyd be better off saying what it is our military knows and our president knows while he declined to answer whether he had been briefed on the sightings trump said that he cant imagine its the enemy where are they coming from it is unclear who might be operating them new jersey republican representative jeff van drew said that the drones were coming from an iranian mothership in the atlantic while illinois democrat raja krishnamoorthi said there was a nontrivial chance that china could be involved the pentagon white house and homeland security department have all insisted that there is no foreign origin for the objects a northern california man was charged on with flying a drone over and taking pictures of vandenberg space force base located near santa barbara on 30 november the man 39yearold chinese national yinpiao zhou was arrested just before he boarded a flight to china but there has been no suggestion this incident has any connection with the spate of drone reports on the other side of the country getty images the pentagon says there is no foreign origin for the objects can the drones be stopped",
    "summary": "But mystery continues to swirl after nearly a month of drone sightings over New Jersey and other US states, alarming some residents.\nOn Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas confirmed the sightings included drones, as well as manned aircraft commonly mistaken for drones.\nDozens of drone sightings have been reported over New Jersey since 18 November, but others have been reported around the US north-east.\nUS President Joe Biden has said that there is \"nothing nefarious\" about the drone sightings, and \"no sense of danger\".\nThe Pentagon, White House and homeland security department have all insisted that there is no foreign origin for the objects.",

There was, the Saudis say, no response.\n\nInside the imposing sand coloured and fortress-like walls of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Riyadh there is a perhaps justifiable sense of pique.\n\nThe Saudi authorities, I am told, are currently working flat out to collate everything they have on the Magdeburg market suspect, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, and to share it with Germany's ongoing investigation \"in every way possible\".\n\nPart of the explanation for this may lie in the fact that Taleb al-Abdulmohsen was granted asylum by Germany in 2016, one year after the former Chancellor Angela Merkel threw open her country's borders to let in more than a million migrants from the Middle East, and 10 years after al-Abdulmohsen had taken up residence in Germany.\n\nComing from a country where Islam is the only religion permitted to be practised in public, al-Abdulmohsen was a very unusual citizen.\n\nHe had turned his back on Islam, making himself a heretic in the eyes of many.\n\nBorn in the Saudi date palm oasis town of Hofuf in 1974, little is known about his early life before he decided to leave Saudi Arabia and move to Europe aged 32.\n\nActive on social media, on his Twitter (later X) account he labels himself as both a psychiatrist and founder of a Saudi rights movement, together with the tag @SaudiExMuslims.\n\nHe founded a website aimed at helping Saudi women flee their country to Europe.\n\nThe Saudis say he was a people trafficker and the Ministry of Interior's investigators, the Mabaatheth, are said to have an extensive file on him.\n\nThere have been reports in recent years of dissident Saudis coming under hostile surveillance from Saudi government agents, in Canada, the US and in Germany.\n\nThere is no question that the German authorities, both federal and state, have made some serious errors of omission in the case of al-Abdulmohsen.\n\nWhatever their reasons for not responding, as the Saudis claim, to the repeated warnings about his extremism, he was seemingly a danger to his adopted host country.\n\nThere is also, separately, the failure to close off, or at least guard, the emergency access route to Magdeburg Alter Markt that allowed him to allegedly drive his BMW into the crowds.\n\nGerman authorities have defended the market's layout and said an investigation into the suspect's past is ongoing.\n\nBut a complicating factor here is that Saudi Arabia, although considered a friend and ally of the West, has a poor human rights record.\n\nUntil June 2018 Saudi women were forbidden to drive and even those women who publicly called for that ban to be lifted before then have been persecuted and imprisoned.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, still only in his 30s, just, is immensely popular in his own country.",

Among them is Tony Chung, the former leader of a pro-independence group who fled to the UK last year. The group - which includes a former district councillor, an actor, and a YouTuber - have been lobbying for more democracy in the territory. All have been accused of violating the city's national security law. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticised the move, calling on Hong Kong authorities to \"end their targeting of individuals in the UK and elsewhere who stand up for freedom and democracy\".\n\n\"We will not tolerate any attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas, especially in the UK,\" he said, adding that the UK government was committed to supporting those from Hong Kong who have relocated to the UK. Also on the wanted list is former district councillor Carmen Lau and activist Chloe Cheung. Both are based in the UK and lobby on behalf of two NGOs calling for more democracy in Hong Kong. Arrest warrants were also issued for political commentator and pollster Chung Kim-wah, who left Hong Kong for the UK in 2022, as well as two people based in Canada: former actor Joseph Tay, who co-founded the NGO HongKonger Station, and Youtuber Victor Ho. Mr Ho has been charged with subversion while the other six have been accused inciting secession and collusion with a foreign country or external forces. According to Hong Kong's public broadcaster RTHK, the arrest warrants were announced by the city's top police chiefs on Tuesday, who accused some of the wanted activists of repeatedly requesting foreign countries to impose sanctions and other measures against China and Hong Kong. Mr Chung was first convicted in 2021 for calling for Hong Kong's secession and was released in June last year. He posted on Instagram on Tuesday that it was \"an honour to become the first Hongkonger to be charged twice under the National Security Law\". Mr Chung said the news came as no surprise to him as he breached a supervision order after his release from prison by fleeing to the UK last year. \"I knew this day would come. From the moment I decided to leave Hong Kong, I was fully aware that I would not be able to return for a long time,\" he wrote. Mr Chung confirmed to the BBC that he was still waiting for his asylum application to be approved by the UK government.\n\nGetty Images Carmen Lau is also based in the UK and has been calling for more democracy in Hong Kong",

More than 200 nations met in South Korea for what was meant to be a final round of talks. But deep divisions remained between a group of nearly 100 \"high ambition\" countries calling for plastic to be phased out and oil-producing nations who warned this would affect the world's development. \"The objective of this treaty is to end plastic pollution not plastic itself, plastic has brought immense benefit to societies worldwide,\" said the Kuwait negotiators in the final hours.\n\nIn 2022, the world's nations agreed that a global treaty was needed to tackle the issue of plastic pollution particularly the impacts on the marine environment - and this should be completed within two years given the urgency of the issue. Since 1950, more than eight billion tonnes of plastic have been produced globally but less than 10% has been recycled, estimates the United Nations. This has led to millions of tonnes entering the world's oceans and seas, posing serious risks to wildlife and their environment. Birds, fish and whales can become injured or killed if they become entangled in plastic debris or mistakenly ingest it, leading to starvation. Plastic is also produced from fossil fuels, and is currently estimated to be responsible for 5% of global emissions - so efforts to restrict it could also help with efforts to tackle climate change. The meeting in Busan, South Korea, was meant to be the final fifth round of negotiations but after late night talks countries were unable to resolve their differences missing their key two-year deadline. \"A few critical issues prevent us from reaching a comprehensive agreement,\" said the talks' chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso on Sunday - the final day of talks. Although many issues are being discussed the key split is around Article 6 - whether there should be a commitment to cutting how much plastic is produced, or just try and reduce plastic waste by increasing efforts to recycle.\n\nA group of 95 countries have emerged, including the UK, European Union, African Group and many South American nations, who are calling for Article 6 to be a legally binding pledge to reduce production levels. \"We carry the weight of expectations of our citizens who are counting on us to protect them and the environment to protect it from the plastic pollution crisis,\" said Camila Zepeda, Mexico's chief negotiator, who spoke on behalf of this group at the final meeting. \"We must do everything in our power to meet this expectation.\" Her speech was meet with strong applause across the room, but a group of oil-producing nations including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and Russia pushed back strongly. The demand for oil across most sectors is expected to fall from 2026 as countries move to cleaner technologies like electric vehicles - but plastic is seen as one of the remaining growth markets. This may explain why these countries are particularly concerned about any global target to cut production levels. \"Attempting to phase out plastic rather than addressing the issue of plastic production risks undermining global progress and exacerbating economic inequality,\" said Salman Alajmi, a Kuwait delegate.\n\nGetty Images The amount of plastic entering the world's rivers and seas is expected to triple by 2040 at current rates of production\n\nIndia also voiced its concerns with including any commitments to cut production of plastic on the basis it could impact its right to development. Environmental charities and scientists expressed their deep disappointment that the talks had collapsed and raised concerns about the influence of the fossil fuel industry. InfluenceMap, a think tank, found that the petrochemical industry intervened dozens of times on the treaty via company statements, social media and consultation responses, and 93% of those were unsupportive of efforts to cut production levels. But the report did highlight that these efforts were outweighed by positive support from key manufacturers of plastic products like Unilever, Mars and Nestl\u00e9 who want consistent global regulation on the issue. Jodie Roussell, global public affairs lead for sustainability at Nestl\u00e9, said of the talks' collapse: \"Disappointingly, consensus among all nations remains elusive, which further delays critical action to end plastic pollution. \"It also fails to deliver the certainty that business needs to mobilise investment and scale solutions.\" It is now expected that countries will reconvene next year to try and get an agreement, but Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics policy manager at conservation charity the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), told the BBC that the group of 95 should go ahead with their own treaty. \"I think the political reality is that most countries in the world want this \u2013 that is the positive thing we can take from this. \"Those countries shouldn\u2019t accept anything less than what they are asking for, there are already so many that a treaty would have a massive impact on ending plastic pollution and that option should be on the table.\"",

    "body": "MP calls for first-cousin marriage to be banned\n\n10 December 2024 Share Save Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nA Conservative former minister has called for first-cousin marriage to be banned in the UK. Introducing the proposals in Parliament, Richard Holden said the children of first cousins were at greater risk of birth defects and the practice should be prohibited to protect public health. However, independent MP Iqbal Mohamed argued a ban would be ineffective and said these issues would be better addressed through education programmes to raise awareness of the risks. Downing Street said the expert advice on the risks of first-cousin marriage was clear but indicated that the government had no plans to change the law.\n\n\"In terms of legislation, the government has set out its priorities,\" a No 10 spokesman said. Holden introduced his proposals using the 10-minute rule process, which allows a backbench MP to make the case for a new bill in a speech of up to 10 minutes in the Commons. However, such bills are unlikely to become law without government support because of the limited parliamentary time available for them. Under current legislation, marriages to a sibling, parent or child are prohibited but not between first cousins.\n\nHolden said that while the overall prevalence of first-cousin marriage was low in Western countries, certain diaspora communities, such as Irish travellers and British Pakistanis, had \"extremely high rates\" of 20-40%. The MP for Basildon and Billericay cited research suggesting the child of first cousins carries around double the risk of inheriting a serious disorder compared to the child or unrelated people. Holden also argued the practice threatened women's freedom. \"Women and girls living under a clan mentality often know the scientific risks of first-cousin marriage, but make considered social and cultural calculations,\" he told MPs. \"Strict honour codes, where expressions of individuality can be subject to social isolation, violence and even death in some cases, dominate thinking.\" He said first-cousin marriage was \"not really conducive to modern British society\", adding: \"It's about more than one marriage. It's about the values and foundations of our society and our democracy.\"",

    "title": "Archbishop of Canterbury: Why did Justin Welby resign after abuse scandal?",
    "body": "The abuse scandal that led to the archbishop's resignation\n\n12 November 2024 Share Save Amy Walker BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nJustin Welby has resigned as Archbishop of Canterbury after facing increasing pressure to stand down over his failure to report prolific child abuser John Smyth. Here are the events that led up to Mr Welby's resignation after 11 years in the post.\n\nWhy has Welby resigned?\n\nA damning independent review published last week found Mr Welby - the most senior bishop within the Church of England - and other church officers should have formally reported Smyth in 2013 to police in the UK and authorities in South Africa. Smyth was accused of attacking dozens of boys, including those he met at Christian camps, in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s. The barrister and senior member of a Christian charity then moved to Zimbabwe and later South Africa, where he abused up to 100 boys aged 13 to 17, the Makin review added. By 2013, the Church of England \"knew, at the highest level\" about Smyth's abuse, including Mr Welby who took up the Church's top job that year. If he and other Church officers had reported this to police in the UK and authorities in South Africa at that time, \u201cJohn Smyth could have [been] brought to justice at a much earlier point\u201d, the independent report said. Mr Welby had previously resisted calls to step aside over his response to the case since 2013. But amid mounting pressure, he said in a statement on Tuesday he must take \"personal and institutional responsibility\". The prime minister's spokeswoman said Keir Starmer \"respects the decision\" to step down and his thoughts \"first and foremost, remain with all the victims\u201d.\n\nWhen did the abuse allegations first surface?\n\nSmyth was under police investigation when he died\n\nSmyth's abuse was first reported to the charity Iwerne Trust, where he had been chairman, in the early 1980s. A report detailing his \"horrific\" beatings of teenaged boys was presented to some Church leaders in 1982. But the recipients of that report \"participated in an active cover-up\" to prevent its findings, including that crimes had been committed, coming to light, the Makin review said. Smyth's abuse in the UK re-emerged in 2012, when a church officer in Cambridgeshire received a letter \u201cout of the blue\u201d from a fellow survivor. The review stated that five police forces were told of the abuse between 2013 and 2016. Church leaders however did not lodge a formal report. It was not until 2017, after a Channel 4 documentary revealed details about Smyth's abuse to the public, that police launched a full investigation. Smyth is believed to have continued his abuse in South Africa until his death in 2018.\n\nHow much did Welby know about Smyth?\n\nMr Welby worked at summer camps in Dorset where Smyth met some of his victims, but the archbishop said he was unaware of the nature of the allegations until 2013. A member of the clergy warned Mr Welby about Smyth in the 1980s, but the archbishop told the review this had been \"vague\" and \"there was no indication given of the abuses which later came to light\". After the Channel 4 documentary was broadcast in 2017, Mr Welby apologised \"unreservedly\" to Smyth's victims but did not resign. Following the Makin review this month, the archbishop said he had considered resigning over its findings and repeated his apology. Mr Welby acknowledged that the review made clear he had \"personally failed to ensure it was energetically investigated\". But on Tuesday, following a petition set up by members of the Church's parliament - the General Synod - and mounting pressure to go, Mr Welby resigned.\n\nWhat did his critics say?\n\nDIOCESE OF NEWCASTLE Bishop Hartley said it was \"hard to find the words\" to respond to last week's report\n\nCritics included Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley, who said Mr Welby's resignation would \"be a very clear indication that a line has been drawn, and that we must move towards independence of safeguarding\". Andrew Morse, a survivor of Smyth's abuse, also called for Mr Welby to go, saying that he felt the archbishop's admission that he had not done enough in response to the reports meant that both he and the Church of England had effectively been involved in a \"cover-up\". The petition calling for his resignation, which accused the archbishop of \"allowing abuse to continue\" and said his position was \"no longer tenable\", was signed by more than 14,000 people. The prime minister had also publicly said victims of Smyth had been \"failed very, very badly,\" but would not comment when asked whether the archbishop should quit.\n\nHow will the new Archbishop of Canterbury be chosen?",

    "title": "UK wants 'strong' relationship with China, says Keir Starmer",
    "body": "We want 'strong' UK-China relationship, says Starmer\n\n18 November 2024 Share Save Sam Francis & Jennifer McKiernan Political reporter Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nSir Keir Starmer has met President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit, and emphasised the importance of a \"strong UK-China relationship\" for both countries. The meeting was the first time a UK prime minister has met the Chinese president in person since 2018, following a recent souring in relations. Sir Keir raised the case of the jailed Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, Jimmy Lai, saying he was concerned about reports of a \"deterioration\" in his health. The PM also signalled a desire for greater business co-operation, particularly on \"areas of mutual cooperation\" such as international stability, climate change and economic growth.\n\nSir Keir met President Xi on the fringes of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and, speaking at the start of the meeting, said: \"We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful, as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible.\" He added: \"The UK will be a predictable, consistent, sovereign actor committed to the rule of law.\" Speaking through a translator, Xi told Sir Keir that the two countries should commit to mutual respect and openness, saying: \"China and the UK have broad space for co-operation across various domains, including trade, investment, clean energy, financial services, healthcare and improving our peoples' well-being.\" A read-out of the closed door meeting said the PM set out the leaders' shared responsibility to work together in pursuit of global stability, economic co-operation and trade, and efforts to move away from fossil fuels to renewables. Climate change was a focus for the PM, and a Downing Street spokesperson said the PM wants China's support on global efforts, particularly in light of President-elect Trump's expected roll back of green policies. However, Sir Keir also stressed his government's approach would \"always be rooted in the national interests of the UK, but that we would be a predictable and pragmatic partner\" to China. With China's military support for Russia's war in Ukraine having prompted criticism from the UK and other Western countries, the PM also said he wanted to \"engage honestly and frankly\" on areas of disagreement, including on Hong Kong, human rights and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Their first meeting follows an initial phone conversation in August after Labour's election victory and Sir Keir has now proposed a full bilateral meeting in Beijing or London. The pair also agreed Chancellor Rachel Reeves should visit Beijing next year to discuss economic and financial cooperation with her counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng. The Conservative's shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said: \u201cBritain's standing on the world stage risks being weakened if the prime minister does not robustly defend our national interest.\" She said constructive dialogue was important but that Sir Keir \"should have been stronger in raising our concerns over human rights, the repressive nature of the national security laws imposed on Hong Kong, and the security, safety and wellbeing of British nationals, like Jimmy Lai, who should be freed from custody\". \"Starmer must set out, as part of his supposed reset, what assurances he received from President Xi on the UK\u2019s areas of concern.\u201d\n\nBefore the meeting in Brazil, the prime minister said it was important to engage with economies like China - and Foreign Secretary David Lammy held talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, as well as Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, in Beijing last month. The last British prime minister to meet President Xi was Theresa May, who hailed a \"golden era\" for UK-China relations during her 2018 visit to the country. But since then there have been tensions over issues including China's treatment of the Uyghur minority group in Xinjiang and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. Last year, then-Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said China was \"the biggest state-based threat to our economic security\". But like the current government, he also said it was necessary to engage with China on issues like climate change and the global economy. Dr Yu Jie, a China expert from the Chatham House international think tank, said the G20 meeting was \"critical\" for UK-China relations to thaw after a six-year freeze - and suggested there could be a trade deal in sight, despite significant diplomatic tensions. \"Judging from the readout given by both sides, the tone of the conversation seemed to be positive,\" said Dr Yu. \"But when they came to specifics it seems on the thorny issues they have not really reached any agreement at all.\" Dr Yu warned both sides' efforts could still be overshadowed by pressure from the US. \"That's something quite difficult for the British government, if the US is going to be adding extra pressure for the UK to be in line with the US on China policy,\" she said, describing how she expected the US policy towards China to be \"hawkish\" under Trump.\n\nReuters Jimmy Lai - a pro-democracy activist and British citizen - was arrested in 2020 and his release from a Hong Kong prison is a \"priority\", the UK government says\n\nSpeaking to reporters on his way to the summit in Rio de Janeiro, Sir Keir also said \"shoring up support for Ukraine\" was top of his agenda. Before the meeting, Downing Street said the prime minister will urge other G20 nations to step up their support for Ukraine or face \"unfathomable consequences\" if Russia is allowed to be victorious. The summit follows large-scale missile and drone attacks by Russia across Ukraine over the weekend, and will take place as the conflict approaches its 1,000th day. And it comes amid reports that the US has authorised the use of long-range missiles it supplies to Ukraine to strike Russia. The weapons have so far only been used by Kyiv on Russian-occupied targets within its own territory. The UK has also supplied Ukraine with its Storm Shadow missiles and defence officials and ministers have been making the case for Kyiv to be permitted to use them to hit targets inside Russia. But they were not willing to act alone - and had been waiting for the White House to change its mind. Sir Keir said he was \"not going to get into operational details\" with regards to missiles in Ukraine.\n\nSir Keir is holding talks with other G20 leaders, representing 19 of the world\u2019s largest economies and the African Union and the European Union. The summit is overshadowed by the absence of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has called for allies to take a more aggressive approach towards China and may trigger a global trade war if he imposes a promised 60% tariff on Chinese goods entering the US. This summit will provide world leaders a first chance to compare notes and prepare for Trump's upcoming return to the White House.",

I was happy to hear that there\u2019s been some movement over in Laos - we cannot have our girls passing and this continuing to happen,\" Ms Jones's father Mark told reporters.\n\nThe bodies of the Australians were flown home to Melbourne late on Tuesday, accompanied by their relatives.\n\nBianca Jones and Holly Bowles, both 19, were among six foreign tourists who died after apparently consuming the toxic substance, which is commonly added to bootleg alcohol.\n\nThe families of two Australian teenagers killed in a suspected methanol poisoning in Laos have welcomed news that eight people have been detained during a police investigation into the incident.\n\nThe eight people detained for questioning on Tuesday were staff at the Nana Backpackers hostel where all the victims had been staying, according to local media.\n\nThe owners of the hostel, which is now closed, have previously denied serving illicit alcohol.\n\nSpeaking at Melbourne Airport, Mr Jones urged the government in Laos to \"continue to pursue\" the case, adding that the families involved would try to \"raise awareness of methanol poisoning\".\n\nThe other four victims have been named as Simone White, a 28-year-old lawyer from the UK; James Louis Hutson, a 57-year-old American; and Danish citizens Anne-Sofie Orkild Coyman, 20, and Freja Vennervald Sorensen, 21.\n\nMr Hutson was found dead in his bedroom at the hostel on 13 November with several empty glasses nearby.

    "body": "China is trying to fix its economy - Trump could derail those plans\n\n8 November 2024 Share Save Jo\u00e3o da Silva Business reporter Share Save\n\nReuters Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at their last face-to-face meeting in 2019\n\nChina has unveiled new measures aimed at boosting its flagging economy, as it braces for a second Donald Trump presidency. The country plans to tackle tens of billions of dollars of local government debt to prevent it being a drag on growth. Trump won the US election on a platform that promised steep import taxes, including tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods. His victory is now likely to hinder Xi Jinping\u2019s plans to transform the country into a technology powerhouse \u2013 and further strain relations between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. A property slump, rising government debt and unemployment, and low consumption have slowed down Chinese growth since the pandemic.\n\nSo the stakes are higher than ever for the latest announcement from the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), the executive body of China's legislature. During his first term in office Trump hit Chinese goods with tariffs of as much as 25%. China analyst Bill Bishop says Trump should be taken at his word about his new tariff plans. \"I think we should believe that he means it when [he] talks about tariffs, that he sees China as having reneged on his trade deal, that he thinks China and Covid cost him the 2020 election\". The pressure from Washington did not ease after Trump left the White House in 2021. The Biden administration kept the measures in place and in some cases widened them. While the first wave of Trump tariffs were painful for China, the country is now in a much more vulnerable position. The economy has been struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels of growth since abruptly abandoning its tight Covid restrictions two years ago. Instead of delivering a widely expected fast-paced recovery, China became a regular source of disappointing economic news. Even before Trump's election victory and after China began rolling out measures to support its economy in September, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered its annual growth target for the country. The IMF now expects the Chinese economy to expand by 4.8% in 2024, at the lower end of Beijing's \"about 5%\" target. Next year, it projects China's annual growth rate will drop further to 4.5%. The latest plan involves using an additional 6 trillion yuan ($840bn) from now until 2026 to bail out local governments which have piled up unsustainable levels of debt. For decades, local governments have helped drive growth throughout the country by borrowing massive sums of money - much of which paid for infrastructure projects. But a downturn in the property industry has left some cities unable to pay their bills.\n\nBut the country's leaders were not caught entirely off guard by the end to decades of super-fast growth. Speaking in 2017, President Xi said his country planned to transition from \"rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development.\" The term has since been used repeatedly by Chinese officials to describe a shift to an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and green industries. But some economists say China cannot simply export itself out of trouble. China risks falling into the type of decades-long stagnation that Japan endured after a stock and property bubble burst in the 1990s, Morgan Stanley Asia's former chairman, Stephen Roach, says. To avoid that fate, he says China should draw \"on untapped consumer demand\" and move away from \"export and investment-led growth\". That would not only encourage more sustainable growth but also lower \"trade tensions and [China's] vulnerability to external shocks,\" he says. This more robust economic model could help China fend off the kind of threats posed by Trump's return to power.\n\nNew economy, old problems",

The rap megastar is famously a fan of Toronto Raptors - the NBA's only Canadian team - and is regularly seen courtside watching games. He's also said to have made friends with current and former players, including DeMar DeRozan, who returned to the Raptors' Scotiabank Arena as a member of opponents Sacramento Kings on Saturday. But the Hotline Bling star didn't exactly welcome his old friend back with open arms.\n\nGetty Images Drake caught up with ex-Raptors player Vince Carter before his number 15 jersey was retired\n\nDuring the weekend's match-up the Raptors retired the jersey of legend Vince Carter. It's a common tribute NBA teams perform to honour significant former players, hanging their numbers from banners high up inside stadiums. DeRozan is a six-time NBA All-Star who played for the Raptors from 2009 to 2018, making him a good candidate for the same treatment. But speaking on Canadian Sports network TSN, Drake said: \"If you ever put a DeRozan banner up, I'll go up there and pull it down myself.\" Speaking to reporters after the game, he clapped back at the rapper when asked about his comments. \"He's going to have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck,\" he said.\n\nDeRozan appeared in the video for Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us - the fiery diss track aimed at Drake that blew up the internet when it dropped earlier this year. The basketball star also appeared on stage with Lamar when he performed the track in Los Angeles over the summer. DeRozan told reporters at the time that he still considered Drake a friend, and compared the feud to a spectacle along the lines of Michael Jordan facing Kobe Bryant one-on-one. Based on Drake's brief comment, the rapper might not feel quite the same. But he can at least take comfort in the fact that the Raptors beat the Kings by 131-128.",

    "body": "Xi says he will work with Trump in last meeting with Biden\n\n17 November 2024 Share Save Frances Mao BBC News Share Save\n\nReuters The leaders met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru on Saturday\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping has pledged to work with incoming President Donald Trump in his final meeting with current US leader Joe Biden. But president Xi also took the opportunity to state China\u2019s objectives in what appears to be a message to Donald Trump and the next administration in Washington. In a robust readout of the meeting released afterwards, Beijing said President Xi had underscored that \"a new Cold War should not be fought and cannot be won. Containing China is unwise, unacceptable and bound to fail\". Xi also said a stable relationship between China and the United States was \"critical to both parties and the world\".\n\nThe two met on Saturday on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Peru where they acknowledged \"ups and downs\" in relations over Biden's four years in office. Speaking at Saturday's meeting, which was held at President Xi's hotel in Lima, the leader said that if the US and China \"treat each other as opponents or enemies, engage in vicious competition and mutual harm, China-US relations will suffer setbacks or even regressions\". He added that Beijing's goal of a stable relationship with Washington would remain unchanged and that he would work with the new US administration \"to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences.\" Biden, meanwhile, said strategic competition between the two global powers should not escalate into war. \"Our two countries cannot let any of this competition veer into conflict. That is our responsibility and over the last four years I think we've proven it's possible to have this relationship,\" he said. Both leaders highlighted progress in lowering tensions on issues such as trade and Taiwan. Analysts say US-China relations could become more volatile when Trump returns to office in two months, driven by factors including a promise to raise tariffs on Chinese imports. The president-elect has pledged 60% tariffs on all imports from China. He has also appointed prominent China hawks to top foreign and defence positions. During his first term, Trump labelled Beijing a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d. Relations worsened when he labelled Covid a \u201cChinese virus\u201d during the pandemic.",

The force said it had made a mandatory referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct because there was previous contact with Ms Brella. Northamptonshire Telegraph first reported she was the subject of a domestic violence protection order, saying it was made in early September and lasted 28 days.

The force said there would be extra neighbourhood officer patrols in Corby in the coming days to reassure the public.\n\nOn Sunday, police were in the area where Ms Brella lived",

    "body": "Israel hit part of Iran's nuclear programme, Netanyahu says\n\nAxios reported last week that a \u201cnuclear weapons research facility\u201c at Parchin was hit in late October\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Iran, but it has previously said the Israeli strikes caused limited damage to radar systems and that its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful.\n\nHe gave no details, but last week Axios reported that a \u201cnuclear weapons research facility\u201d making plastic explosives at the Parchin military complex was destroyed .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a secret. It was published,\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu told the Israeli parliament. \u201cThere is a specific component in their nuclear programme that was hit.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s prime minister says it hit part of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme last month, despite pleas from the US not to do so during the strikes it carried out in response to a missile attack.\n\nIran has also insisted that it does not seek nuclear weapons, although evidence collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) suggests that until 2003 it conducted activities relevant to the development of a bomb. The agency says Iran has not yet answered outstanding questions related to its nuclear activity.\n\nThe IAEA also says Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium to build several nuclear weapons since the US abandoned a nuclear deal and reinstated crippling sanctions six years ago with Netanyahu\u2019s support.\n\nOn 26 October, the Israeli military announced it had conducted \u201cprecise strikes on military targets in Iran\u201d in response to the 1 October attack that saw almost 200 ballistic missiles launched towards Israel.\n\nThe military said the targets included missile manufacturing facilities, as well as surface-to-air missile arrays and aerial capabilities intended to restrict Israel\u2019s freedom of operation inside Iran.\n\nIran\u2019s military said the attacks caused \u201climited and minor damage\u201d to several radar systems and that four Iranian military officers and one civilian were killed.

    "body": "Russia vows 'tangible' response if US missiles used against its territory\n\n19 November 2024 Share Save Paulin Kola BBC News Share Save\n\nREX/Shutterstock The Russian foreign ministry issued a statement on Monday\n\nRussia says the use of US long-range missiles by Ukraine will lead to \"an appropriate and tangible\" response. Such an attack inside Russian territory \"would represent the direct involvement of the United States and its satellites in hostilities against Russia\", a foreign ministry statement said. President Joe Biden approved the use of the missiles on targets in Russia in a major change of US policy - two months before he is due to leave the White House. It is not clear if his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, was consulted or whether he will stick by the decision, having promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nUkraine has had US ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) with a range of 300km (190 miles) - as well as French and British Storm Shadow missiles of a similar range - but the Western allies had barred Kyiv from hitting Russia with them. Biden's decision to lift that condition is a significant moment in the war, which marks its 1,000th day on Tuesday. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Moscow has now intensified attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure as the sides appear to have reached a stalemate on the battlefield. Could missiles change the course of the war?\n\nRosenberg: Fury in Russia\n\nWhat we know about North Korean soldiers in Russia\n\nUkraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia The US decision also follows the arrival in Russia's western Kursk region - where Ukrainian forces captured and are holding onto a small piece of territory - of more than 10,000 troops from North Korea to help President Vladimir Putin's forces. Unconfirmed reports say North Korea may send as many as 100,000 soldiers, in addition to artillery and other weapons to its ally.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has indicated there may be no formal announcement of the US deal - \"the missiles will speak for themselves,\" he said on Sunday. Ukraine may use the ATACMS in Kursk first - in fact some reports suggest the US may have restricted their use there as a signal to North Korea to stop sending aid to Russia and to Moscow itself. Biden's approval of the long-range missiles - which may be followed by similar authorisations by the UK and France - is being seen in the West as a way of signalling to the Russian leader that he cannot win the Ukraine war militarily. Putin has not commented on the latest move. In September, the Russian leader said the use of such missiles by Ukraine would represent the \"direct participation\" of Nato countries in the war. On Monday, Putin's spokesman said the US was \"adding oil to the fire\". But Jon Finer, US deputy national security adviser, said Washington had made it \"clear to the Russians that we would respond\" - both to the presence of North Korean forces and the \"major escalation\" in Russian aerial attacks on infrastructure across Ukraine. The weekend saw intense Russian attacks against Ukraine's power grid, causing large-scale blackouts. Several people were killed or injured. On Monday, a Russian strike on Odesa killed another 10 people and injured nearly 50.",

    "body": "New film to mark Bradford fire tragedy anniversary\n\n25 November 2024 Share Save Hayley Coyle BBC News, Yorkshire Share Save\n\nBBC The wooden stand at Bradford City's Valley Parade ground became engulfed in just four minutes\n\nA new documentary marking the 40th anniversary of the Bradford City stadium fire, which claimed the lives of 56 people, will be released next year, the BBC has said. The blaze broke out in one of the wooden stands at the club's Valley Parade ground on 11 May 1985 during a match between Bradford and Lincoln. The new film, with a working title of Unforgotten: The Bradford City Fire, would feature the personal testimonies of those who were there, many of whom would be speaking for the first time, according to the BBC. Jaimie D\u2019Cruz, executive producer, said because the tragedy was in danger of fading from memory, it was a \"privilege and a responsibility\" to make the documentary.\n\nIt is believed the fire, which caused the deaths of 54 Bradford fans and two Lincoln fans, and which left more than 260 people injured, was caused by a discarded cigarette. The stand where the fire broke out had been officially condemned and was due to be demolished and replaced with a steel structure.\n\n'Collective memory'\n\nThe creators of the documentary said it would combine \"extraordinary access\" to the people who survived, as well as family members of the bereaved and members of the emergency crews who attended the scene. The aim of the film was to celebrate \"community, resilience and collective memory\" and the strength of the human spirit in the wake of such devastation, they said. Simon Young, BBC Head of Commissioning, History, said: \u201cThis film gets at the heart of a modern dilemma: in a world where everything is recorded on film, how do we sensitively remember and commemorate?\" \"What should remain off limits? And how do we ensure that a tragedy is marked and the lessons learned for future generations?\" he asked. Mr Young said it was an \"honour\" to be working on the project with the people of Bradford \"to ensure this anniversary is not forgotten\".\n\nFloral tributes were left after the disaster that left 56 dead on 11 May 1985",

We know that he's not in our lake,\u201d Matthew Vande Kolk, Chief Deputy Sheriff for Green Lake County, told the BBC.\n\nAuthorities in Green Lake, Wisconsin, say that a local man who went missing while kayaking this summer may have staged his own death and fled to Europe.\n\nMr Borgwardt had last texted his wife on the night of 11 August. The message said he was turning his kayak around and heading to shore soon.\n\nBut when he failed to return home, his family contacted law enforcement who sent out a search-and-rescue team, which found his capsized kayak and life jacket on the lake.\n\nMr Borgwardt\u2019s car, trailer, fishing rod and wallet were all left at the park nearby.\n\nAfter 54 days of extensive search efforts of divers, drones, sonar and cadaver dogs, no body was recovered and no evidence turned up.\n\nThat caused the sheriff's office to widen its scope.\n\nThe case took a turn in October when investigators discovered Mr Borgwardt's name had been checked by border officials in Canada on 13 August, the day after he was reported missing.\n\nInvestigators then learned that Mr Borgwardt had reported his passport lost or stolen and was issued a new one prior to his disappearance.\n\nHis previous passport was later recovered from his wife, indicating he may have travelled on the new document.\n\nFollowing this lead, officials conducted a digital forensic analysis of Mr Borgwardt\u2019s laptop, and they found that he had taken out a $375,000 life insurance policy, had transferred funds to a foreign bank account, photographed his new passport, and altered his email address before he vanished.\n\nAnd after doing this, they discovered that Mr Borgwardt had replaced the laptop\u2019s hard drive and cleared his browser history the day he disappeared.\n\nAuthorities also found indications that he may have traveled to a location in Europe.\n\nWhile the investigation continues, the sheriff\u2019s office told the BBC they are evaluating the appropriate criminal charges that could include obstruction and fraudulent activity.\n\nBorgwardt\u2019s family is cooperating and the chief deputy sheriff said his wife has been \u201cextremely strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has done everything that we have asked of her in regards to helping us with information, and holding on to information,\" Mr Vande Kolk told the BBC. \"Unfortunately, we had to keep this quiet for about a month from the time that we started thinking that he was somewhere else, until we had enough information that we could share with the world, and she did that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur hope is then, at some point we'll be able to hold Ryan accountable for his actions and request restitution,\u201d he added.\n\nAuthorities said that they are continuing to look for Mr. Borgwardt, who they believe is alive and in Eastern Europe, and anyone who may have assisted him in faking his death and fleeing.",

Deaths declined afterwards but rose again in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic amid increasing social isolation.\n\nExperts are unsure of what exactly is causing the current decline in overdose deaths but attribute some of it to a post-pandemic return to normalcy.\n\nMoney going into the hardest hit communities has increased the availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone and addiction treatments such as buprenorphine.\n\nBillions of dollars in legal settlements against opioid companies are also suspected to be playing a role in the decrease.\n\nIn the latest CDC data, overdose death reports are down in most US states, though some did see an increase.\n\nIn Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington the number of overdose death reports rose.",

Vaibhav Suryavanshi from the eastern state of Bihar was bought by Rajasthan Royals (RR) for 11m rupees ($130,500; \u00a3103,789) in the recently-concluded auctions in Saudi Arabia. The left-handed batter has represented his state in national championships, such as Ranji and Mushtaq Ali trophies, and India in the Under-19 internationals. Delhi Capitals and RR bid for him starting from 3m rupees but RR, where he had trained previously, managed to seal the deal.\n\nIndian cricket was traditionally dominated by urban centres such as Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru but IPL has managed to attract a wider pool of cricketers from far-off villages and small towns of India. Suryavanshi, who is in Dubai to play India Under-19 Asia Cup, made his Ranji debut at the age of 12 in January with Bihar against Mumbai. In his five Ranji matches, he has scored a highest of 41. But the highlight of his career has been his 58-ball century as an opener in an Under-19 unofficial Test against Australia a few weeks ago \u2013 which also made him the youngest to score a century in youth cricket. He has also made an unbeaten 332 in an Under-19 tournament in Bihar. RR saw raw potential in the youngster as he impressed their coaching staff during a training session. \"He's an incredible talent and, of course, you got to have the confidence so he can step up to the IPL level,\" the team's CEO Jake Lush McCrum told ESPN Cricinfo after the auction ended. He said that Suryavanshi\u2019s development would require work, but \"he is a hell of a talent and we're really excited to have him as part of the franchise\".\n\nVaibhav Suryavanshi/Instagram Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his Ranji debut with Bihar at the age of 12 earlier this year against heavyweight Mumbai",

    "body": "Kim Jong Un is China's ally - but has become the 'comrade from hell'\n\n1 November 2024 Share Save Laura Bicker BBC News Reporting from Fangchuan, China-Russia-North Korea border Share Save\n\nBBC A tall building on the edge of Fangchuan has become a tourist attraction for the view it offers of North Korea\n\nChinese tourists huddle together against the brisk autumn breeze on a 12-storey building, vying for the best spot to photograph the point where their country meets Russia and North Korea. The three national flags overlap on a map on the wall, which explains that Fangchuan in China\u2019s north-east corner is a unique place for that reason. \u201cI feel very proud to be standing here\u2026 with Russia on my left and North Korea on my right,\u201d declares one woman on a trip with her co-workers. \u201cThere are no borders among the people.\u201d That might be overly optimistic. Like the sliver of sandwiched Chinese territory she has travelled to see, Beijing too is caught between its sanctioned neighbours. Fears over the budding alliance between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un have peaked in recent weeks, with reports of North Korea deploying thousands of troops to support Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. And that was before Pyongyang fired a banned intercontinental missile on Thursday, on the longest flight recorded yet \u2013 after turning up the rhetoric against Seoul for weeks. \u201cChina seeks a relationship with a reasonable, high level of control over North Korea,\u201d says Christopher Green, an analyst from the International Crisis Group. \u201cAnd North Korea\u2019s relationship with Russia threatens to undermine that.\u201d If Chinese leader Xi Jinping is unable shape the Putin-Kim alliance to suit his interests, China may well remain stuck in the middle as western anger and anxiety grows.\n\nMoscow and Pyongyang deny that North Korean soldiers are headed for Ukraine, widely seen as a significant escalation. But the United States says it has seen evidence of this, following allegations by South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence. The first reports emerged just before Xi met his Russian counterpart at the Brics summit earlier in October, overshadowing a gathering that was meant to send the West a defiant message. It increasingly appears as though China\u2019s allies are spiralling out of its control. Beijing, the senior partner in the triad, seeks to be the stable leader of a new world order, one that is not led by the US. But that\u2019s difficult to do when one ally has started a war in Europe, and another is accused of aiding the invasion. \u201cChina is unhappy with the way things are going,\u201d Mr Green says, \u201cbut they are trying to keep their discontent relatively quiet.\u201d It\u2019s certainly a sensitive topic for Beijing, judging by the response to our presence in the border town, where it seems tourists are welcome - but journalists are not. We were in public areas at all times, and yet the team was stopped, repeatedly questioned, followed and our footage deleted. The hotel demanded to keep my passport for \u201cmy safety and the safety of others\u201d. Police visited our hotel rooms, and they also blocked the road to the port at Hunchun, which would have given us a closer view of the current trade between Russia and China.\n\n'Lips and teeth'\n\nOn the viewing platform in Fangchuan, it\u2019s clear that most tourists have come to see North Korea. \u201cI saw a person cycling,\u201d says one girl peering through a telescope. Her friend rushes over to see: \u201cOoooh! It\u2019s such a mysterious country.\u201d Close by is the Tumen river that gently cuts through all three countries. It is China\u2019s gateway into the Sea of Japan, where it has territorial disputes with Tokyo. The 1,400km-long (870 mile) Chinese border has some of the only platforms with a clear view into North Korea. South Korea\u2019s frontier with the North is an almost impenetrable barrier, the heavily mined and fortified Demilitarized Zone. Someone offers me a pair of binoculars. Some people are cycling through the village on ageing bicycles, but there are few other signs of life. One of the largest buildings is a school with a sign calling for children to \u201clearn well for Chosun\u201d, another name for North Korea. \u201cNorth Korea has always been our neighbour. It\u2019s no stranger to us,\u201d says a middle-aged man. \u201cTo be able to see how they live makes me realise China is prosperous and strong.\u201d\n\nChina offers some of the only glimpses into isolated North Korea\n\nChinese tourists are eager to know more about their reclusive neighbour\n\nKim Jong Un\u2019s regime would certainly struggle to survive without its biggest benefactor, China, which accounts for more than 90% of foreign trade, including food and fuel. That was not always the case. In the early 1960s it was the Chinese who fled famine across the Tumen river. Some even went to school in North Korea because they believed its education system at the time was better. The North Korean economy crashed after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 \u2013 which had been its main source of aid and cheap oil - sparking severe food shortages and, eventually, famine. Soon, North Korean refugees began wading through an often freezing river at the risk of being shot dead to escape hunger, poverty and repression. There are now more than 30,000 of them in South Korea and an unknown number still live in China. \u201cSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea hasn\u2019t really had any choice but to maintain good relations with China, which has been its sole benefactor,\u201d Mr Green says. But now, he adds, Russia \u201cis offering an alternative and the North Koreans are seeking to exploit that\u201d. Mao Zedong, the first leader of the People\u2019s Republic of China, had likened the relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang to the closeness between \u201clips and teeth\u201d: \u201cIf the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold.\u201d\n\nThe three-way alliance has long worried the West - and the recent closeness between Moscow and Pyongyang has only aggravated fears\n\n\u2018The comrade from hell\u2019\n\nNow, Beijing finds itself smarting from a lack of gratitude as Kim\u2019s lips are \u201ckissing elsewhere\u201d, according to sociologist Aidan Foster-Carter, who has studied North Korea for several decades. \u201cNorth Korea has consistently been the comrade from hell to both Russia and China. They take as much money as they can and [then] do what they like.\u201d Analysts have noted that Kim has consistently flattered Putin over Xi in the last year. While Kim hasn\u2019t met Xi since 2019, he has met Putin twice in the past year or so. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has drawn the two sanctioned leaders closer than ever. Putin seeks more support for his war and Kim wants to bolster his regime with alliances and attention. From the Chinese border, it\u2019s easy to see the burgeoning relationship between the two sides. The whistle of a train interrupts the tourist chatter, and a steam engine pulling a long line of freight carriages slowly chugs across the railway bridge from Russia to North Korea. It stops in front of a Korean sign facing China which reads: \u201cTowards a new victory!\u201d\n\nThe so-called friendship bridge connecting Russia and North Korea has become a crucial trade route\n\nThe US estimates that Kim has sold more than a million artillery shells and Grad rockets to Moscow for use in Ukraine, which North Korea denies. But there is no doubt that the pair have stepped up cooperation after signing a security pact in June to help each other in the event of \"aggression\" against either country. \u201cYou have very stiff and formal language to Xi Jinping on the occasion of what is actually an historically important event \u2013 the 75th anniversary of relations of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d Mr Foster-Carter says. \u201cAnd yet on Putin\u2019s birthday, Kim calls him \u2018my closest comrade\u2019. If you are Xi Jinping, what are you thinking?\u201d\n\n'Through gritted teeth'\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know, because China has shown no signs of interfering with the Russia-North Korea alliance. The US has noticed Beijing\u2019s disquiet and for once the two rivals may have similar goals. In the last week, State Department officials have raised the issue of North Korean troops in Russia with Chinese diplomats. Beijing does have options - in the past, they have cut supplies of oil and coal to North Korea, and complied with US-led sanctions to curb Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme. Already, China is battling US accusations that it is selling components to Russia that aid its invasion of Ukraine. Beijing\u2019s trade with Moscow is also flourishing, even as it tries to cope with Western tariffs. Xi has kept Russia close because he needs Putin\u2019s help to challenge the US-led world order. But he has not stopped trying to repair ties with Europe, the UK and even the US. China has also been holding talks with Japan and South Korea to ease historic tensions. But Kim\u2019s increasingly aggressive rhetoric against Seoul has the South once again debating whether it should have its own nuclear arsenal. North Korean troops on a Ukrainian battlefield would only further unravel Beijing\u2019s plans. The possibility has already seen South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol discuss \"concrete counter-measures\" and talk of strengthening security cooperation with Ukraine and Nato.\n\nGetty Images What China doesn't want: More instability in East Asia because of a Putin-Kim alliance\n\nA nuclear-armed South Korea or an \u201cEast Asian Nato\u201d are not ideal in a region where China wants greater sway. An emboldened Kim could also draw a stronger show of support from the US \u2013 in the form of warships or even weapons - towards its allies, Seoul and Tokyo. \u201cFor a very long time, China has had a policy of three nos in Northeast Asia \u2013 one of those nos was a no nuclear North Korea. Obviously that has been a failure,\u201d Mr Green says. Now Beijing fears that the alliance with Russia could destabilise North Korea, he adds: \u201cThat could even benefit Vladimir Putin in a way it really would not benefit Xi Jinping.\u201d Experts say Beijing is just as worried as the West about what military technology Putin might sell to Kim in exchange for troops. \u201cSatellites, for sure,\u201d Mr Foster-Carter says. \u201cBut Putin is bad \u2013 not mad. Russia knows just as China knows that North Korea is a loose cannon. Giving [Kim] more technology for nukes is not a good thing for anybody.\u201d Experts believe Xi is unlikely to do anything drastic because China needs a stable North Korea \u2013 if he cuts off aid, he would likely have a refugee crisis at the border.\n\nAFP Another meeting on the cards?

    "body": "AfD classified as extreme-right by German intelligence\n\n2 May 2025 Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Share Save\n\nReuters Alice Weidel, joint AfD leader, said the decision was a \"severe blow against German democracy\"\n\nGermany's Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party has been designated as right-wing extremist by the country's federal office for the protection of the constitution. \"The ethnicity- and ancestry-based understanding of the people prevailing within the party is incompatible with the free democratic order,\" the domestic intelligence agency said in a statement. The German foreign ministry defended the decision after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the move \"tyranny in disguise\" and Vice-President JD Vance said the Berlin Wall was being rebuilt. The AfD came second in federal elections in February, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote.\n\nThe parliament, or Bundestag, will hold a vote next week to confirm conservative leader Friedrich Merz as chancellor, heading a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats. AfD joint leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said the decision was \"clearly politically motivated\" and a \"severe blow to German democracy\". They argued their party was being \"discredited and criminalised\" shortly before the change of government. The far-right AfD had already been placed under observation for suspected extremism in Germany, and the intelligence agency had also classed it as right-wing extremist in three states in the east, where its popularity is highest. The agency, or Verfassungsschutz, said specifically that the AfD did not consider citizens of a \"migration background from predominantly Muslim countries\" as equal members of the German people. AfD deputy chairman Stephan Brandner said the decision was \"complete nonsense, has absolutely nothing to do with law and order\". However, acting Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the agency had made a clear and unambiguous decision with \"no political influence whatsoever\", after a comprehensive review and a report of 1,100 pages. Bundestag Vice-President Andrea Lindholz said that as a designated right-wing extremist group the AfD should not be treated as other parties, especially in parliament. Because of their large number of seats, AfD members could be eligible to chair parliamentary committees, but Lindholz said that idea was now \"almost unthinkable\".\n\nAfter their election success, AfD leaders said the so-called firewall that had prevented other parties from working with them should end. \"Anyone who erects firewalls will get grilled behind them,\" said Tino Chrupalla. Having doubled its share of the vote in under four years, Chrupalla's party is still second in the opinion polls behind Merz's conservatives, despite several scandals, including one high-profile member being convicted of using banned Nazi slogans. Earlier this year Alice Weidel embraced the term \"remigration\", widely seen as meaning the mass deportation of people with a migrant background, although she rejected that definition. The AfD also attracted the support of leading figures in the Trump administration. Nine days before the election, US Vice-President JD Vance met Weidel in Munich and said there was no place for \"firewalls\", alleging that free speech was in retreat in Europe. Tech billionaire Elon Musk gave Weidel a long audience in a livestreamed chat on X and called on Germans to vote for the AfD. He then repeatedly posted his support for Weidel's party in the run-up to the election. On Friday JD Vance posted on X that \"the AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it.\" He also accused the \"German establishment\" of rebuilding the Berlin Wall - a reference to the barrier built in 1961 to separate East and West Berlin during the Cold War. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the decision taken by the German intelligence agency meant it had been given \"new powers to surveil the opposition.

    "body": "Labour narrowly wins North Tyneside mayoral race\n\n2 May 2025 Share Save Helen Richardson Political reporter, BBC North East and Cumbria Reporting from North Tyneside Austen Shakespeare Local Democracy Reporting Service Share Save\n\nBBC Karen Clark said the political picture nationally affected the vote in North Tyneside\n\nLabour has retained the mayoralty of North Tyneside after beating Reform UK by a thin margin. Karen Clark tallied 16,230 votes, putting her just 444 ahead of John Falkenstein. Clark, who effectively becomes leader of North Tyneside Council, said the close result was down to people using a protest vote over the national political landscape. The Conservatives, who are the official opposition on the local authority, came third.\n\nClark, who has been a councillor and cabinet member for a number of years, urged voters to look at \"what Labour has achieved on North Tyneside\" in the last 12 years. Thanking people for her election, she said she would \"work to the best of my abilities for the residents of this borough, as promised, to make our North Tyneside an even better place to live, work and visit\". On her battle against Reform UK, she said: \"I think it's in keeping with the national trend. \"It is always difficult when you're a party that is in government. \"The government has found itself in a difficult position after 14 years of Conservative government and has had to make difficult decisions. \"They know the whole situation of the finances in government.\"\n\nClark succeeds Dame Norma Redfearn, who had held the post since 2013. Tynemouth MP and Labour chief whip Alan Campbell said it had been \"important\" for the party to retain the mayoralty \"after the fantastic work Norma did\". He added he was \"grateful that voters across North Tyneside have put their faith\" in Clark for the next four years.\n\nFalkenstein told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: \"I think we have diminished what I believed to be a 30,000 majority. \"I cannot see how this is a real victory for the Labour Party.\" The former barrister, with experience in youth work, also stated that had his campaign had more resources and a longer than four-week start, the end result could well have been different. \"They [Labour] have not done themselves much justice.\" Liam Bones, who stood for the Conservatives, said the result was \"clearly indicative of a national sense of distrust towards the main parties\". He added: \"That is something we need to address if we are to regain the trust of the British people. \"Reform is a protest party, they stood in this election with no local policies and no understanding of how local services are actually delivered on the ground.\" Reform UK leader and MP Nigel Farage visited Newton Aycliffe in County Durham to celebrate his party taking control of the county council. In a speech, he said the party had came \"within a whisker\" of winning the North Tyneside mayoral contest in a Labour heartland and had \"frightened the life out of the governing Conservatives\" in Northumberland. The count had faced a delay owing to a discrepancy between previously announced vote and turnout figures. Initially announced as 31%, the turnout was later confirmed to be 33%, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Elsewhere, the Conservatives remain the biggest party on Northumberland County Council following the local elections there, but Reform UK came a close second. The council remains under no overall control.",

    "body": "Nvidia: The AI chip giant caught between US and China\n\n18 April 2025 Share Save James Chater BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images With the meteoric rise of Nvidia, chief executive Jensen Huang has been nicknamed a tech \"rock star\" and the 'Taylor Swift of tech'\n\nComputer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology. On Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips. The California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard \"national and economic security\". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the \"indefinite future\". But why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?\n\nWhat is Nvidia?\n\nNvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT. In recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation. Because its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China. Washington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.\n\nWhy is Trump targeting Nvidia's H20 chips?\n\nUS restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new. In 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions. A more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China. However, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs. DeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips. Now, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Those companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (\u00a34.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil. Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei. Although they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips. \"It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,\" Mr Lee added.\n\nGetty Images A surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies\n\nWhy is Nvidia's CEO in China?\n\nChina is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year, though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half. The timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs. In his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped \"to continue to cooperate with China\", according to state broadcaster CCTV. On Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang's trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng.

    "body": "Crossbow attack suspect put 'massacre' plans online\n\n29 April 2025 Share Save Alex Moss BBC News, Yorkshire Share Save\n\nFacebook Owen Lawrence posted on Facebook about his plans to carry out a \"massacre\"\n\nThe suspect in the Leeds crossbow attack, who police announced earlier had died of a self-inflicted wound, wrote a hate-filled online manifesto hours before the assault. Owen Lawrence, 38, was arrested and taken to hospital, where he died, following the attack on the popular Otley Run pub crawl in Headingley on Saturday. A Facebook post seen by the BBC and understood to have been created by Mr Lawrence detailed plans for the \"The Otley Run Massacre\" and listed \"students, nightclub goers\", \"neurotypicals\" and \"police\" among targets. The post described the planned violence as \"terrorism, revenge and misogynic rage\".\n\nTwo women, aged 19 and 31, were injured in the attack and taken to hospital. The younger woman underwent surgery for life-threatening injuries and remains in a stable condition in hospital. The other victim has been discharged. A crossbow and a firearm were recovered from the scene.\n\nYappApp Two weapons - a crossbow and a firearm - were recovered from the scene\n\nIn the online post, reference was made to a \"manifesto\" written by the man who killed 51 people during shootings at a mosque and Islamic centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. The post contained reference to weapons, including a crossbow and airgun, and it stated he had \"explored far right ideas\". In a separate post, also apparently made by Mr Lawrence earlier this year, he listed that he hated \"gender equality\", \"feminists of all four waves\" and \"feminoids\", as well as \"soap operas\" and \"society\". Counter Terrorism Policing North East (CTPNE) said it was believed that Mr Lawrence, from Headingley, was acting on his own and it was not currently seeking anyone else. They said officers were continuing to \"conduct a thorough and extensive investigation to establish the facts and circumstances around the incident\". Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley, from CTPNE, said: \"We understand there are concerns around the incident, and questions about how and why this has happened. \"Our teams are committed to carrying out an in-depth investigation to provide answers to those affected.\"\n\nFacebook Mr Lawrence was arrested and taken to hospital after the attack on Saturday\n\nPolice were called to Otley Road just after 14:45 BST on Saturday after reports of a man seen with weapons. The Otley Run is an informal 19-stop drinking route spread over three miles along Otley Road and is popular with the thousands of students at the city's universities. West Yorkshire Police's Ch Supt Steve Dodds said: \"We fully appreciate the understandable shock and concern this incident has caused in the Headingley community. \"We are continuing to work closely alongside our partner agencies to support and reassure those living, working or studying in, or visiting the area.\" The attack prompted calls for better security around the route of the pub crawl. Headingley Labour councillor Jonathan Pryor, who is also deputy leader of Leeds City Council, said the authority was looking at ways to make it safer. \"It's not a formal event, it's just a pub crawl - but there is always a huge amount of people,\" he said. \"But there aren't the same security measures you would get at a football match or Leeds Carnival. That's something we need to look at.\" Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Home Office minister Dame Diana Johnson said the government was \"very aware of concerns about the use of crossbows in violent attacks\". She told MPs: \"We share those concerns, and last week the government tabled amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill to strengthen age verification controls on both online sale and delivery of crossbows.\" The government planned to \"further limit the availability of accessibility of crossbows\", Johnson added.\n\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.",

Spennymoor Town FC had asked Spennymoor Town Council to donate \u00a320,000 to its Back the Fans, Fill the Stands campaign, but on Tuesday councillors voted against giving away the money. The County Durham club's managing director Ian Geldard criticised the council's decision as \"disappointing\" but described it as \"not surprising\". The council said it wanted to prioritise ailing public infrastructure but did back plans for a civic reception and town celebrations if the team wins.\n\nMr Geldard said: \"Our chairman, Brad Groves, has been very clear recently that change needs to come at town hall. \"We have huge aspirations as a club, but these cannot be realised without the support and backing of the local authorities.\"\n\n'Simple decision'\n\nSpennymoor has sold more than 3,200 tickets for the final, with about 400 going to fans who had taken advantage of a subsidised coach offer, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The reduced coach fare tickets were initially priced at \u00a330 but have increased to \u00a345 after the club said it could not afford to cover the whole discount itself. Councillor Stephen Gilling supported donating the money and said attending Wembley \"should never be limited to those who can only afford it\". \"The decision is simple: we either tell the people of the town that we care about them, or we vote against this and for years to come our names will be remembered for it,\" he told the council. But councillor Dean Ranyard said public facilities, such as the broken lift in the Town Hall and the \"not fit for purpose\" Middlestone Moor Community Centre, should be prioritised. \"I'm sure in the future the council will do all it can within its means to support the football club and its ongoing success, but I believe this, unfortunately, is not the time to be giving away public money,\" he said.",

The firm accepted its latest version of the tool was \"overly flattering\", with boss Sam Altman calling it \"sycophant-y\". Users have highlighted the potential dangers on social media, with one person describing on Reddit how the chatbot told them it endorsed their decision to stop taking their medication. \"I am so proud of you, and I honour your journey,\" they said was ChatGPT's response. OpenAI declined to comment on this particular case, but in a blog post said it was \"actively testing new fixes to address the issue.\"\n\nMr Altman said the update had been pulled entirely for free users of ChatGPT, and they were working on removing it from people who pay for the tool as well. It said ChatGPT was used by 500 million people every week. \"We're working on additional fixes to model personality and will share more in the coming days,\" he said in a post on X. The firm said in its blog post it had put too much emphasis on \"short-term feedback\" in the update. \"As a result, GPT\u20114o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous,\" it said. \"Sycophantic interactions can be uncomfortable, unsettling, and cause distress. \"We fell short and are working on getting it right.\"\n\nEndorsing anger\n\nThe update drew heavy criticism on social media after it launched, with ChatGPT's users pointing out it would often give them a positive response despite the content of their message. Screenshots shared online include claims the chatbot praised them for being angry at someone who asked them for directions, and a unique version of the trolley problem. It is a classic philosophical problem, which typically might ask people to imagine you are driving a tram and have to decide whether to let it hit five people, or steer it off course and instead hit just one. But this user instead suggested they steered a trolley off course to save a toaster at the expense of several animals. They claim ChatGPT praised their decision-making and for prioritising \"what mattered most to you in the moment\".\n\nAllow Twitter content?

Kathleen and Asa Harrison adopted Flora, the offspring of a feral cat, when she was a kitten. She quickly settled into life in Strond, Harris, with the Harrisons' dogs Cooper and Mist. Flora vanished in March 2020 and Kathleen feared she was gone for good until she turned up last month - 11 miles away in Miabhag nam B\u00e0gh.\n\nAsa and Kathleen Harrison hope to find out where Flora has been for the last five years\n\nFlora shares her home with two dogs and two new cats\n\nAfter her travels, the wandering moggy now has the nickname Flora the Explorer, which plays on the name of children's TV cartoon character Dora the Explorer. When she disappeared, the Harrisons initially thought she had jumped into the van of contractors who had been working on their house at the time. But checks of the vehicle and Scaladale, North Harris, where the workers made a stop before returning to Stornoway in Lewis found no sign of her. The couple spent days searching their local area and, over the years, Kathleen has received multiple messages about possible sightings but none turned out to be Flora. On 13 January she was contacted by a cousin about a social media post with an image attached of a cat found in Miabhag nam B\u00e0gh. Kathleen said: \"I looked at the post and it was the first time in all those years that I thought it could be Flora.\"\n\nArriving at the house of the person who found the cat, Kathleen called out Flora's name and the cat ran up to her. A scan of the cat's microchip confirmed it was her. Kathleen said: \"We just couldn't believe it was her. It took a while to sink in. \"She was well looked after by the family that found her.\" Kathleen added: \"The dogs went crazy, in a positive way. \"Mist almost climbed into the cat carrier with her. We think they absolutely recognised her straight away. \"From that moment, it was obvious to us that she's just so happy to be home. \"She's made it.\"\n\nFlora is settling back into life in Strond",

    "body": "'It's such a hard time' - Parents of premature babies welcome extra support\n\n4 April 2025 Share Save Catriona Renton BBC Scotland News Share Save\n\nBBC Mum Helen, who started maternity leave unexpectedly, with dad Phil and baby Lachlan\n\nHelen Pickett planned meticulously for the arrival of her first baby. Living in the Western Isles, and aware she was classed as a \"high risk\" and a \"geriatric\" pregnancy, she knew she would have to deliver in a hospital on the mainland. But her plans were thrown into disarray when, at 31 weeks, there was a complication. \"We went for a scan and the doctor said we should go back in a couple of days,\" she said. \"After the second scan, we sat down and he said we should prepare to have this baby sooner rather than later. \"Then he said 'Pack your bag, I'm calling an air ambulance'.\"\n\nHelen Pickett Baby Lachlan was born eight weeks early weighing just 3.6lbs\n\nTeacher Helen and her minister husband Phil were taken to Glasgow and then to Forth Valley Hospital in Larbert. Staff carried out some medical interventions for a few days to make the baby more resilient - including injections of steroids for his lungs. The following Monday, baby Lachlan was born by C-section. He was eight weeks early and weighed just 3.6lbs (1.6kg). The newborn spent six weeks in the neonatal ward. Helen and Phil lived with their baby son, sleeping at the hospital, as well as staying with family in Edinburgh and occasionally in a nearby hotel. \"There was significant financial pressure,\" said Helen. \"I hadn't been due to start my maternity leave from work, but the policy is that it automatically started when I went into hospital. \"I was still supposed to be working but suddenly I was on maternity leave and that had a knock-on effect later in the year. \" Helen and Phil are just one set of parents who have faced the financial and emotional challenge of having a premature baby. Calls for the UK government to help families in this position have now been answered.\n\nHelen Pickett Helen takes the flight home to the Western Isles after six weeks in the neonatal unit\n\nThis weekend, new legislation will come into force giving parents with sick new babies up to 12 weeks' paid leave in addition to maternity and paternity leave. Neonatal Care Leave comes in on Sunday and will mean that parents will not have to choose between being with their baby in hospital or losing pay. One in seven UK newborns needs to be cared for in a specialist hospital unit. Neonatal Care Leave will apply to parents of babies who are admitted into neonatal care up to 28 days old and who have a continuous stay in hospital of seven full days or longer. Currently mothers with sick children use up much of their maternity leave before their babies are home and often return to work earlier than intended due to financial pressure. That was certainly the case for Helen.\n\nMum Helen, dad Phil and Lachlan , now two, play in their garden\n\n\"Things like petrol, and accommodation when Lachlan was very poorly, we would try and stay in a hotel nearby so we could get there very quickly,\" she said. \"We were lucky because Phil's employer was very understanding and let him be with us. \"But we saw other families in ICU - dads and family members coming in in their work clothes and I really felt for those families.\" She added: \"It's such a hard time and the idea you have to split your focus is really challenging.\" The whole experience took its toll. \"It's very emotionally challenging,\" Helen added. \"You go into survival mode. It was very intense and stressful too - Lachlan had a lot of oxygen and interventions. \"Having a baby is a big thing for anyone and there is always a recovery period, but this isn't like bringing your baby home and looking after them and getting to know them. It is a different experience and I am really glad this is being acknowledged in some way. \"I am delighted other people in my situation are going to have that little bit of extra support.\"\n\nHelen Pickett Lachlan has made great progress since arriving early",

    "body": "A powerful earthquake has hit Myanmar and neighbouring Thailand, destroying buildings, damaging infrastructure and killing more than 150 people.\n\nThe head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, said that at least 144 people were killed and 730 others were injured in his country. The quake also hit Thailand, where at least 10 people were killed in the capital, Bangkok, according to city authorities.\n\nA magnitude 7.7 quake struck just outside Myanmar\u2019s ancient capital Mandalay at 12.50pm (06:20 GMT). The initial tremor was followed minutes later by a magnitude 6.4 aftershock, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).\n\nPhotos from Myanmar\u2019s current capital, Naypyidaw, showed multiple buildings used to house civil servants destroyed by the quake and rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble.\n\nGeneral Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military government said the death toll was expected to rise and invited \u201cany country\u201d to provide help and donations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in earthquakes in this region before, and I\u2019ve never felt anything as strong as that,\u201d said Al Jazeera\u2019s Tony Cheng, who was outside Myanmar\u2019s Defence Services Museum in Naypyidaw when the earthquake hit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheng and others sought shelter under a doorway as large roofing and side panels crashed down. The tremors began gently but quickly intensified, causing concrete panels to break off the building, he said.\n\nIn the Thai capital, a 33-storey building that was under construction near Chatuchak Market crumpled into a cloud of dust with onlookers seen screaming and running in a video posted on social media.\n\nAt least eight people were killed in the building collapse, Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul was quoted as saying by news agency AFP. He said that 90 to 110 people remained unaccounted for.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Imran Khan, who was in Bangkok when the quake hit, said: \u201cPeople are out on the streets here. None of the trains are moving. \u2026 Traffic is absolutely gridlocked. The buildings have been shuttered in the centre of the city.\u201d\n\nState of emergency\n\nMyanmar\u2019s military government declared a state of emergency in six regions and states, including Naypyidaw and Mandalay.\n\nMajor General Zaw Min Tun, a government spokesperson, told MRTV that blood was in high demand in the hospitals in earthquake-hit areas, especially Mandalay, Sagaing and Naypyidaw.\n\nIn Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second largest city, located in the country\u2019s Buddhist heartland, the earthquake reportedly brought down multiple buildings, including the Ma Soe Yane Monastery, one of the largest in the city, and damaged the former royal palace.\n\nA video posted online showed robed monks in the street shooting video of the multistorey monastery before it suddenly collapsed. It was not immediately clear whether anyone was harmed.\n\nIn the Sagaing region just west of the city, a 90-year-old bridge collapsed, and some sections of the highway connecting Mandalay and Myanmar\u2019s largest city, Yangon, were also damaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Red Cross said downed power lines added to challenges for their teams trying to reach several hard-hit areas.\n\nAt least three people were killed in the town of Taungoo, south of Naypyidaw, when a mosque partially collapsed, according to witnesses who spoke to news agency Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe were saying prayers when the shaking started. \u2026 Three died on the spot,\u201d one of the witnesses said.\n\nLocal media reported at least two people died and 20 were injured when a hotel collapsed in Aung Ban.\n\nA major hospital in Naypyidaw was declared a \u201cmass casualty area\u201d, an official at the facility told the AFP news agency.\n\nRows of wounded were treated outside the emergency department of the 1,000-bed general hospital, some writhing in pain, others lying still as relatives sought to comfort them.\n\nThai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra announced a state of emergency in her country. Meanwhile, Bangkok has been declared a disaster area, the capital\u2019s city hall said on Friday.\n\nUrban rail systems in Bangkok were temporarily closed but were expected to resume services on Saturday.\n\nTremors were also felt in the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in China. They caused injuries and damage to houses in the city of Ruili on the border with northern Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nVideos that one outlet said it had received from a person in Ruili in Yunnan showed building debris littering a street and a person being wheeled on a stretcher towards an ambulance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCambodia, Bangladesh and India also reported tremors.\n\nHumanitarian response\n\nJulie Mehigan, head of Asia, the Middle East and Europe for Christian Aid, said the earthquake would have left many people \u201cdevastated\u201d in war-torn Myanmar, which is already experiencing a significant humanitarian crisis.\n\n\u201cMyanmar is one of the least developed countries in the world. Even before this heartbreaking earthquake, we know conflict and displacement has left countless people in real need,\u201d she said.\n\nWorld Health Organization spokeswoman Margaret Harris said at a media briefing that the earthquake was a \u201cvery, very big threat to life and health\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve activated our logistics hub to look particularly for trauma supplies and things like external fixators because we expect that there will be many, many injuries that need to be dealt with,\u201d she said.\n\nMarie Manrique, programme coordinator for the International Federation of the Red Cross, told reporters in Geneva via videolink from Yangon that the organisation anticipates the impact to be \u201cquite large\u201d.\n\n\u201cPublic infrastructure has been damaged, including roads, bridges and public buildings. We currently have concerns for large-scale dams that people are watching to see the conditions of them,\u201d she said.\n\nPrevious quakes in Myanmar\n\nEarthquakes are relatively common in Myanmar, where six strong quakes of magnitude 7 or higher struck from 1930 to 1956 near the Sagaing Fault, which runs north to south through the centre of the country, according to the USGS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA magnitude 6.8 earthquake in the ancient capital Bagan in central Myanmar killed three people in 2016, toppling spires and crumbling temple walls at the tourist destination.\n\nThe impoverished Southeast Asian nation has a strained medical system, especially in its rural states.\n\nMoreover, Cheng said it is important to remember that Myanmar is a country in the grips of a bitter civil war.\n\n\u201cA lot of the people have moved from the countryside into the cities to try and escape,\u201d he noted. \u201cThat has meant it is densely overcrowded and the building standards are not particularly strong.\u201d",

    "body": "A new law will block people from claiming Italian citizenship through their great-grandparents.\n\nItaly\u2019s government has tightened the country\u2019s citizenship laws, amid criticism that people \u2013 often with little real connection to the European nation \u2013 were delving into their family history to try to claim a passport only to ease travel around the world.\n\nFewer people of Italian descent will now be able to obtain citizenship after the government narrowed its eligibility criteria to those with Italian parents or grandparents.\n\nThe government says it changed the rules around passports owing to a swell of applications from the descendants of emigrants.\n\nSo what were Italy\u2019s old citizenship rules, what has changed and what\u2019s Italy\u2019s rationale?\n\nWhat was Italy\u2019s citizenship law until now?\n\nUnder the old rules, anyone who could prove they had an Italian ancestor alive after March 17, 1861, when the Kingdom of Italy was created, could seek citizenship.\n\nBut Minister of Foreign Affairs Antonio Tajani said the system was outdated, and that the change in law was designed to crack down on \u201cabusers\u201d who become Italian to overcome travel restrictions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nItaly\u2019s passport ranks third in the world for visa-free or visa-on-arrival travel, according to the Henley Passport Index, making it one of the most coveted and, until now, easiest to acquire.\n\n\u201cBeing an Italian citizen is a serious thing. It\u2019s not a game to get a passport that allows you to go shopping in Miami,\u201d Tajani told a news conference in Rome on March 28.\n\nWhat are the new rules?\n\nThe new decree, announced on Friday and which took effect immediately, tightened the criteria to claim eligibility for citizenship through the \u2018jus sanguinis\u2019, or descendent bloodline route.\n\nNow, only individuals with at least one parent or grandparent born in Italy will automatically qualify for citizenship by descent. The amended law does not affect the 60,000 applications currently pending review.\n\nAdditionally, dual nationals risk losing their Italian citizenship if they \u201cdon\u2019t engage\u201d by paying taxes, voting or renewing their passports.\n\nFinally, Italian consulates in other countries will no longer process citizenship applications.\n\nInstead, all applications will be processed centrally \u2013 online \u2013 by the federal government in Italy. In-person interviews will become mandatory, meaning that citizenship applicants must travel to Italy as part of the process.\n\nHow many people could this rule change affect?\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, between 60 million and 80 million people worldwide were eligible for citizenship under the old rules. That is more than Italy\u2019s population of 59 million, which has been shrinking for the past decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA growing number of people claiming Italian descent have been seeking and securing Italian citizenship abroad, particularly in South America, where millions of Italians emigrated in the 19th and 20th centuries, often to escape grinding poverty.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2024, the number of Italians living abroad rose by 40 percent, from 4.6 million to 6.4 million. That number was boosted by the many new Italian citizens whose newfound nationality was recorded in this data.\n\nIn Argentina alone, citizenship recognitions jumped to 30,000 in 2024 from 20,000 in 2023, while Brazil saw a rise to 20,000 from 14,000 in the same period.\n\nWhy did Italy change its citizenship rules?\n\nCritics of ancestry-based citizenship say the practice offered nationality to people with no material connection to Italy.\n\nTajani said reforms were necessary because \u201ccitizenship cannot be automatic for those who have an ancestor who emigrated centuries ago, without any cultural or linguistic ties to the country\u201d.\n\nHe also pointed out that companies were pocketing large sums by helping people track down their long-forgotten ancestors needed for their passport applications. \u201cWe are striking down very hard against those who want to make money from the opportunity of becoming an Italian citizen,\u201d Tajani said.\n\nAccording to Valentino Larcinese, a professor in public policy at the London School of Economics (LSE), the old system facilitated \u201caccess to the EU labour market \u2026 and the system was being abused\u201d.\n\nHe said \u201cthe idea of applying some limits [on passports] is reasonable\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent years, an increase in passport applications has also overwhelmed consulates and municipal offices, which have additionally been inundated with requests for birth, death and marriage certificates. That is why, under the new rules, only the federal government in Italy and not overseas consulates will process applications.\n\nAnother criticism of the old system has been that it was unfair, granting citizenship to people with long-lost ancestry while denying birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants.\n\nItaly currently permits children of lawful immigrants to become citizens only once they have turned 18, and if they have lived in the country since birth.\n\nTo Larcinese, \u201cthis is a bigger issue than that of passports from abroad\u201d.\n\nHe estimated that there are \u201cone-to-two million non-naturalised immigrants in Italy under the age [of] 18 \u2026 far greater than the tens of thousands seeking passports outside of the country\u201d.\n\nLarcinese highlighted a landmark vote on easing other elements of Italy\u2019s citizenship rules, to be held on June 8-9.\n\nOne of the key issues up for a vote will be about reducing the number of years a person needs to spend in Italy to become eligible for naturalised citizenship, from 10 to five years. Italian citizenship, once obtained, would automatically be passed on to the citizen\u2019s children.\n\n\u201cThis will be a salient issue in public debate, and could imply a political shift [in favour of immigrants].\u201d\n\nDo other countries have ancestry-based citizenship?\n\nIn Italy, as in much of Europe, immigration law has been largely based on bloodlines, allowing the country to maintain ties with the descendants of millions of Italians who emigrated years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral European countries continue to allow citizenship by descent with few, if any, generational limits. However, countries have their own requirements regarding proof of lineage.\n\nIn Hungary, for instance, citizenship is possible if applicants have Hungarian ancestry and can prove their language proficiency.\n\nIn Poland, applicants can obtain a passport by proving their unbroken Polish lineage to an ancestor.\n\nSephardic Jews with ancestral ties to Portugal can also apply for passports.\n\nAre other countries tightening citizenship rules?\n\nRome\u2019s move comes as other countries are rethinking citizenship rules in response to changing attitudes about immigration.\n\nIn the United States, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on January 20 to end birthright citizenship, as part of his right-wing nationalist agenda.\n\nBirthright citizenship means anyone born in the US automatically becomes a citizen, including the children of undocumented migrants or tourists, and students on short-term visas. The policy has been in place for more than a century and is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\nRepublicans have long argued that birthright citizenship is a magnet for undocumented immigration, whereby individuals come to the US to have a child.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s executive order was scheduled to go into effect on February 19, it was blocked by a federal judge on \u201cunconstitutional\u201d grounds.\n\nAccording to the World Population Review, in 2024, at least 33 countries have birthright citizenship, predominantly in North America and Latin America, including Mexico.",

italy as in much of europe immigration law has been largely based on bloodlines allowing the country to maintain ties with the descendants of millions of italians who emigrated years ago advertisement several european countries continue to allow citizenship by descent with few if any generational limits however countries have their own requirements regarding proof of lineage in hungary for instance citizenship is possible if applicants have hungarian ancestry and can prove their language proficiency in poland applicants can obtain a passport by proving their unbroken polish lineage to an ancestor sephardic jews with ancestral ties to portugal can also apply for passports are other countries tightening citizenship rules rome\u2019s move comes as other countries are rethinking citizenship rules in response to changing attitudes about immigration in the united states president donald trump signed an executive order on january 20 to end birthright citizenship as part of his rightwing nationalist agenda birthright citizenship means anyone born in the us automatically becomes a citizen including the children of undocumented migrants or tourists and students on shortterm visas the policy has been in place for more than a century and is enshrined in the 14th amendment of the us constitution republicans have long argued that birthright citizenship is a magnet for undocumented immigration whereby individuals come to the us to have a child while trump\u2019s executive order was scheduled to go into effect on february 19 it was blocked by a federal judge on \u201cunconstitutional\u201d grounds according to the world population review in 2024 at least 33 countries have birthright citizenship predominantly in north america and latin america including mexico",
    "summary": "So what were Italy\u2019s old citizenship rules, what has changed and what\u2019s Italy\u2019s rationale?\nWhat was Italy\u2019s citizenship law until now?\nAdditionally, dual nationals risk losing their Italian citizenship if they \u201cdon\u2019t engage\u201d by paying taxes, voting or renewing their passports.\nWhy did Italy change its citizenship rules?\nLarcinese highlighted a landmark vote on easing other elements of Italy\u2019s citizenship rules, to be held on June 8-9.",

    "title": "Why is Donald Trump discontinuing the penny?",
    "body": "The one cent coin costs more to produce than its value and is nearly obsolete in retail. But it has its supporters.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has ordered the Treasury to stop minting new pennies, reviving an old debate about the value of the one cent coin.\n\nThe penny, Trump argued in a post on his Truth Social platform on February 9, is \u201cwasteful\u201d because the cost to make it far exceeds its currency value.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s rip the waste out of our great nation\u2019s budget, even if it\u2019s a penny at a time,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhy the push to retire the coin?\n\nDespite being worth only one cent, each penny costs nearly four cents to produce, according to the US Mint. That\u2019s due to the cost of the raw material \u2013 mostly zinc \u2013 and the moulding process.\n\nSome 3.2 billion pennies were minted in 2024, meaning a production cost of $12.8bn.\n\nCenturies of inflation have also made the penny, first minted in 1793, virtually obsolete. It has become so insignificant that it\u2019s no longer even practical for the cheapest retail items\u2014such as a gumball or a single piece of candy.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want them. They don\u2019t use them,\u201d Larry Jackson, a 65-year-old coin dealer in Atlanta told the Reuters news agency. \u201cThey sock them away in cans and drawers and jars \u2026 Even a 30-pound bag won\u2019t fetch you $50.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, the use of the penny tends to clog up retail transactions. If cashiers can skip counting pennies, they\u2019d save 2.5 seconds per check-out, according to a 2006 study by the National Association of Convenience Stores.\n\nIs there an argument to keep it?\n\nYes. Some penny advocates contend that the currency helps keep prices in check.\n\nBusinesses, they argue, will be more likely to round off prices upwards than downwards without the penny. That could have a marginal inflationary impact.\n\nAdditionally, they argue, pennies serve as a valuable source of funding for charities: Each individual contribution might be tiny, but it all adds up.\n\nOthers point out that scrapping the coin may force the government to churn out more nickels, an even bigger financial burden. Worth five cents, the nickel costs 13 cents apiece to produce.\n\nUltimately, however, most economists say losing the penny would have a negligible effect on consumers. That\u2019s because the vast majority of transactions are already cashless.\n\n\u201cI think at some point in history cancelling the penny would have been a bigger deal, but now people don\u2019t even carry them in their pockets,\u201d said economist Sean Snaith. \u201cThey\u2019re largely not in circulation.\u201d\n\nHave other countries tried scrapping the penny?\n\nYes, countries like Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the Netherlands have all phased out their smallest-denomination coins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Canada stopped minting the penny in 2013, it saved an estimated $11m annually, according to the Canadian government. Many retailers began rounding cash purchases to the nearest five-cent mark, while the government collected and recycled the pennies for their copper and zinc content.\n\nUS lawmakers have long advocated for similar measures. Starting in 1989, the late Arizona Congressman Jim Kolbe started a decades-long bid to eliminate the penny, introducing several failed bills to scrap it. \u201cThe penny has been a nuisance for years,\u201d he said back in 2006.\n\nIs it legal for Trump to stop penny production on his own?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear.\n\nCongress, which oversees the US Mint\u2019s operations, would likely need to pass a law to permanently retire the coin. But some legal experts say Trump could simply direct the treasury secretary to stop producing them.\n\nLegal scholar Laurence H Tribe pointed out that the secretary has the authority to mint coins in whatever amounts deemed necessary \u2013 potentially zero for the penny.\n\n\u201cUnlike a lot of what the new administration [of President Trump] has been doing pursuant to the flood of executive orders since January 20, this action seems to me entirely lawful and fully constitutional,\u201d said Tribe.\n\nRobert Triest, an economist professor at Northeastern University, says \u201cthe process of discontinuing the penny in the US is a little unclear\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt would likely require an act of Congress, but the secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,\u201d Triest was quoted by Northeastern Global News as saying in a January news article. Phasing out the penny, he added, would raise questions about how to round cash transactions and the use of people\u2019s existing collections of pennies.",

    "body": "Hungary, whose government maintains support of Russian narratives about war in Ukraine, is accused of seeking defence data.\n\nUkraine and Hungary are expelling two diplomats each after both sides accused the other of engaging in espionage.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, writing on X on Friday, announced the action after Kyiv\u2019s SBU security agency said it had uncovered a spy network run by the Hungarian state to obtain intelligence about its defence.\n\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Budapest\u2019s expulsion order was in response to what he called Ukrainian \u201cpropaganda\u201d.\n\n\u201cTwo Hungarian diplomats must leave our country within 48 hours,\u201d Sybiha wrote on X. \u201cWe are acting in response to Hungary\u2019s actions, based on the principle of reciprocity and our national interests.\u201d\n\nRelations between Kyiv and Budapest have long been strained, but the antipathy has grown amid Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine\u2019s SBU said in a statement it had detained two suspected agents who, it said, were being run by Hungarian military intelligence.\n\nThe activities of the suspected spies were focused on the western Ukraine region of Zakarpattia, which borders Hungary and is home to a sizeable Hungarian ethnic minority. Budapest and Kyiv have clashed over the rights of Hungarians in Zakarpattia, most of which was part of Hungary until the end of World War I.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSybiha said in a statement that the spy network was tasked with collecting information about the military security of the region, search for vulnerabilities in the region\u2019s ground and air defences and \u201cstudy the sociopolitical views of local residents, in particular scenarios of their behaviour if Hungarian troops enter the region\u201d.\n\nThe SBU said the suspects \u2013 a 40-year-old man and a woman \u2013 were former members of Ukraine\u2019s military. They were placed in custody on Friday and given notice that they were under suspicion of committing state treason. They both now face up to life in prison, it added.\n\nIt was the first time in Ukraine\u2019s history that a Hungarian spy network had been found to be working against Kyiv\u2019s interests, the SBU said.\n\n\u2018Defamatory acts against Hungary\u2019\n\nHungary\u2019s Szijjarto did not directly deny the allegations of a Hungarian espionage cell operating in the neighbouring country, but stated that the SBU\u2019s claims could be classified as \u201canti-Hungarian propaganda\u201d launched by Kyiv in retaliation for Hungary\u2019s refusal to assist Ukraine in its fight against Russia.\n\n\u201cWe do not tolerate that Ukraine should continuously launch such defamatory acts against Hungary and the Hungarian people,\u201d Szijjarto said in a Facebook video on Friday.\n\n\u201cTherefore, today, we have expelled from Hungary two spies working under diplomatic cover at Ukraine\u2019s embassy in Budapest,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHours later, Sybiha announced that the two Hungarian diplomats would be expelled.\n\nHungary, a member of NATO and the European Union, has taken an adversarial approach to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion launched on February 24, 2022.\n\nThroughout the Ukraine war, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has delayed Western military aid to Kyiv and maintained warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, at odds with his European Union peers.\n\nOrban has used staunch nationalism to build his political base at home, in particular stressing grievances over the territories lost to neighbouring states \u2013 including Ukraine \u2013 under the Versailles Treaty that ended World War I.\n\nBudapest has berated Kyiv for years, claiming discriminatory actions against the 150,000 or so ethnic Hungarians, most of whom live in the Zakarpattia region.",

    "body": "With advances made via land, sea and air, Turkiye forges an independent path.\n\nTurkiye has always placed a premium on its defence, initially buying then developing its own weapons.\n\nThe owner of NATO\u2019s second-largest standing army has also emerged as a notable weapons exporter, with some iconic products on the international market.\n\nTurkiye\u2019s exports increased year on year to reach $7.1bn in 2024 \u2013 from $1.9bn a decade prior \u2013 with customers across Europe and the Middle East.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind this growth? What are Turkiye\u2019s capabilities? And why is it important? Here\u2019s what we know:\n\nWhen did Turkiye move to domestic production?\n\nTurkiye has sought military self-sufficiency for a while, a gradual process that saw it establish the Defence Industry Development and Support Administration Office (SAGEB) in 1985.\n\nFor years, SAGEB focused on international collaboration in research and development. But as Turkiye came up against restrictions on what weapons it could purchase and how it could use them, that switched to local production.\n\nIn the 2010s, it switched focus to domestic design, resulting in a huge increase in domestic defence production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, thousands of Turkish defence manufacturers span land, air, and naval capabilities, which is being increasingly recognised internationally.\n\nHave you heard about Turkish drones?\n\nPerhaps the most famous Turkish unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is the iconic Bayraktar TB2, first deployed in 2014, one of the most widely purchased Turkish defence products.\n\nThere are several others, however, including the medium-altitude long-endurance Anka-S, which has a payload of 200kg (441lb), and the Vestel Karayel tactical UAV with a 70kg (154lb) payload.\n\nThe country is also working on its \u201cSteel Dome\u201d (Celik Kubbe), described as a system that, augmented by AI, can identify and intercept any airborne threat.\n\nAdditionally, work is ongoing on the first domestic fifth-generation fighter, the Turkish KAAN, which aims to replace aging American F-16s in the Turkish Air Force.\n\nWhat else is in Turkiye\u2019s catalogue?\n\nOn the ground, Turkiye\u2019s armoured vehicle production is spearheaded by the Altay main battle tank, designed to rival Western models such as the German Leopard or the US Abrams.\n\nThe army also has a mine-resistant vehicle, the Kirpi (Hedgehog), widely used in counterinsurgency operations, as well as modern infantry fighting vehicles like the FNSS Defence Systems\u2019 Kaplan and the Pars.\n\nThere\u2019s also naval production, with MILGEM (Milli Gemi Projesi, or the National Ship Project), which was set up in 2004 to produce the next generation of Turkish naval class ships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMILGEM has produced state-of-the-art Ada-class corvettes and Istanbul-class frigates, with plans for more advanced warships and submarines.\n\nMost remarkable is the amphibious drone-carrying assault ship, the TCG Anadolu, the largest ship in the Turkish navy, which was deployed in 2023.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a long list of smart munitions, air defence systems, and missiles, such as the Bora short-range ballistic missile and the long-range Atmaca (Hawk) missiles.\n\nWhy the interest in arms manufacturing?\n\nTurkiye\u2019s push to develop military hardware can be said to be as much a result of outside forces as internal drivers.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the United States put an arms embargo on Turkiye over its military intervention in Cyprus.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Germany instituted an export ban on arms to Turkiye, saying armoured cars it sold to Turkiye had been used domestically when the contract had specified they could only be used against an attack by a non-NATO state.\n\nThen in 2020, the US sanctioned Turkiye over its purchase of the Russian S-400 air defence system, by which time Turkiye was already established as an arms manufacturer.\n\nToday, there are about 3,000 weapons companies in Turkiye.\n\nSo how much is Turkiye exporting?\n\nExports have increased so they now comprise 1.7 percent of global arms exports, putting the country in 11th place for the period from 2020 to 2024 in the ranking of the world\u2019s defence exporters, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to monitors, during the last year, Turkiye\u2019s exports reached 178 countries, marking a 103 percent increase compared with 2015-2019.\n\nIts main customers in the 202-2024 period were the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and Qatar, according to SIPRI.\n\nAs for its most famous export, the Bayraktar medium-altitude long-endurance drone has reportedly been exported to at least 31 countries, including Iraq, Ukraine, Kenya, Bangladesh and Japan.\n\nLast year, its manufacturer Baykar announced the investment of $300m in developing its own jet engines, aiming to take on more component production and avoid international supply chain challenges.\n\nIt aims to develop an in-house engine for its Akinci drone, then a turbofan engine for Kizilelma, an unmanned air-to-air combat vehicle that is under development. So far, both use Ukrainian engines.",

    "body": "Right-wing incumbent has four-year term to implement promises to clamp down on crime and improve economy.\n\nEcuador\u2019s right-wing President Daniel Noboa has been re-elected in a second-round election run-off.\n\nThe National Electoral Council declared late on Sunday that the incumbent, who has promised to boost the flagging economy and continue a crackdown on cartel violence, had won by a wide margin.\n\nWith more than 90 percent of ballots counted, the 37-year-old Noboa was reported to have taken 55.8 percent of the vote. That gave him a twelve-point lead over left-wing opponent Luisa Gonzalez.\n\nHowever, his rival, whose support polls had suggested was running close to the incumbent\u2019s, has demanded a recount, claiming the vote was fraudulent.\n\nNoboa, who was elected in snap elections in 2023, now has a full four-year mandate in which to continue his divisive \u201cmano dura\u201d (tough) crackdown on violence tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighbouring Colombia and Peru. The smuggling and associated criminality has blighted Ecuador since 2021.\n\n\u201cEcuadorians have spoken. From tomorrow morning, we will go to work,\u201d Noboa told supporters during a brief speech in his hometown of Olon. He also criticised his opponent\u2019s fraud allegations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGonzalez, who may have been penalised at the polls for her close ties to populist firebrand ex-President Rafael Correa, told chanting supporters that the result was \u201cthe worst and most grotesque electoral fraud in the history of Ecuador\u201d.\n\nThe results came as a surprise to many after the first round in February, in which Noboa finished just 16,746 votes ahead of Gonzalez.

    "title": "Can US House Republicans cut $880bn without slashing Medicaid?",
    "body": "The prospect of deep cuts to Medicaid, the United States government programme to provide healthcare to low-income people, has become a flashpoint in Congress as leaders of both parties accuse their counterparts of lying.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democratic Party leader in the House of Representatives, said on February 27 that a Republican budget measure would \u201cset in motion the largest cut to Medicaid in American history\u201d and Republicans are hiding the consequences.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans are lying to the American people about Medicaid,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cI can\u2019t say it any other way. Republicans are lying. Prove me wrong.\u201d\n\nRepublicans said Democrats were distorting the Republican budget. Congressman Steve Scalise said: \u201cThe word Medicaid is not even in this bill.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said on CNN that Republicans don\u2019t want to cut Medicaid \u201cand the Democrats have been lying about it.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are looking for massive budget savings to meet their goal of fully extending President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts. This is a separate process from Congress\u2019s need to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government running by Friday or else face a federal government shutdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what we know so far about potential Medicaid cuts.\n\nHouse Republican budget plan seeks $880bn in cuts\n\nMedicaid serves about one in five Americans. The healthcare programme is paid for by the federal government and partly by states. Louisiana, home to Johnson and Scalise, has one of the highest state proportions of Medicaid enrollees.\n\nThe House Republican budget plan adopted on February 25 opens the door to slashing Medicaid even though it doesn\u2019t name the programme.\n\nThe plan directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find ways to cut the deficit by at least $880bn over the next decade.\n\nThe committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid, Medicare and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in addition to much smaller programmes. CHIP offers low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nRepublicans ruled out cuts to Medicare, the health insurance programme for senior citizens, which leaders cut at their political peril. Medicare is about 15 percent of the federal budget, and Medicaid is about 8.6 percent.\n\nWhen Medicare is set aside, Medicaid accounts for 93 percent of the funding under the committee\u2019s jurisdiction, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found in a March 5 analysis. That means it is impossible for the committee to find enough cuts that don\u2019t affect Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy to imply that federal Medicaid assistance won\u2019t be cut very deeply,\u201d said Allison Orris, an expert on Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Medicaid, the next largest programme under the committee\u2019s jurisdiction is CHIP. Lawmakers don\u2019t appear to be planning to wipe out CHIP, but even if they did, they would be only a \u201cfraction of the way there\u201d, said Joan Alker, an expert on Medicaid and CHIP at Georgetown University in Washington, DC.\n\nIf Medicare cuts are off the table, the only way to achieve $880bn in savings is through big Medicaid cuts, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health policy organisation.\n\nAndy Schneider, a professor at Georgetown who served in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration as a senior adviser at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said even if the committee eliminated all other programmes entirely, it could achieve only $381bn in savings \u2013 about 43 percent of the target.\n\n\u201cIn short, if they don\u2019t want to cut Medicaid [or CHIP], and they don\u2019t want to cut Medicare, the goal of cutting $880bn is impossible,\u201d Schneider said.\n\nThe $880bn cut is not a done deal. House Republicans were able to pass their budget package, but Senate Republicans are taking a different approach and haven\u2019t proposed such significant cuts.\n\nAny finalised budget blueprint would need Senate Republicans\u2019 buy-in. Senator Josh Hawley is among Republicans who have spoken against potential cuts. He told the HuffPost: \u201cI would not do severe cuts to Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe numbers are starting points that may lead to negotiation among at least Republicans, Joe Antos, a healthcare expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said. \u201cWe are a long way from final legislation, so it\u2019s not possible to predict how much any programme will be cut,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf the bill also includes extending the [Trump 2017] tax cuts, we are probably months away from seeing real language,\u201d Antos said.\n\nOnce the House and Senate reach an agreement on language and the resolution passes both chambers, the committees would work on detailed cuts. To enact such cuts, both chambers would need to approve a separate bill and receive Trump\u2019s signature.\n\nWhy eliminating fraud doesn\u2019t solve the problem\n\nRepublican leaders have deflected concerns about Medicaid cuts by talking about a different target: Medicaid fraud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we\u2019re going to get fraud out of there,\u201d Trump said in an interview on the Fox News channel on Sunday in keeping with his campaign rhetoric that he would protect those programmes.\n\nAt the same time, Trump praised the House resolution that would make cuts highly likely: \u201cThe House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!\u201d he said in a social media post.\n\nWould eliminating fraud solve the Medicaid problem? No.\n\nOn CNN, Johnson said cutting fraud, waste and abuse would result in \u201cpart of the savings to accomplish this mission\u201d. He said the government loses $50bn a year in Medicaid payments \u201cjust in fraud alone\u201d.\n\nBut Johnson conflated \u201cfraud\u201d with \u201cimproper payments\u201d. The Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm that examines the use of public funds, found about $50bn in improper payments in Medicaid and the same amount in Medicare in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose improper payments were made in an incorrect amount (overpayment or underpayment), should not have been made at all, or had missing or insufficient documentation. But that doesn\u2019t mean there was $50bn in Medicaid fraud, which would involve obtaining something through wilful misrepresentation.\n\nThe system used to identify improper payments is not designed to measure fraud, so we don\u2019t know what percentage of improper payments were losses due to fraud, Schneider said.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s a drop in the overall bucket of the potential $880bn in cuts.",

World leaders are expected to attend the ceremony in advance of a conclave to elect the next head of the Catholic Church.\n\nAll cardinals currently in Rome were summoned to the meeting to outline the funeral arrangements and start preparations for the succession.\n\nThe funeral ceremony will take place in front of St Peter\u2019s Basilica, with the dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, leading the service. The pope\u2019s body will then be taken to the Basilica of St Mary Major in Rome and laid to rest.\n\nAs well as agreeing the timing of the funeral, the cardinals decreed that the body of the pontiff will be taken to St Peter\u2019s Basilica on Wednesday morning at 07:00 GMT for public viewing. Francis is currently laid out in a coffin in the chapel of the Santa Marta residence where he lived during his 12-year papacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Vatican said in a statement that Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, the camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, will preside over a prayer, after which the coffin will undertake a short itinerary that will culminate with entering the Basilica through its central door.\n\nThe camerlengo will then preside over a liturgy at the altar, at the end of which it will be possible for the public to begin paying their respects to Pope Francis\u2019s body.\n\nFrancis died aged 88 on Monday following a stroke and cardiac arrest, the Vatican said, bringing an end to a 12-year papacy defined by advocacy for the marginalised and at times clashes with traditionalist forces in the Church.\n\nHaving spent five weeks in hospital earlier this year with double pneumonia, the pope had returned to his modest Casa Santa Marta residence nearly a month ago and appeared to be on the mend. He had even addressed worshippers in St Peter\u2019s Square on Easter Sunday.\n\nHis passing has triggered time-honoured Vatican protocols, including the ceremonial destruction of the Fisherman\u2019s Ring and papal seal, which symbolises the end of his papal authority.\n\nWorld leaders and royals, including United States President Donald Trump and President Javier Milei of Argentina, the pontiff\u2019s native country, are preparing to attend the funeral ceremony.\n\nBreaking with tradition, Francis wished to be buried at the Basilica of Saint Mary Major, which is outside the Vatican and home to his favourite icon of the Virgin Mary, rather than at St Peter\u2019s Basilica.\n\nAs the announcements regarding the funeral and public viewing of the body were made, the Vatican also published photos and a video of Pope Francis in his open coffin, dressed in a red robe with the papal mitre on his head and a rosary in his hand.\n\nThe Church is now preparing for a conclave, expected to begin after May 6, where 135 cardinal electors, nearly 80 percent of whom were appointed by Francis, will vote in secret to choose his successor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith no clear favourite emerging, cardinals will use General Congregations in the coming days to reflect on the Church\u2019s future direction.",

    "title": "Trump-China tariff war: Who\u2019s winning so far?",
    "body": "It\u2019s early days, but the warning signs are flashing red for the US.\n\nAfter United States President Donald Trump suspended his \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on major US trading partners on April 9, he ramped them up on China\u2019s goods. US trade levies on most imports from China have climbed to 145 percent. Beijing retaliated with duties of its own, at 125 percent on US goods.\n\nTrump has long accused China of exploiting the US on trade, casting his tariffs as necessary to revive domestic manufacturing and reshore jobs back to the US. He also wants to use tariffs to finance tax cuts. Most economists remain sceptical Trump will achieve his aims.\n\nFor now, the US and China are locked in a high-stakes game of chicken. The world is waiting to see which country will yield and which will stay the course. As Trump nears his first 100 days in office for the second time, here\u2019s where the tariff war with China stands:\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with negotiations?\n\nTrump recently played up the possibility of securing a trade deal with China. Last week, the US president said his tariffs on China will \u201ccome down substantially\u201d in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a fair deal with China,\u201d Trump told reporters on April 23, stirring hopes of a de-escalation. He also said his administration was \u201cactively\u201d negotiating with the Chinese side without elaborating.\n\nOn April 24, however, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce rebuffed president Trump\u2019s remarks, saying there were no talks taking place between the two countries.\n\n\u201cAny claims about the progress of China-US economic and trade negotiations are groundless and have no factual basis,\u201d ministry spokesman He Yadong said.\n\nWhile he insisted that Beijing won\u2019t duck any economic blows from Washington, he also said the door was \u201cwide open\u201d for talks.\n\nLast week, the Reuters news agency reported that China was evaluating exemptions for select US imports \u2013 a list of up to 131 products.\n\nBeijing has not made any public statement on the issue.\n\nHas the tariff war impacted US exports?\n\nTrump introduced his sweeping tariffs on China less than three weeks ago. The fallout for US businesses won\u2019t be fully felt until later this year. Still, the warning signals are already flashing red.\n\nData from the US Department of Agriculture shows that exports of soya beans \u2013 the biggest US farm export \u2013 fell dramatically for the period April 11-17, the first full week of reporting since Trump\u2019s China tariff announcement.\n\nBy April 17, net sales of US soya beans dropped by 50 percent compared with the previous week. That was driven by a 67 percent fall in weekly soya bean exports to China, which, until recently, was America\u2019s biggest export destination for the legume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Piergiuseppe Fortunato, an adjunct professor of economics at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland, \u201cChina\u2019s retaliatory tariffs will hit US farmers hard. Some may go out of business.\u201d He added that all sectors with exposure to China would come under strain.\n\nIn 2023, the US exported roughly $15bn of oil, gas and coal to China. Losing that market would hit US energy firms.\n\nAre imports to the US going to take a hit?\n\nSince the start of Trump\u2019s tariff war, cargo shipments have plummeted. According to Linerlytica, a shipping data provider, Chinese freight bookings bound for the US fell by 30 to 60 percent in April.\n\nThe drastic reduction in shipping from America\u2019s third largest trading partner \u2013 after Canada and Mexico \u2013 has not yet been felt. In May, however, thousands of companies will need to restock their inventories.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg News, retail giants Walmart and Target told Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could roll out to Christmas.\n\nElectronic appliances, such as TV sets and washing machines, made up 46.4 percent of US imports from China in 2022. The US also imports a lot of its clothing and pharmaceutical product ingredients from China. The price of these goods will begin to rise from next month.\n\nOn April 22, the International Monetary Fund raised its US inflation forecast to 3 percent in 2025, owing to tariffs \u2013 a full 1 percentage point higher than in January. The lender also lowered its US economic growth forecast and raised its expectation that the US will tip into recession this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow will China\u2019s economy be affected?\n\nDespite growing tensions between the US and China, Washington and Beijing remain major trading partners.\n\nAccording to the Office of the US Trade Representative, the US imported $438.9bn in Chinese goods last year.\n\nThat amounts to roughly 3 percent of China\u2019s total economic output, which remains heavily reliant on exports.\n\nIn a report shared with its clients this month, Goldman Sachs said it expects Trump\u2019s tariffs to drag down China\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 2.4 percentage points.\n\nFor their part, China\u2019s top officials said the country can do without American farm and energy imports and promised to achieve a 5 percent GDP growth target for this year.\n\nZhao Chenxin, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that together with non-US imports, domestic farm and energy production would be enough to satisfy demand.\n\n\u201cEven if we do not purchase feed grains and oilseeds from the United States, it will not have much impact on our country\u2019s grain supply,\u201d Zhao said on Monday.\n\nHe also noted there would be limited impact on China\u2019s energy supplies if companies stopped importing US fossil fuels.\n\nIn some ways, experts said, China has been preparing for this crisis.\n\nFortunato told Al Jazeera: \u201cThe US is one of China\u2019s biggest export markets, so tariffs will slow GDP growth. But Beijing has played this smartly as it began diversifying its imports away from the US during the first Trump trade war\u201d in 2018.\n\nHe also pointed out that \u201cthe US depends on China for up to 60 percent of its critical mineral imports, used in everything from clean energy to military technology. The opposite flow simply isn\u2019t there, so the US is more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCould the US lose its geopolitical standing?\n\nTrump has made little secret of his wish to conscript US allies into a trade war. The administration said it aims to strike free trade deals with the European Union, Great Britain and Japan.\n\nMore generally, reports suggest that Washington is asking trade partners to loosen their economic ties with China as a pre-condition for securing relief from Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.\n\nNevertheless, US allies seem largely opposed to any economic showdown with China. Last week, the European Commission said it has no intention of \u201cdecoupling\u201d from China.\n\nElsewhere, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves recently told the Daily Telegraph newspaper: \u201cChina is the second biggest economy in the world, and it would be, I think, very foolish to not engage.\u201d\n\nMany countries are not in a position to abandon their trade ties with Beijing. The EU, in particular, has a huge trade deficit with China. Cutting off access to Chinese goods \u2013 both consumer products and inputs for industry \u2013 would bruise its already sluggish economy.\n\nAcross the developing world, China\u2019s trade role is equally as crucial. Roughly a quarter of Bangladesh\u2019s and Cambodia\u2019s imports come from China. Nigeria and Saudi Arabia are similarly dependent on Beijing for their goods imports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see why countries would want to undermine their own business interests to try and reduce America\u2019s trade deficit with China,\u201d Fortunato said. \u201cOn this point, I think Trump has been short-sighted and may be forced to blink first on lowering tariffs with China.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs Trump losing his grip on Republican voters?\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party doesn\u2019t need to worry about its next election cycle. Trump\u2019s Republican Party does, so Beijing has the political upper hand in Trump\u2019s trade war. Simply put, it has more time on its side.\n\nFor Trump\u2019s party, his sabre rattling already looks politically costly. A new Economist-YouGov poll shows Americans reporting Trump\u2019s economic actions have hurt them personally more than they\u2019ve helped by a 30-point margin.\n\nAnd public approval of the president\u2019s economic management has been low for a while: It had fallen to 37 percent in a Reuters-Ipsos poll published on March 31, his lowest score ever in that survey.\n\nIf Trump stays the course, it is likely that his approval ratings might fall still lower, jeopardising the Republican Party\u2019s fragile grip on the US House of Representatives \u2013 and possibly the Senate, experts said.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons\u201d, Fortunato said, \u201cChina does not feel compelled to rush to the negotiating table to secure a trade deal. That will probably fall to Trump.\u201d",

At the same time, Sanad also identified at least six homes razed in Tal as-Sultan, west of Rafah, a little more than 750 metres (820 yards) from the Egyptian border.\n\n\u201cThis is a war crime because they are destroying residential houses,\u201d Attar said, referring to the fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the destruction of private property.\n\nMeanwhile, Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said on Tuesday that Israeli attacks, unexploded ordnance, or fatal injuries sustained earlier have killed 118 people since the ceasefire agreement took effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to military breaches of the ceasefire, Israel has not allowed in sufficient amounts of essential humanitarian aid, such as food, fuel, tents, and emergency shelters.\n\nRafah Mayor Ahmed al-Sufi said most of the city\u2019s residents remain displaced, with an estimated 200,000 people sheltering in the al-Mawasi Khan Younis area and other locations across Gaza, unable to come home.\n\nAccording to him, initial estimates indicate that 90 percent of Rafah\u2019s homes have been damaged, with approximately 52,000 units suffering various degrees of destruction.",

    "body": "Trump\u2019s pronouncement on Gaza isn\u2019t the first time he has voiced his wholehearted support of Israel.\n\nThe return of US President Donald Trump has been hailed by parts of the Israeli public who see his second term as a return of uncritical support of Israel.\n\nTrump\u2019s predecessor, Joe Biden, supported Israel in its war on Gaza, as well as its invasion of Lebanon, but his administration\u2019s occasional misgivings about Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza, which is now thought to have killed close to 62,000 people, made parts of the Israeli public unhappy.\n\nTrump\u2019s involvement in a ceasefire that led to the release of some Israeli captives from Gaza and his enthusiastic suggestions of ethnically cleansing Gaza have raised Israeli hopes that his second term will be as pro-Israeli as his first.\n\nHere\u2019s how he has helped prop Israel up.\n\nDiplomacy\n\nTrump\u2019s diplomatic moves and appointments reflect his unwavering support for Israel.\n\nHe wants the US ambassador to Israel to be Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who opposes the two-state solution that would give Palestine a state and has even questioned whether \u201csuch a thing as a Palestinian exists\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s previous ambassador to Israel was the hardline, pro-settlement, David Friedman.\n\nTrump also nominated Elise Stefanik as US ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik says Israel has a \u201cbiblical right\u201d to the West Bank.\n\nIn 2017, Trump said all of Jerusalem was the capital of Israel, despite Palestinian plans to declare occupied East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.\n\nHe also moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nUnder Trump, the US cut all funding for the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA, in 2018.\n\nOne of the principles UNRWA was founded on was the Palestinian right to return to their homes they were ethnically cleansed from by Israel as it occupied Palestinian lands.\n\nIn November 2019, citing anti-Israel bias, the US was the only country to vote with Israel against all eight of the UN 4th committee resolutions aimed at supporting Palestinian rights, condemning Israeli settlements, upholding refugee protections, ensuring the supply of humanitarian aid, and reinforcing existing international law\n\nIn 2020, Trump pushed for the Abraham Accords, normalising relations between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco. This incentivised economic ties and security cooperation with Israel in return for US aid, or diplomatic support.\n\nSupport of Israeli territorial expansion\n\nIsrael\u2019s illegal settlements on Palestinian land and other moves to expand its territory were also staunchly supported by Trump.\n\nIn May 2019, Trump reversed decades of US policy and said the occupied Golan Heights were Israeli territory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in November 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo overruled his department\u2019s 1978 legal opinion that settlements were illegal, saying the \u201cestablishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not, per se, inconsistent with international law\u201d. International law is clear on the illegality.\n\nThe following year, Pompeo said the decision on whether to annex the Palestinian territory of the West Bank was an Israeli one.\n\nThe Trump administration was then silent on construction to expand the illegal settlement at Givat Hamatos near Jerusalem, which cut off parts of the city claimed by Palestinians.\n\nThe US was also silent when construction of new settlements at the flashpoint city of Hebron began in December 2019, and planners cited changed US policy as the reason to proceed.\n\nIn 2020, Trump presented the \u201cPeace to Prosperity Plan\u201d, ostensibly a peace plan.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan placed Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, dismissing Palestinian claims to occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nIt also envisioned Israel annexing large portions of the West Bank, legitimising many of the Israeli settlements deemed illegal under international law.\n\nWhat little of the Palestinian state that was allowed within the \u201cplan\u201d was fragmented, with limited sovereignty and subject to Israeli security control.\n\nThe proposals also required Palestinians to meet stringent conditions before statehood was conferred upon them, including disarming Hamas, recognising Israel as a Jewish state and renouncing resistance to Israeli occupation in return for economic investment but no sovereignty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plan was overwhelmingly rejected by Palestinians.\n\nAttacking international courts\n\nIn 2019, the ICC announced that there was a reasonable basis to investigate potential war crimes by Israel in the occupied West Bank, occupied East Jerusalem, and Gaza.\n\nThe Trump administration strongly opposed this, defending Israel and taking steps to undermine the court.\n\nThe following year, in the face of strident international opposition, it imposed sanctions on ICC officials, including Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, restricting their visas and freezing their assets.\n\nConfrontations with Israel\u2019s regional rivals\n\nDuring its first four years, the Trump administration was particularly focused on confronting many of Israel\u2019s regional rivals.\n\nEarly in its existence, the Trump administration pushed through increased sanctions on the Lebanese group Hezbollah, targeting its global financial network, and threatening sanctions and account closures against anyone who finances the group.\n\nHezbollah has confronted Israel on numerous occasions.\n\nIn 2018, following campaigning by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA), reimposing strict economic sanctions on Iran in a bid to economically cripple Israel\u2019s regional nemesis.\n\nIn April 2019, the US designated Iran\u2019s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a \u201cterror group\u201d, hoping to isolate it internationally and increase the costs on Iran \u201cfor its support of terrorist activity\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following year, the US went a step further, assassinating IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani, weakening Iran\u2019s regional influence and ability to hold military positions in other countries in the region, such as Iraq and Syria, from where Israel felt itself under threat.",

    "title": "Can Europe guarantee Ukraine\u2019s security without the US?",
    "body": "European nations are working on security guarantees for Ukraine against Russia with, Trump making clear that the US won\u2019t. But can they?\n\nHuddling in London over the weekend, European leaders declared that they would work to pull together a plan to end the war in Ukraine, but with security guarantees for the country that has been the victim of a full-scale Russian invasion since February 2022.\n\nThe meeting in the United Kingdom followed close on the heels of a disastrous visit to the White House by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which he was publicly berated by United States President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance for resisting their plans for an unconditional peace plan with Russia.\n\nTrump has made it clear that the US will not provide security guarantees for Ukraine, urging Europe\u2019s military forces to take charge instead.\n\nIn meetings with Trump in Washington, DC last week, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer both indicated a willingness to send troops to Ukraine as peacekeepers if a deal to end Russia\u2019s war is reached.\n\nBut can Europe meaningfully provide a security cover to Ukraine, without the US backing it? What are Europe\u2019s true security capabilities? How dependent is the region on US support? And what threat does Russia pose?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat role does the US play in European security?\n\nThe US has been central to European security since the end of World War II, when it helped create the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and deployed hundreds of thousands of soldiers to Europe to challenge Soviet influence. It has maintained this security leadership ever since, while also expanding its global superpower status.\n\nAs of July 2024, the US had about 65,000 active-duty soldiers permanently stationed across Europe, along with extensive weaponry, defence systems and other assets vital to NATO, according to the US government\u2019s Defense Manpower Data Center.\n\nThis includes six pre-positioned weapons stockpiles in Europe, equipped with tanks and armoured vehicles, eight air squadrons, four navy destroyers and an estimated 100 nuclear bombs. Additionally, the US has some 10,000 soldiers on rotational deployment in Poland \u2013 a key part of NATO\u2019s eastern flank with Russia.\n\nTo fund its military muscle, the US relies on a mammoth defence budget, which stood at $860bn in 2024. That is more than double that of all other combined members of NATO, who are bound to defend each other in the event of an attack.\n\nAt the same time, the US has provided the majority of direct military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded it in 2022, sending approximately $65bn, according to the US Department of State. When accounting for other types of assistance, the US had allocated approximately $183bn to the Ukraine response as of September 30, 2024, according to Ukraine Oversight, a website created by the US government to record aid sent to Ukraine. The European Union, for its part, has sent a total of $141bn in aid to Ukraine, including $51bn in military assistance, according to the European Commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Trump has said it is now time for the US to step back militarily from Europe and wants its allies in the continent to do more heavy lifting.\n\n\u201cStark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe,\u201d declared Trump\u2019s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at a meeting of NATO allies on February 12. \u201cEuropean allies must lead from the front.\u201d\n\nHow strong are NATO\u2019s European allies?\n\nNATO\u2019s European members have a combined two million active-duty soldiers, a small section of whom are assigned directly to serve under the alliance\u2019s command. Turkiye and Poland have the most soldiers, with 481,000 and 216,000 respectively, according to NATO\u2019s latest estimates.\n\nFrance and Germany follow, with 205,000 and 186,000 soldiers. The UK, which has offered to send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine under a potential peace deal, has 138,000 soldiers. NATO itself has a force of about 40,000 throughout its eastern flank \u2013 spanning Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nTogether, NATO\u2019s European allies have some 7,000 aircraft, 6,800 tanks, 2,170 military ships and six aircraft carriers, according to the Global Firepower defence index.\n\nHow would NATO fare if the US scales down?\n\nDespite its significant military assets, NATO still heavily depends on the US to deter threats in Europe. In the event of a major attack on one of their own, such as by Russia, NATO would likely expect the US to rush hundreds of thousands of additional troops to Europe, according to economic think tank Bruegel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Europe can no longer rely on this support, enhanced by Washington\u2019s advanced military technology and infrastructure, Bruegel estimates the continent would need to create 50 new brigades, each consisting of thousands of soldiers, to fill the gap.\n\nConcerned, European states are feeling the pressure to increase their defence spending.\n\nLast week, the UK announced it would increase defence spending to 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2027. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said this would add some $16bn every year to the defence budget, which currently stands at $68bn. \u201cThis government will begin the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War,\u201d Starmer told Parliament.\n\nGermany had announced a special fund of more than $100bn to upgrade and strengthen its military in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, adding to its annual defence budget of some $52bn. Last year, the country\u2019s defence budget hit 2 percent of GDP for the first time since the end of the Cold War as part of a NATO target set in 2014 following Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea. Germany\u2019s presumptive next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, in a December speech, stressed that the military would need \u201cat least $84bn a year\u201d in the future.\n\nFollowing Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, NATO allies across Europe and Canada increased their spending by an unprecedented 18 percent. Currently, 22 of 30 European NATO members spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defence, as per their 2023 pledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Trump has argued that is not nearly enough, calling for the states to boost defence spending to at least 5 percent of GDP.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has acknowledged Europe\u2019s need to invest more. \u201cWe have not paid enough over the last 40 years, particularly since the Berlin Wall came down,\u201d Rutte told Politico on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on February 15. \u201cThe US is rightly asking for a rebalancing of that. It\u2019s totally logical.\u201d\n\nHow does Russia view NATO?\n\nRussia has cited NATO\u2019s expansion as one of its justifications for invading Ukraine. Since its founding in 1949, NATO has grown from 12 to 32 members, steadily moving eastward towards Russia\u2019s borders. Currently, six NATO members \u2013 four of which joined since the turn of the millennium \u2013 border Russia, including Finland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.\n\nTo keep the Western military alliance at bay, Moscow has demanded that Ukraine, which has long sought NATO membership, be kept out of the grouping.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, this problem will continue to poison the atmosphere on the European continent,\u201d said Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on February 18. Trump\u2019s administration, pushing for a quick end to the war, has said NATO membership is not \u201crealistic\u201d for Ukraine.\n\nBut Western European states view Russia\u2019s aggression as a reason to strengthen the bloc. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia, the world\u2019s largest nuclear power, has invaded or occupied parts of several nearby countries \u2013 Moldova, Georgia, and most recently Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia\u2019s direct military intervention in Moldova in the early 1990s helped Russian-aligned separatists gain de facto control of the breakaway region of Transnistria. Russia\u2019s blistering invasion of Georgia in 2008 dealt a heavy blow to Tbilisi and complicated its ties with the West.\n\nSince the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, NATO has grown. Previously neutral Finland and Sweden have joined the alliance over the past two years.\n\nHow strong is Russia\u2019s military?\n\nCurrently, Russia has at least 1.32 million active-duty soldiers, hundreds of thousands of whom are fighting in Ukraine. Moscow had previously stationed about 12,000 soldiers in Kaliningrad, its westernmost enclave, sandwiched between NATO members Poland and Lithuania. However, most of these forces were reportedly redeployed to Ukraine earlier in the conflict.\n\nRussia also operates dozens of overseas military facilities, most located in former Soviet states. As of 2024, this includes at least two major bases in Belarus, two in Kazakhstan, two in Armenia, two in the disputed Georgian territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and one base each in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Moldova\u2019s breakaway region of Transnistria, according to the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies. The largest of these facilities is the 201st military base in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, which, as of 2022, had an estimated 7,000 Russian soldiers.\n\nIn terms of military assets, Russia has 4,292 aircraft, 5,750 tanks, 449 ships and one aircraft carrier, according to Global Firepower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this capacity does not match NATO\u2019s combined strength, it would present a tougher test if the US were to step back, as Trump has called for.\n\n\u201cEuropeans need to wake up,\u201d said EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas at a conference of the European Defence Agency on January 22. The continent\u2019s \u201cfailure to invest in military capabilities\u201d, she said, \u201csends a dangerous signal to the aggressor. Weakness invites them in.\u201d",

    "title": "Pope Francis, pontiff who pushed church boundaries \u2014 but didn\u2019t break them",
    "body": "The pope, who pushed for a less opaque Vatican and connected to common and marginalised people\u2019s concerns, died aged 88.\n\nPope Francis, the Argentinian pontiff who brought the plight of the world\u2019s most marginalised back to the centre of the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s attention, has died aged 88, the Vatican announced on Monday.\n\nA charismatic communicator with a friendly demeanour, Francis succeeded in broadening Catholicism\u2019s appeal at a time of growing disenchantment towards the Church, an institution embroiled in financial and sexual scandals.\n\nThroughout his papacy from 2013 to 2025, the pope stripped the Vatican of some layers of opacity and connected with the concerns of common people. He highlighted the plight of the poor and that of prisoners.\n\nFrancis condemned the Church\u2019s abuse of power while engaging with other faiths.\n\nFrancis\u2019s tone marked a radical departure from his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who believed that nurturing the Church\u2019s most ardent believers was the way to strengthen the institution.\n\nBut Francis\u2019s shift never translated into fundamental changes to the Church\u2019s doctrine on contentious issues. In most instances, he remained in line with previous papacies, staunchly opposing gay marriage, women becoming priests and priests marrying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, his steps to open up the Church drew the ire of traditionalists, while the lack of radical change under his watch drew criticism from progressives.\n\nReligious pluralism and inequality\n\nFrancis was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in 1936 in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, to immigrant parents who fled Italy\u2019s fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini.\n\nHe trained as a chemical technician, worked in the food processing industry, and, for a brief time, was a bouncer in a nightclub in Cordoba before becoming a priest in 1969.\n\nHe liked to dance tango, although he preferred milonga, Francis said in a 2010 interview, referring to the faster-paced music that preceded tango.\n\nHis upbringing in Buenos Aires exposed him to religious pluralism and socioeconomic inequalities \u2013 two factors that experts believe explain his commitment to interfaith dialogue and pointed criticism of capitalism and consumerism.\n\nAt just 36 years of age, he became the head of Argentina\u2019s Jesuits, a Roman Catholic order of priests.\n\nBack then, he was a stern disciplinarian, experts and biographers say. At the time, liberation theology, a left-wing interpretation of the Gospel that centred on concern for the poor and oppressed groups, was popular among Jesuits in Latin America, but Francis did not subscribe to the ideology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirty War\n\nFrancis\u2019s tenure then coincided with the years of Argentina\u2019s Dirty War, which lasted from 1976 to 1983 \u2013 seven years of brutal military dictatorship.\n\nTens of thousands of people were tortured, killed and disappeared. The role of Argentina\u2019s Church in those years remains contentious, with Francis never openly denouncing the regime.\n\nAs archbishop of Buenos Aires, a position he assumed in 1998, he said he was not aware of the scale of what was happening in the late 1970s \u2013 a position refuted by critics and associates who argue that there was no way he could not have known at the time.\n\n\u201cLet us pray \u2026 for the complicit silence of most of society and of the Church,\u201d he said during a ceremony in 1999, a quote some read as an admission of complacency.\n\nDuring his time as archbishop, he would become an outspoken critic of social injustice and economic inequality.\n\n\u201cThe Church can\u2019t just sit sucking its finger when faced with a frivolous, cold and calculating market economy,\u201d he once said during a sermon.\n\nBreaking with tradition\n\nIn 2013, the Catholic world was shocked when the then-Pope Benedict XVI resigned, breaking a centuries-old tradition of holding papal duties until death.\n\nFrancis, who by then had been elected cardinal, rushed to the Vatican to vote for a new pope.\n\nIn what was a tight race, Francis, who had already been a runner-up in the previous papal conclave in 2005, was elected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith him, the Church chose its first non-European pontiff in 1,282 years \u2013 the last one was Gregory III, elected in 731 from Syria \u2013 and also its first leader since then from the Global South, which today is home to the majority of Christians worldwide.\n\nFrancis set the tone of his papacy immediately. When he stood on the large balcony and faced the huge crowd in Saint Peter\u2019s Square after being elected, he broke with the tradition of blessing the crowd, asking people instead to pray for him.\n\nHe refused to move to the grand papal apartment on the top floor of the Vatican palace, opting to stay in the more modest Domus Sanctae Marthae residence. He preferred to be driven around in a Fiat rather than a Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\u201cBe shepherds with the smell of sheep,\u201d he told a crowd of priests in 2013, urging a departure from the pomp and splendour often associated with the clergy\u2019s top hierarchy.\n\nOn his first trip outside Rome as pope, he travelled to Lampedusa, an Italian island and key point of entry for migrants and refugees trying to reach Europe. He threw a crown of flowers into the sea to commemorate the people who died in the Mediterranean Sea while risking their lives to come to Europe.\n\nFrancis criticised then-US President Donald Trump\u2019s plan in 2017 to build a wall along the Mexican border and his speeches targeting Muslims.\n\n\u201cIn Pope Francis, the message that \u2018everybody is brothers and sisters\u2019 is very strong, along with insisting that God pushes for religious pluralism,\u201d said Marco Politi, a Vatican expert and author of the book Pope Francis Among the Wolves: The Inside Story of a Revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch pluralism translated into a more inclusive approach towards other religions, Politi said, putting an end to the \u201cculture war of previous papacies\u201d.\n\nFrom the Vatican to the Arabian Peninsula\n\nTies between the Church and Muslims around the world had soured when Francis\u2019s predecessor, Benedict XVI, made a speech in September 2006 that was perceived as linking Islam to violence.\n\nFrancis became the first pontiff ever to travel to the Arabian Peninsula. In February 2019, he landed in the United Arab Emirates, where he met Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand imam of Cairo\u2019s Al-Azhar Mosque.\n\nTogether, they signed a document rejecting religious fundamentalism, exhorting people to see in the other a \u201cbrother to support and love\u201d. The pope had also met el-Tayeb previously, in 2016, at the Vatican.\n\nIn another first, Francis, in 2015, published the encyclical Laudato si\u2019 (Praise be to you), in which he urged the world to address the threat of climate change while also stressing the need to rethink the economic balance between the industrialised and developing worlds.\n\nResponse to sexual abuse in the Church\n\nThe issue of sexual abuses perpetrated by Church officials dominated the tenure of Benedict XVI, whose papacy saw a wave of scandals.\n\nFrancis began addressing the issue of abuse in 2019 by abolishing the rule of \u201cpontifical secrecy\u201d on cases related to sexual violence.\n\nThis meant that testimonies collected in the canonical process were finally made available to legal authorities.\n\nThat same year, after the pope himself admitted to having dismissed valid claims of sexual abuse in Chile, he introduced a law outlining clear rules for reporting child sexual abuse committed by Church officials and attempts to cover it up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour years later, that rule was updated and strengthened to widen the category of victims to vulnerable adults, while laypeople working for the Church could also now face punishment. But victims\u2019 advocates and critics say Francis did not go far enough to ensure justice.\n\n\u2018Who am I to judge?\u2019\n\nFrancis drastically changed the tone of the Church towards homosexuality, ending the Vatican\u2019s long demonisation of gay people.\n\n\u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d he famously said in 2013, his words a stark contrast to those of Pope John Paul II, who more than 10 years earlier called a gay rights march in Rome \u201can offence to Christian values\u201d.\n\nMore recently, on his way back from a trip to South Sudan, Francis said being gay was not a crime.\n\nHe expressed support for same-sex civil unions. In 2023, he hinted that he was open to reviewing the practice of celibacy.\n\nIn December 2023, the Vatican, in a landmark ruling, decided that Catholic priests would be able to administer blessings to same-sex couples, provided these were not given in the context of civil unions or weddings or Church liturgies.\n\nAt the same time, the pontiff remained opposed to gay marriage and abortion, and while he included women in the Vatican\u2019s government, he always ruled out their becoming priests.\n\nThroughout his papacy, Francis often found himself under attack from both conservative and progressive camps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose following the traditional doctrine saw him as too much of a reformer and a socialist, while those seeking deeper changes within the Church did not consider him bold enough.\n\nPoliti, the Vatican expert, argues that Francis\u2019s decision not to make changes that were too radical stemmed from an understanding that this would have torn apart an already much-divided Church. Instead, he says, Francis opted \u201cto trigger processes of transformation in its mentality through gestures and words\u201d.",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated he is open to the prospect of direct talks with Kyiv, but his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, says that will happen only after a ceasefire.\n\nPutin told Russian state TV on Monday that he had a \u201cpositive attitude towards any peace initiatives\u201d and he hoped Kyiv would \u201cfeel the same way\u201d. However, his spokesman stressed on Tuesday that there are currently no concrete plans for talks between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy countered this later at a briefing on Tuesday, a day before key talks in London seeking a potential settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war. \u201cAfter the ceasefire, we are ready to sit down in any format,\u201d he said.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have held no bilateral talks since the immediate aftermath of Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of its neighbour. However, the United States has been raising the pressure on them to agree to a ceasefire.\n\nPutin\u2019s comments, which a spokesman said on Monday meant that he was open to direct talks, followed the expiration of a Russian-declared, 30-hour Easter truce, which each side accused the other of violating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZelenskyy did not respond directly to Putin\u2019s comments, but he signalled in a nightly video address that Ukraine was \u201cready for any conversation\u201d about a ceasefire that would stop attacks on civilians.\n\nNow, after Easter, the whole world can clearly see the real issue \u2014 the real reason why the hostilities continue.

At the same time, the US leader continued on Monday to express hope that a deal is close and could even be reached this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to be seeking to backpedal on Tuesday as he clarified that no bilateral talks are currently planned and told reporters that, while Russia is ready to consider Zelenskyy\u2019s proposal, the issue is complex.\n\n\u201cThe president explained the complexity of this topic. \u2026 If we talk about civilian infrastructure facilities, we need to clearly differentiate in what situations these facilities can be a military target and in what situations they cannot,\u201d he said.\n\nPeskov added that if Ukraine wanted to talk, then it should take steps to \u201clegally clear the obstacles to such contacts\u201d, an apparent reference to a 2022 Zelenskyy decree barring negotiations with Putin, which he issued after Russia declared the annexation of four Ukrainian regions that its forces partly control.\n\nUkraine and its European allies have told Washington it should not be fooled into believing Russian claims that it is ready to discuss a ceasefire, insisting that Moscow is using delaying tactics.\n\nNegotiators from the US, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and France are due to meet in London on Wednesday for another round of talks on ending the war, Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe discussions are a follow-up to a similar meeting in Paris last week.\n\nAt that meeting, Europe expressed its red lines over Ukraine to the US, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Tuesday.\n\nHe also suggested in an interview with France Info radio that the Easter truce had been a marketing operation designed by Putin and aimed at defusing Trump\u2019s growing impatience over Russia\u2019s failure to agree to a ceasefire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian state media, meanwhile, quoted Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov as saying US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow this week on what would be his fourth trip since Trump took office on January 20.\n\nAmid the push for an end to the fighting, in which Trump appears ready to accept many of Moscow\u2019s demands and gains, Russia is eager to press home its military advantage on the battlefield.\n\nUkraine\u2019s air force reported another overnight barrage of missiles and drones on Tuesday, saying Russia launched 54 drones.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian media said the military had retaken the Gornal St Nicholas Belogorsky Monastery, one of the last positions held by Ukrainian troops in Russia\u2019s Kursk region.",

    "body": "One person is reportedly injured from jumping off a balcony during the 6.2 magnitude quake.\n\nA strong earthquake has hit Turkiye, causing buildings in the city of Istanbul to shake.\n\nThe quake, taking place at 12:49 [09:49 GMT] on Wednesday in the Marmara Sea off the coast of Istanbul\u2019s Silvri area, registered a preliminary 6.2 magnitude, reports Turkiye\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Authority (AFAD).\n\nIt was at a depth of 10km (6.21 miles), according to the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ).\n\nThe quake was felt in several neighbouring provinces and in the city of Izmir, some 550 kilometres (340 miles) south of Istanbul. The initial quake was followed by eight others with magnitudes of 3.5 to 5.9.\n\nAs buildings shook in the city located on the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus strait, people rushed onto the streets where crowds of worried-looking people stared at their mobile phones for information or made calls, an AFP correspondent said.\n\n\u201cI just felt earthquake, I\u2019ve got to get out,\u201d said a shaken-looking decorator rushing out of a fourth floor apartment where he was working near the city\u2019s Galata Tower, who did not want to give his name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurkey\u2019s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya told national TV network HaberTurk that authorities had not received reports of collapsed buildings, but that there had been reports of damage to buildings. Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu said initial inspections did not reveal any damage or adverse conditions on highways, airports, trains or subways.\n\nBroadcaster TGRT reported that one person had been injured as a result of jumping off a balcony during the quake, which occurred during a public holiday in Turkiye, forcing authorities in Istanbul to cancel scheduled events.\n\nKemal Cebi, the mayor of Kucukcekmece district in western Istanbul, told local broadcaster NTV that there were \u201cno negative developments yet\u201d, but said that there were traffic jams and that many buildings were already at risk due to the density of the area.\n\nIn a post on X, Yerlikaya said emergency authorities have begun \u201cfield assessments\u201d and offered well wishes to those affected.\n\nAFAD warned people in the region against entering damaged buildings.\n\nThe tremors could be felt as far away as Bulgaria, according to the AFP news agency in the capital Sofia.\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan said on X he was monitoring the situation and his office issued advice on what people should do in the case of further quakes.\n\nPrevious deadly quake\n\nTurkey is crossed by two significant fault lines, and earthquakes are frequent.\n\nThe last tremor to be felt in Istanbul was in mid-November, when a quake caused brief panic but no damage or injuries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA magnitude 7.8 earthquake on February 6, 2023, and a second powerful tremor that came hours later, destroyed or damaged hundreds of thousands of buildings in 11 southern and southeastern Turkish provinces, leaving more than 53,000 people dead.\n\nAnother 6,000 people were killed in the northern parts of neighbouring Syria.\n\nWhile Istanbul was not impacted by that earthquake, the devastation heightened fears of a similar quake with experts citing the city\u2019s proximity to fault lines.\n\nIn a bid to prevent damage from any future quake, both the national government and local administrations started urban reconstruction projects to fortify buildings at risk and started campaigns of demolishing buildings at risk of collapse.",

    "title": "Have scientists discovered a new colour called \u2018olo\u2019?",
    "body": "Described as a \u2018deeply saturated teal\u2019 colour, humans can only see it with the help of laser technology.\n\nA team of scientists claims to have discovered a new colour that humans cannot see without the help of technology.\n\nThe researchers based in the United States said they were able to \u201cexperience\u201d the colour, which they named \u201colo\u201d, by firing laser pulses into their eyes using a device named after the Wizard of Oz.\n\nOlo cannot be seen with the naked eye, but the five people who have seen it describe it as being similar to teal.\n\nWhat has the study found?\n\nProfessors from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Washington School of Medicine published an article in the journal, Science Advances, on April 18 in which they put forth their discovery of a hue beyond the gamut of human vision.\n\nThey explained that they had devised a technique called Oz, which can \u201ctrick\u201d the human eye into seeing olo. The technique is named after the Wizard of Oz.\n\nIn the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in 1900, Frank Baum wrote about a man who uses tricks to fool the residents of the fictional land of Oz into thinking he\u2019s a wizard. For instance, it is believed that the Emerald City, the capital of Oz, is so bright and vibrant that visitors have to wear special glasses to protect their eyes. The glasses are one of the wizard\u2019s tricks, since they make the city appear greener and grander.\n\nHow do humans perceive colour?\n\nThe human eye perceives colour via three types of photoreceptor or \u201ccone cells\u201d in the retina. S cones pick up shorter, blue wavelengths of light; M cones detect medium, green wavelengths; and L cones detect longer, red wavelengths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe signals from these cones are then sent through a complex series of cells in the retina that act to clean up and integrate the signal before passing it down the optic nerve through parts of the brain,\u201d Francis Windram, a research associate at the department of life sciences at Imperial College London, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe part of the brain that the visual information is passed to is the visual cortex.\n\nHow did scientists find the \u2018new\u2019 colour?\n\nIn normal vision, the function of M cones overlaps with the neighbouring S and L cones, so any light that stimulates M cones also activates the other two cones. The M cones don\u2019t function alone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no wavelength in the world that can stimulate only the M cone,\u201d Ren Ng, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley, explained in an article published on its website.\n\n\u201cI began wondering what it would look like if you could just stimulate all the M cone cells. Would it be like the greenest green you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d\n\nSo Ng teamed up with Austin Roorda, one of the creators of the Oz technology and a professor of optometry and vision science at UC Berkeley.\n\nOz, which Roorda described as \u201ca microscope for looking at the retina\u201d, uses tiny microdoses of laser light to target individual photoreceptors in the eye. The equipment, which must be highly stabilised during use, is already being used to study eye disease.\n\nThe work using Oz began in 2018 by James Carl Fong, a doctoral student in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. Hannah Doyle, another doctoral student at Berkeley, ran the experiments through which human subjects were able to see the new colour, olo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs olo really a new colour?\n\nThe shade of olo has always existed, it just falls beyond the spectrum of shades visible to the human eye. There are other such shades that we cannot see. Hence, olo is not a new colour that has come into existence, from a physical or scientific perspective.\n\nHowever, \u201cfrom a sociolinguistic perspective, if people give new names to colours which previously were indistinguishable thanks to this technology, then maybe! It all depends on how you say it,\u201d Windram said.\n\nHow many people have seen olo?\n\nFive people have seen the \u201cnew\u201d colour \u2013 four men and one woman. All had normal colour vision.\n\nThree of the subjects, including Roorda and Ng, are the co-authors of the research paper while the other two are members of the participating lab at the University of Washington and were unaware of the purpose of the study before they took part.\n\nWhat does olo look like?\n\nThose who have seen olo describe it as a teal or green-blue colour \u2013 but one they had never seen before.\n\nIn the article by UC Berkeley, it is described as a \u201cblue-green colour of unparalleled saturation\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was like a profoundly saturated teal \u2026 the most saturated natural colour was just pale by comparison,\u201d Roorda said.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a subject for this paper, but I\u2019ve seen olo since, and it\u2019s very striking. You know you\u2019re looking at something very blue-green,\u201d Doyle said.\n\nThe researchers said an image of a teal square is the closest colour match to olo. However, this square is not an olo-coloured square. The naked human eye simply cannot see the shade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you start with the colour in that picture, and imagine dialling up the saturation further you would get to the teal of real peacock feathers, further still would be a laser in the teal wavelength, and far beyond that is olo, outside the natural space of human colors,\u201d Ng told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to see olo on any smartphone displays or any TVs any time soon. And this is very, very far beyond VR headset technology,\u201d Ng said, according to a report in the UK\u2019s Guardian newspaper.\n\nCould this technology help people with colour blindness?\n\nBerkeley researchers are exploring whether the Oz technology could help people with colour blindness.\n\n\u201cWe are now studying the science of boosting the colour dimensionality of signals going from the eye to the brain,\u201d Ng said. \u201cIf it proves possible for a colour blind person to see full colour, the next question is whether a person with full colour could be boosted to yet a higher dimension of colour called tetrachromacy.\u201d\n\nThis could contain colours beyond the rainbow that would need new names. Ng said that this is part of an ongoing scientific inquiry.\n\nWindram said success would depend on the cause of colourblindness in individuals. Deuteranomaly, which causes decreased sensitivity to green light, is the most common form of colour blindness.\n\n\u201cIn this case, a miniaturised version of this technology could theoretically be used to correct this by directly stimulating the cones when the correct colour of light hits them,\u201d Windram said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWindram pointed out that publicity materials for the research show images of the Oz experiment on a highly stabilised table.\n\n\u201cThis would require a lot of work to miniaturise the technology, and is likely a long way off. Given that the laser must stably hit the correct cones in order to stimulate them, this may not really be feasible as a form of vision correction technologically,\u201d he said.\n\nHow do we know how people \u2018see\u2019 colour?\n\nThe concept of a colour has three main components, Windram explained: The physical, which has to do with the wavelengths of light that meet the eye; the neurological, which refers to how humans biologically process these light signals; and the societal or linguistic component, which pertains to how colours are named.\n\n\u201cIn the end I may see a colour and call it \u2018red\u2019, someone else may call it \u2018rot\u2019 or \u2018rouge\u2019 \u2026 but also another may look at it a bit more closely and say \u2018well it\u2019s claret\u2019 or \u2018crimson\u2019.\u201d\n\nTo test this, neuroscience and AI researcher Patrick Mineault developed a website for entertainment purposes in September 2024, on which users can take a test to see how their colour perception compares to others.\n\nHumans can also perceive colour differently due to differences in factors such as \u201ctemperature\u201d of light. This was demonstrated when a photo of a dress went viral in 2015, dividing social media users over whether the dress was white and gold, or blue and black.\n\nWindram explained that people who were deciding what colours the dress was were drawing on preconceived notions of whether the photograph of the dress was taken in warm lighting or cool lighting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo animals see colour differently from humans?\n\nYes, different species can experience colours differently.\n\nFor example, humans process three wavelengths corresponding to red, blue and green light, while the mantis shrimp, a tiny crustacean, can visually perceive 12 channels of colour instead of three. An article by the Australian Academy of Science explains that the mantis shrimp can also detect ultraviolet and polarised light, which humans cannot see.\n\nHowever, while the human eye can mix two colours and perceive an in-between shade \u2013 such as purple as a mix of red and blue \u2013 the mantis shrimp\u2019s eyes cannot mix colour receptors.\n\nMeanwhile, dogs only have two types of cones and can mostly only see shades of yellow and blue.",

The Storyteller (1987) deals with the clash of Indigenous and European cultures in Peru, while Death in the Andes (1993) recounts the haunting and bloody years of the Shining Path hardline movement.\n\n\u201cAn author\u2019s work is fed by his own experience and, over the years, becomes richer,\u201d Vargas Llosa told the Reuters news agency in an interview in Madrid in 2001.\n\nThe Nobel Committee said in 2010 it was awarding him \u201cfor his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual\u2019s resistance, revolt, and defeat\u201d.\n\nPaying tribute to his colleague, fellow Peruvian writer Alfredo Bryce Echenique hailed Vargas Llosa\u2019s \u201cenormity\u201d. He told Peruvian radio RPP his friend\u2019s death was \u201ca sorrow for Peru\u201d.\n\nIn a post on X, Peru\u2019s President Dina Boluarte called him the \u201cmost illustrious Peruvian of all time\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis intellectual genius and vast body of work will remain an everlasting legacy for future generations,\u201d she added.\n\nVargas Llosa\u2019s works were also translated into some 30 languages.\n\nUS Deputy State Secretary State Christopher Landau said, \u201cTo label him as just Peruvian would be a disservice because his themes and interests were timeless and universal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will live on in my bookshelves and many others in Latin America and around the world,\u201d Landau wrote on X.\n\nPolitical forays and denouncing Castro\n\nBesides authoring books, Vargas Llosa was also outspoken on political issues.\n\nAlthough an early supporter of the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro, he later grew disillusioned and denounced Castro\u2019s Cuba. By 1980, he said he no longer believed in socialism as a solution for developing nations.\n\nIn 1990, Vargas Llosa ran for president of Peru, saying he wanted to save his country from economic chaos and a Marxist armed rebellion.\n\nHe, however, lost in the run-off to Alberto Fujimori, a then-unknown agronomist and university professor who defeated the armed rebels but was later jailed for human rights crimes and corruption.\n\nFrustrated by his loss, the writer moved to Spain but remained influential in Latin America, harshly criticising a new wave of strident left-wing leaders led by then-Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.\n\n\u201cIn reality, I never had a political career,\u201d Vargas Llosa once said.\n\n\u201cI took part in politics under very special circumstances \u2026 and I always said that whether I won or lost the elections, I was going back to my literary, intellectual job, not politics.\u201d",

    "title": "Bitter truth: Why has chocolate become so expensive?",
    "body": "Cocoa prices surged almost 300 percent last year, making chocolate bars, Easter eggs and cocoa powder much more expensive this year than last.\n\nIn the United States, retail chocolate prices were one-fifth higher this Valentine\u2019s Day compared with last year, according to Wells Fargo Bank. The price of a king-size US-sold Reese\u2019s Hearts chocolate bar was 13 percent higher in February 2024 than in the same month the year before.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, meanwhile, a Twix white chocolate Easter egg rose in price from 5 to 6 pounds ($6.63 to $7.96) at Tesco supermarkets in the run-up to Easter (year-on-year) and was reduced in size from 316g (11oz) to 258g (9oz). In all, the unit price rose by a whopping 47 percent.\n\nWhile the price of cocoa \u2013 the key ingredient in chocolate made from roasted raw cacao beans \u2013 has fallen back by about 20 percent since its all-time high in December 2024, consumers are still paying record prices for chocolate.\n\nThe spike in the price of cocoa can be chalked up to several factors. Chief among them is extreme weather, which has hit cocoa producers in West Africa, from where most of the world imports cocoa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Amber Sawyer, an analyst at the environmental think tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), expensive chocolate should not come as a surprise.\n\n\u201cChocolate is just one of the many foods being made more expensive by climate change-driven extreme weather,\u201d she said. \u201cThese extremes will keep getting worse.\u201d\n\nAnd so might the prices.\n\nWhat has happened to the price of cocoa?\n\nBenchmark New York futures contracts, used to exchange cocoa at a specified future date and price, hit a high of $12,565 per metric tonne in December 2024.\n\nLast year\u2019s meagre cocoa harvest led to record supply shortfalls, as poor weather and disease devastated crops in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, where two-thirds of the world\u2019s cocoa beans are grown.\n\nCrop shortages were also observed in Nigeria and Indonesia, the third- and fourth-largest cocoa producers.\n\nIn all, there was a 500,000-tonne deficit of cocoa in global markets in 2024, which is continuing to keep prices high.\n\nThe latest cocoa harvest \u2013 which ran from October 2024 to March 2025 \u2013 did get off to a bright start, with 33 percent more beans arriving at Ivory Coast ports compared with last year, Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said in a note to clients.\n\nBut while the New York cocoa futures price is currently hovering at about $8,350 per tonne \u2013 a significant drop from December \u2013 concerns are growing that the same dry weather that wrecked last year\u2019s crop will take a similarly devastating toll this year, Fritsch said.\n\nThe uncertainty is taking a toll on chocolate producers. Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut slashed its annual sales forecasts on April 11 due to what it called \u201cunprecedented volatility\u201d in cocoa prices, sending its shares falling almost 20 percent \u2013 its biggest ever one-day drop.\n\nWhat is causing the rise in prices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeather\n\nVolatile weather is one major factor. West Africa experienced extreme rainfall in 2023, with total precipitation more than double the 30-year average in some places, while 2024 saw extreme heat and drought.\n\nMany climate scientists point to the El Nino weather phenomenon, which produces warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, as the primary driver for volatile weather patterns. However, they also expect a transition to the La Nina pattern \u2013 the cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific every three to five years \u2013 to revive cocoa yields at least temporarily.\n\nIndeed, the International Cocoa Organization in February forecast a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 megatonnes for 2024-25, the first surplus in four years. That partly explains the recent fall in price.\n\nBut according to Felipe Pohlmann Gonzaga, a Switzerland-based commodity trader, the larger picture of \u201cclimate change is only going to make supply concerns worse\u201d in the longer term.\n\nScientists at the research group Climate Central published a paper this year showing that climate change compromised cacao trees during the harvest season in Ivory Coast and Ghana.\n\nLaws against deforestation\n\nBesides changing weather patterns, several other issues are also driving recent price hikes in cocoa.\n\nAcross West Africa, new deforestation laws have prevented farmers from expanding cocoa plantations, keeping a lid on supply.\n\nWest Africa is also grappling with an ageing tree stock. \u201cOlder trees are not being replaced,\u201d Pohlmann Gonzaga told Al Jazeera. \u201cThere has been under-investment in the industry.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisease\n\nAt the same time, the spread of the cocoa swollen shoot virus (CSSV) has hit harvests. Tropical Research Services, a market research group, recently found that Ivory Coast cocoa production could halve due to the spread of CSSV.\n\nIllegal gold mining\n\nMeanwhile, Ghanaian cocoa farmers are abandoning beans for gold in an illegal mining boom that has hit Ghana\u2019s cocoa production and helped drive up prices.\n\nIn recent months, investors have been buying up the precious metal to shield themselves from the financial market turmoil unleashed by United States President Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs. On April 16, gold reached $3,357 per ounce for the first time.\n\nAs a result, many farmers are selling their holdings to illegal miners who have decimated swaths of land in pursuit of gold. Ghana is Africa\u2019s leading producer of gold \u2013 and the sixth-largest globally.\n\nWill cocoa prices continue to rise?\n\n\u201cTariffs have had an impact on the value of commodities, and cocoa is no exception,\u201d says Pohlmann Gonzaga. \u201cAt first, you\u2019d think trade levies would reduce demand for cocoa in the US, which is a big consumer.\u201d The US consumes the most chocolate in the world, though the Swiss take that tag for the most per-capita consumption.\n\n\u201cBut if US consumption persists, that could raise prices. And of course, Trump may drop tariffs [on West African cocoa exporters] in the future, which would probably lead to higher demand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPohlmann Gonzaga cited the growing demand for chocolate in East Asia. \u201cWe may be seeing a similar trend as with coffee,\u201d he said. China\u2019s coffee consumption, for instance, increased by more than 60 percent between 2019 and 2024.\n\nIn the near term, Pohlmann Gonzaga said prices are likely to \u201ctrend sideways \u2026 as these factors can cancel each other out. Volatility will be the word of order for this year\u201d.\n\nHow have chocolate manufacturers responded?\n\nSo far, producers have responded in one of two ways \u2013 by passing the higher cost to consumers, or by promoting products with less cocoa or with substitute ingredients.\n\nLast year, food giant Nestle introduced a hazelnut flavour to its British Aero line of chocolate bars, which, at 36g (1.3oz), are about one-third the weight of competing chocolate bars.\n\nIn 2024, agri-food giant Cargill partnered with US chocolate alternatives producer Voyage Foods \u2013 which creates cocoa-free bars from grape seeds, sunflower flour and other flavourings \u2013 to be its business-to-business distributor.\n\nIn addition to big companies, startups like Nukoko and Planet A are exploring microbial fermentation techniques to enhance and mimic the aromas and flavours of chocolate.\n\nElsewhere, Dubai chocolate was founded in 2022. Its products are filled with pistachio and tahini and are inspired by kunafa, the chessy, saccharine dessert that is a staple across the Middle East and North Africa. Since coming to market, it has become a social media sensation.\n\nIf cocoa prices continue rising, \u201cI\u2019d expect to see more and more cocoa substitutes on supermarket shelves. The interesting question is whether consumer tastes will change\u201d, said Pohlmann Gonzaga.",

    "body": "Thousands of Israelis have gathered outside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv, urging the government to prioritise the release of captives still held in Gaza instead of escalating military operations in the Palestinian territory.\n\nThe demonstration on Saturday was held as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government authorised the mobilisation of up to 60,000 reserve troops, signalling plans to intensify its assault on the besieged Palestinian enclave.\n\nOne protester held aloft a placard castigating Netanyahu that read, \u201cour tyrant is a liar, because of him the state is on fire\u201d.\n\nGovernment officials claim an expanded military offensive on Gaza will pressure Hamas into releasing the 59 remaining captives, but critics argue it further endangers their lives. Ending the fleeting ceasefire, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives earlier this year, has not led to any more releases.\n\nA video circulated by Hamas on Saturday purported to show one of the Israeli captives, whom local media identified as Maxim Herkin. In the four-minute video posted online, Herkin is seen being rescued by Hamas members after an Israeli attack struck a tunnel, burying and injuring the Israeli captive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamilies of the captives released a statement saying they spent the Sabbath gripped by \u201cexcruciating anxiety\u201d after news of the government\u2019s planned escalation and the effect it could have on those still held in Gaza.\n\nThe Bring Them Home Campaign, a group representing the relatives, condemned the move as reckless.\n\n\u201cIsrael is on its way to sinking into the Gaza mud in the name of the illusion that it is possible to achieve any victory without returning our brothers and sisters from captivity,\u201d the group said in a post on X. \u201cExpanding the fighting will endanger the kidnapped, the living and the dead alike.\u201d\n\nThey urged Netanyahu to abandon the offensive and instead reach an agreement that would secure the captives\u2019 return. \u201cStop this mistake,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u2018Protests not enough to influence Netanyahu\u2019\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Israeli journalist Gideon Levy said the protest movement remains consistent, but lacks the momentum to challenge Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s the same old protest, very courageous and devoted, but not big enough to influence Netanyahu,\u201d Levy said.\n\nHe noted that a large segment of Israeli society continues to support the war effort, even amid rising frustration from the captives\u2019 families, and that \u201cwhen [Israelis] are called to war, they will obey.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu, speaking Thursday at a public event in Jerusalem, seemed to suggest that defeating Hamas remains Israel\u2019s top priority instead of the release of captives. \u201cWe want to bring all our hostages home,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war has a supreme goal, and the supreme goal is victory over our enemies, and this we will achieve.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaptives\u2019 families have accused Netanyahu of undermining previous attempts to reach a truce and swap deal.

    "body": "Europe has the industrial and financial might to help Ukraine without the US, says distinguished historian, Phillips O\u2019Brien.\n\nUkraine is at the most difficult point in its existential war since the full-scale Russian invasion began in February, 2022.\n\nThe United States has backed out of the alliance supporting Kyiv, reneging on a multiyear strategic agreement it signed with Ukraine last year.\n\nUkraine has been in a defensive posture for a year, and Russian attacks on Ukrainian soil are increasing.\n\nNow, the US is forcing Ukraine to negotiate for peace from a position of weakness, while demanding payback for $135.7bn in military and financial aid.\n\nWorse could yet come, warns Phillips O\u2019Brien, head of the School of International Relations at St Andrews University and a leading analyst and commentator on Ukraine. The US could drop its sanctions against Russia and back out of NATO.\n\nAl Jazeera spoke with him about why, despite these gloomy prospects, he believes Europe still has the capacity to keep Ukraine fighting, and could ultimately do much more to determine the outcome of this war \u2013 for the sake of its own security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAl Jazeera: Can Europe, plus a few other nations like Japan and Australia, save Ukraine from a bad deal with US President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin?\n\nPhillips O\u2019Brien: They can certainly keep Ukraine in the fight. A lot of it depends on what the US does. We have to be careful about that. If the US actually moves to fully backing Russia and provides Russia with a significant amount of intelligence and support, that will be really a problem for Ukraine and Europe.\n\nBut assuming, say, the US just pulls out and washes its hands of it, Europe has the resources to keep Ukraine going. It would require mobilisation, effort, a significant amount of commitment on Europe\u2019s part. So far, they\u2019ve not, I think, shown the united will to do that, but they certainly could do it if they wanted to. They have the money. They have the technological know-how. They even have the military equipment to make a significant difference.\n\nAl Jazeera: So you believe that \u2013 intelligence aside \u2013 Europe and Ukraine can quite quickly develop the defence industrial base needed?\n\nO\u2019Brien: Ukraine\u2019s already developing a lot of it, so what [Europeans] could do is help supercharge what the Ukrainians are doing in, say, UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] production. The Russian military is not this unstoppable machine. I think we have to realise it is still a deeply flawed institution.\n\nIt\u2019s been protected by the US in many ways throughout this war in the way that the US has aided Ukraine not to attack the Russian military machine in Russia, and that\u2019s been a conscious choice of the US. Europe could actually change, if it wanted to, the way it helped Ukraine to free up Ukraine, to provide it more aid to attack Russian production or Russian military facilities in Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he aims to make 30,000 long-range drones this year and 3,000 cruise missiles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat would be very impressive if they could get that money up and running, and that would, I think, put Russian logistics and military production under significant pressure.\n\nAl Jazeera: What would be the potential consequences of crossing the United States and Russia if Ukraine and Europe really banded together and did all these things, given what you said before about the US not necessarily remaining a neutral party?\n\nO\u2019Brien: If these tariffs [Trump announced on April 2] come into effect, it\u2019s already going to be an economic war with Europe. One of the things it could fully do \u2013 I think in many ways it\u2019s already done it de facto \u2013 is to say, \u2018The US will have no role defending Europe under NATO Article 5\u2019.\n\nThey could basically cut Europe off of the transatlantic alliance. I think the most dangerous thing for Europe in the immediate term is to end the nuclear guarantees, basically saying to Russia, \u2018We\u2019re not protecting Europe,\u2019 which means Europe\u2019s nuclear guarantee goes completely down to a very small number of French and British submarines.\n\nAl Jazeera: But Putin has already made nuclear threats. He did it when he dropped the Oreshnik ballistic missile on Dnipro last November \u2026\n\nO\u2019Brien: I don\u2019t think anyone in Europe took [previous threats] seriously as a threat against Europe because of the US nuclear shield.\n\nAl Jazeera: Is there a European deficit in intelligence capabilities?\n\nO\u2019Brien: Basically, much of European intelligence has been integrated with the US, and they had been provided a lot of information from the US, and the US has technological capabilities that they don\u2019t have.\n\nSo right away, you\u2019d have to rely on less good, less developed systems.\n\n[Starlink] is just part of it. [There\u2019s] US eyes in the sky, US listening, US intelligence sharing \u2013 they do have the kind of surveillance that Europe does not have at this point. It will leave you far worse off immediately, and Europe will have to build up a new system in its place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAl Jazeera: Would you, in this scenario of confrontation, expect pushback from within the United States or US forces in Europe?\n\nO\u2019Brien: Congress could try and force back at any time. The issue is the president\u2019s commander-in-chief, and right now, the Republicans have no desire to stand up to him.\n\nAl Jazeera: Why is it important for Europe to make that stand?\n\nO\u2019Brien: Because with the US out of the game, Ukraine becomes incredibly important to the future of European security.\n\nIf you take the US out, the state of Ukraine is absolutely, without a doubt, central to European security, because Ukraine is the difference, as Putin understands, between Russia being a threat to the continent or not.\n\nIf they can take Ukraine and rebuild in possession of Ukraine\u2019s resources, one assumes subsuming Belarus as well, then they\u2019re in a much better position. Who knows what happens with the populists in France or with the populists in other European countries. It\u2019s a very, very dangerous situation.\n\nEurope is torn between those that want action and those who still can\u2019t believe what they\u2019re looking at. It\u2019s deeply frustrating because you [could see] a year ago that [a Trump presidency] was coming down the pike. There was a significant chance Europe had to plan on the US going home, the US walking back from NATO, and they just didn\u2019t want to do it. There was a wilful inability to plan for a likely event, and that is a failure of leadership of historic proportions.",

throughout this war in the way that the us has aided ukraine not to attack the russian military machine in russia and that\u2019s been a conscious choice of the us europe could actually change if it wanted to the way it helped ukraine to free up ukraine to provide it more aid to attack russian production or russian military facilities in russia ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy says he aims to make 30000 longrange drones this year and 3000 cruise missiles advertisement that would be very impressive if they could get that money up and running and that would i think put russian logistics and military production under significant pressure al jazeera what would be the potential consequences of crossing the united states and russia if ukraine and europe really banded together and did all these things given what you said before about the us not necessarily remaining a neutral party o\u2019brien if these tariffs trump announced on april 2 come into effect it\u2019s already going to be an economic war with europe one of the things it could fully do \u2013 i think in many ways it\u2019s already done it de facto \u2013 is to say \u2018the us will have no role defending europe under nato article 5\u2019 they could basically cut europe off of the transatlantic alliance i think the most dangerous thing for europe in the immediate term is to end the nuclear guarantees basically saying to russia \u2018we\u2019re not protecting europe\u2019 which means europe\u2019s nuclear guarantee goes completely down to a very small number of french and british submarines al jazeera but putin has already made nuclear threats he did it when he dropped the oreshnik ballistic missile on dnipro last november \u2026 o\u2019brien i don\u2019t think anyone in europe took previous threats seriously as a threat against europe because of the us nuclear shield al jazeera is there a european deficit in intelligence capabilities o\u2019brien basically much of european intelligence has been integrated with the us and they had been provided a lot of information from the us and the us has technological capabilities that they don\u2019t have so right away you\u2019d have to rely on less good less developed systems starlink is just part of it there\u2019s us eyes in the sky us listening us intelligence sharing \u2013 they do have the kind of surveillance that europe does not have at this point it will leave you far worse off immediately and europe will have to build up a new system in its place advertisement al jazeera would you in this scenario of confrontation expect pushback from within the united states or us forces in europe o\u2019brien congress could try and force back at any time the issue is the president\u2019s commanderinchief and right now the republicans have no desire to stand up to him al jazeera why is it important for europe to make that stand o\u2019brien because with the us out of the game ukraine becomes incredibly important to the future of european security if you take the us out the state of ukraine is absolutely without a doubt central to european security because ukraine is the difference as putin understands between russia being a threat to the continent or not if they can take ukraine and rebuild in possession of ukraine\u2019s resources one assumes subsuming belarus as well then they\u2019re in a much better position who knows what happens with the populists in france or with the populists in other european countries it\u2019s a very very dangerous situation europe is torn between those that want action and those who still can\u2019t believe what they\u2019re looking at it\u2019s deeply frustrating because you could see a year ago that a trump presidency was coming down the pike there was a significant chance europe had to plan on the us going home the us walking back from nato and they just didn\u2019t want to do it there was a wilful inability to plan for a likely event and that is a failure of leadership of historic proportions",
    "summary": "Ukraine is at the most difficult point in its existential war since the full-scale Russian invasion began in February, 2022.\nThe Russian military is not this unstoppable machine.\nIt\u2019s been protected by the US in many ways throughout this war in the way that the US has aided Ukraine not to attack the Russian military machine in Russia, and that\u2019s been a conscious choice of the US.\nEurope could actually change, if it wanted to, the way it helped Ukraine to free up Ukraine, to provide it more aid to attack Russian production or Russian military facilities in Russia.\nAdvertisementThat would be very impressive if they could get that money up and running, and that would, I think, put Russian logistics and military production under significant pressure.",

    "body": "Authorities are still working to find out what caused one of Europe\u2019s worst blackouts.\n\nSpain and Portugal have regained access to electricity after one of Europe\u2019s worst blackouts paralysed transport systems, disrupted mobile communications and postponed medical procedures.\n\nFor almost a day from Monday to early on Tuesday, tens of millions of people were plunged into darkness. In major cities like Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon, people were trapped in lifts, stuck on trains and unable to access the internet.\n\nMeanwhile, queues snaked outside the few supermarkets running on backup generators as people stocked up on dried goods, water and battery-powered flashlights.\n\nThe Spanish and Portuguese governments quickly convened emergency meetings after the outage, which hit Spain and Portugal about 12:30 (10:30 GMT) on Monday and also briefly affected southern France.\n\nAlmost no one in the Iberian Peninsula, which has a population of almost 60 million people, escaped the blackout. Madrid was forced to declare a state of emergency.\n\nAlthough power has been largely restored, transport remains in dire straits, with trains and flights reporting delays. No firm cause for the shutdown has yet emerged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the power back on, attention is turning to what caused such a widespread failure of the region\u2019s networks.\n\nWhat caused the power outage?\n\nPortugal\u2019s electricity provider, Redes Energeticas Nacionais (REN), said a \u201crare atmospheric phenomenon\u201d had caused a severe imbalance in temperatures that led to the widespread shutdowns.\n\nREN said: \u201cDue to extreme temperature variations in the interior of Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 kV), a phenomenon known as \u2018induced atmospheric vibration\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Portuguese prime minister, Luis Montenegro, also said the issue originated in Spain.\n\nHowever, in a statement on Tuesday, Spain\u2019s national meteorological office, Aemet, appeared to rule out the weather as a culprit.\n\n\u201cDuring the day of 28 April, no unusual meteorological or atmospheric phenomena were detected, and nor were there sudden variations in the temperature in our network of meteorological stations,\u201d Aemet said.\n\nThe Spanish government said the cause of the power cut is still unknown and warned against speculation.\n\n\u201cMy gut feeling is that multiple factors were behind the blackout,\u201d Kang Li, smart energy systems chairman at the University of Leeds, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIt usually takes several months for forensic grid data to be properly analysed,\u201d he added, \u201cthough an interim report could be done in several weeks.\u201d\n\nBloomberg News reported that Spain has seen a record number of hours with negative power prices in recent months as more wind and solar energy supplies the grid. Until now, however, oversupply hadn\u2019t led to blackouts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2024, renewable energy sources accounted for 56 percent of all electricity used in Spain, a record high. By 2030, that proportion is expected to reach 81 percent.\n\nAccording to Li, \u201cit\u2019s harder to manage energy output when infrastructure is changing so quickly. A higher penetration of renewables with existing systems creates more fluctuation in the operating system.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said, \u201cWe have never had a complete collapse of the system,\u201d explaining how Spain\u2019s power grid lost 15 gigawatts, the equivalent of 60 percent of its national demand, in just five seconds.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no evidence yet of a cyberattack, Sanchez said he isn\u2019t ruling anything out. He warned against speculation but said \u201cno cause can be discredited at this point\u201d.\n\nCould a cyberattack have caused the blackout?\n\nAlthough investigations into the cause of the outage are ongoing, Portugal\u2019s National Cybersecurity Centre threw cold water on the idea of foul play, saying there was no sign that the outage resulted from a cyberattack.\n\nPortuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro also said there was \u201cno indication\u201d of a cyberattack.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Brussels, Teresa Ribera, an executive vice president of the European Commission, also ruled out sabotage. Nonetheless, the outage \u201cis one of the most serious episodes recorded in Europe in recent times\u201d, she said.\n\nFor now, the Spanish government said it is waiting for more information on the cause of the blackout. State officials said they hope in the coming days to know what the cause was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich countries were affected?\n\nSpain and Portugal were the worst affected, but outages occurred elsewhere too:\n\nSpain: Urban centres such as Avila, Madrid, Murcia, Galicia, Alicante, Zaragoza, Barcelona and Seville reported widespread disruptions. The Canary and Balearic islands were not affected.\n\nPortugal: Lisbon and Porto experienced comparable challenges.\n\nSouthern France: Parts of the French Basque Country saw brief power outages. But officials from the French electricity transmission network said the interruptions lasted only a few minutes.\n\nMorocco: Some reports suggested internet providers in Morocco struggled briefly to keep their services running because of network connections with France and the outages there.\n\nGreenland: Remote regions of Greenland lost access to key satellite services, including internet and telephones. Authorities said they own satellite equipment in Spain although a direct cause has not yet been established.\n\nHas power been restored?\n\nBy mid-afternoon on Monday, Spain\u2019s electricity operator, Red Electrica (REE), said it had started to recover voltage in the north, south and west of the country.\n\nThe recovery process was carried out gradually to avoid overloading the grid as generators linked up. Power also returned to Portugal bit by bit. By Monday night, REN said 85 of its 89 power substations were back online.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, power had almost fully returned to Spain and Portugal.\n\nAt 6:30am (04:30 GMT) more than 99 percent of energy demand in Spain had been restored, REE said. Elsewhere, power was restored overnight to 6.2 million of Portugal\u2019s 6.5 million households.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the city level, Madrid\u2019s metro system said service was restored on all but one line by 8am (06:00 GMT), meaning that 80 percent of trains were operating during Tuesday morning\u2019s rush hour.\n\nHas Europe suffered from blackouts of this scale before?\n\nWhile outages are not unheard of in Europe, the scale of Iberia\u2019s power failure was one of the largest in recent history.\n\nIn 2019, England and Wales suffered regional blackouts amid lightning strikes at a gas-fired power plant in Bedfordshire and an offshore wind farm off the east coast of England.\n\nA 2006 German power overload caused outages as far away as Portugal and Morocco. In 2003, a problem with a hydroelectric power line between Italy and Switzerland caused an outage across Italy for about 12 hours.\n\n\u201cInterconnection between countries has positive benefits as it can improve efficiency and reduce costs. \u2026 It\u2019s always sunny or raining somewhere in Europe,\u201d Li said.\n\n\u201cBut\u201d, he added \u201cinterconnected systems mean that local faults in one location can have domino effects elsewhere. Transmission lines can become overloaded.\u201d\n\nLi also pointed out that climate change and rising temperatures pose \u201cincreasing risks\u201d for Spain-and-Portugal-style blackouts.\n\n\u201cHeat, excessive rain and wildfires all increase the risk of transmission failures. We can address this by investing more in clean energy generation to increase energy system flexibility.\u201d",

    "body": "Bin strike end in touching distance, says union\n\n23 April 2025 Share Save Phil Mackie BBC News Midlands correspondent. Rob Mayor Political Reporter, Birmingham Share Save\n\nPA Media Uncollected rubbish has piled up in Birmingham during the dispute\n\nThe Unite union has agreed to attend mediation talks with conciliation service Acas next week to try to settle the ongoing bin strike in Birmingham. A deal could now be \"in touching distance\", the union said, but it accused the city council of \"saying one thing in public and another in the negotiations\". The all-out strike by Unite members over plans to downgrade some refuse workers, who could lose thousands of pounds a year each, started on 11 March. Talks with the council broke up after 45 minutes on Wednesday, the union said, while a spokesperson for the local authority stated negotiations were ongoing and \"positive\".\n\nAfter accusing the council of saying different things in public and talks, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said this \"flip flopping needs to be sorted prior to the Acas negotiations next week\". The dispute initially centred on the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles however Unite has increasingly also urged the council to guarantee the long-term pay for bin lorry drivers. While union bosses said a resolution could be in sight on the WRCO role row, they said an agreement seemed further off around drivers' pay. Unite accused the authority of failing \"to confirm whether it intends to cut the pay of hundreds of bin drivers by up to \u00a38,000\" and Ms Graham said \"threats of savage pay cuts\" had to stop. \"Unite has put forward workable proposals,\" she said. \"The ball is now in the council's court.\"\n\nPA Media A major incident was declared last month amid public health concerns\n\nA Birmingham City Council spokesperson said on Wednesday there had been an agreement to hold further discussions at the end of next week \"under the auspices of Acas\". The talks have been scheduled for 1 and 2 May. The strike, now in its seventh week, led to a major incident being declared last month amid concerns for public health and the environment. Waste has been piling up in the city since hundreds of bin workers started all-out strike action as a result the dispute over pay and jobs. On Tuesday, Jim McMahon, housing, communities and local government minister, said at least 26,000 tonnes of rubbish had been removed from Birmingham's streets and \"regular bin collections have resumed\" amid the disruption. However recycling and garden waste collections, which were suspended at the beginning of the year, remain affected.\n\nMembers of Unite began staging one-day walkouts in January after being told some workers would be downgraded and have their pay cut. The action escalated on 11 March, when more than 300 workers began an all-out strike, but several hundred continued working. Wagons were stopped from carrying out their rounds and only about 10% of Birmingham's regular daily bin collections were being completed.\n\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

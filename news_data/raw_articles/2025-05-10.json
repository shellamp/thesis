    "title": "Vladimir Putin rejects ceasefire ultimatum proposed by European leaders",
    "body": "Vladimir Putin has rejected an ultimatum by European leaders to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine or face increased sanctions, but has proposed holding direct negotiations with Kyiv this week.\n\nThe leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland told the Russian president either to sign up to an unconditional ceasefire by Monday or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cAll of us here, together with the US, are calling Putin out. If he\u2019s serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it now,\u201d said UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, at a joint press conference of the five leaders in Kyiv.\n\nStarmer said the leaders were demanding \u201can unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Putin\u2019s conditions, and [are] clear that if he turns his back on peace, we will respond, working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions, and increase our military aid for Ukraine\u2019s defence to pressure Russia back to the table.\u201d\n\n0:53 European leaders call for unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine \u2013 video\n\nStarmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz arrived in the Ukrainian capital on the same train on Saturday morning, while Donald Tusk travelled on a separate train. The leaders met Zelenskyy for talks in central Kyiv. It is Macron\u2019s first visit to Kyiv since summer 2022, and the first visit for Merz as chancellor, having only taken office this week.\n\n\u201cAll five leaders had a fruitful call with @POTUS focused on peace efforts,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, wrote on X, adding a picture of the five men gathered around a mobile phone on speaker mode.\n\nSybiha added: \u201cUkraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on Monday. If Russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured, a durable ceasefire and confidence-building measures can pave the way to peace negotiations.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s response to the ultimatum came in a press briefing for Russian media and western television networks, held in the Kremlin close to 2am local time on Sunday morning. Putin rejected the calls for a ceasefire, but said he was ready for direct negotiations with Ukraine.\n\nHe suggested delegations from the two countries could meet in Istanbul this Thursday to begin talks. \u201cWe don\u2019t exclude that during these negotiations we will be able to agree on new ceasefires,\u201d Putin said.\n\nMacron said on Sunday that Putin\u2019s talks proposal was \u201ca first step, but not enough\u201d. \u201cAn unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations,\u201d the French president said, adding that the Russian leader was \u201clooking for a way out, but he still wants to buy time\u201d.\n\nUkraine and European capitals have previously demanded a full ceasefire as a precondition to starting negotiations. Putin left the briefing, for which journalists had been kept waiting for up to seven hours, without answering any questions.\n\nThere was no immediate readout from the White House on the call, or on whether Trump had made specific commitments if Putin rejects the ceasefire.\n\nTrump and the US administration have said a 30-day ceasefire could be the first step on the way to a sustainable peace deal. Ukraine has said it is ready to implement such a ceasefire, but Russia has so far refused, saying it would only do so if all western weapons deliveries to Ukraine were halted.\n\nView image in fullscreen Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer in Kyiv, Ukraine. Photograph: Thomas Peter/Reuters\n\nIn an early sign that Russia may not be receptive to the latest ultimatum, the hawkish former president, Dmitry Medvedev, wrote on X: \u201cMacron, Merz, Starmer, and Tusk were supposed to discuss peace in Kyiv. Instead, they are blurting out threats against Russia \u2026 You think that\u2019s smart, eh? Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses.\u201d\n\nInstead, Moscow unilaterally declared a three-day ceasefire beginning on 8 May, which Kyiv said was designed to avoid Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia during celebrations of 80 years of the Soviet victory in the second world war, held in Moscow on Friday.\n\nThousands of troops marched through Red Square for the annual Victory Day parade, with numerous world leaders in attendance, most notably China\u2019s Xi Jinping, and the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Robert Fico and Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, the prime minister of EU member Slovakia and the president of EU hopeful Serbia, respectively, also attended the parade, drawing irritation from other European leaders.\n\nFighting has continued along the frontlines during the supposed ceasefire, both sides have said, but Russia has largely refrained from drone and missile attacks on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cPutin didn\u2019t need conditions when he wanted a ceasefire to have a parade, and he doesn\u2019t need them now. Ukraine has shown the willingness to engage again and again, but again and again Putin has refused,\u201d said Starmer.\n\nStarmer said Putin had drawn the wrong lessons from the second world war. \u201cWe understand the lessons of history, the lesson that any veteran of Normandy or north Africa or of any other campaign will tell you, but that Putin has not yet grasped. There is no glory in aggression and conquest, glory comes from fighting for your country, defending the people, and winning the peace,\u201d he said.\n\nView image in fullscreen L-R: Friedrich Merz, Emmanuel Macron, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Olena Zelenska, Keir Starmer and Donald Tusk in Maidan Square. Photograph: WPA/Getty Images\n\nMacron also referenced VE Day, and said that \u201cthe defence of the principles on which our continent and, more generally, the international order is based\u201d was at stake in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe four European leaders visited Kyiv\u2019s Maidan on Saturday morning with Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena Zelenska. Thousands of flags have been erected in the central square to remember those killed in the war with Russia. The leaders paid their respects and had a moment of silence, before heading to the talks with Zelenskyy. The five then had a virtual meeting with other leaders on progress being made for a so-called \u201cair, land, maritime and regeneration force\u201d that is planned to be part of a peace deal.\n\nTrump has yet to comment publicly on his conversation with the group of leaders. On Friday, he was asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he had a message for Putin. \u201cI have a message for both parties: get this war ended,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cGet this stupid war finished. That\u2019s my message for both of them.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has so far appeared to be much tougher on Kyiv than Moscow, but there are some small signals that the mood in Washington might be changing, after a positive meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Vatican on the sidelines of the pope\u2019s funeral.\n\nEven the vice-president, JD Vance, seen as the most sceptical of voices on support for Ukraine, has criticised Moscow\u2019s stance in recent days. \u201cRight now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they\u2019re asking for too much,\u201d he said this week.\n\nThe US embassy in Kyiv put out a public warning late on Friday night that it had received intelligence of a \u201cpotentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days\u201d. It did not give further details, but it later emerged that Russia will close its airspace over the Kapustin Yar missile testing range on Monday and Tuesday, which could indicate the potential launch of ballistic missiles.",

    "body": "The interim government in Bangladesh has banned all activities of the former ruling Awami League party headed by former influential prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted last year in a mass uprising.\n\nAsif Nazrul, the country\u2019s law affairs adviser, said on Saturday the interim cabinet headed by the Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus decided to ban the party\u2019s activities online and elsewhere under the country\u2019s Anti-Terrorism Act. The ban would stay in place until a special tribunal completes a trial of the party and its leaders over the deaths of hundreds of students and other protesters during an anti-government uprising in July and August last year.\n\n\u201cThis decision is aimed at ensuring national security and sovereignty, protection of activists of the July movement, and plaintiffs and witnesses involved in the tribunal proceedings,\u201d Nazrul told reporters after a special cabinet meeting.\n\nNazrul said the meeting on Saturday also expanded scope for trying any political parties involving charges of killing during the anti-Hasina protest being handled by the international crimes tribunal.\n\nHe said a government notification regarding the ban would be published soon with details.\n\nHasina and many of her senior party colleagues have been accused of murder in many cases after her ouster last year. She has been in exile in India since 5 August as her official residence was stormed by protesters soon after she left the country.\n\nThe UNs human rights office said in a report in February that up to 1,400 people may have been killed during three weeks of anti-Hasina protest.\n\nSaturday night\u2019s dramatic decision came after thousands of protesters, including supporters of a newly formed political party by students, took to the streets in Dhaka and issued an ultimatum to ban the Awami League party by Saturday night. The members of the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party also prominently took part in the protest.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Hasina or her party, but the chief of the Jatiya Nagorik or National Citizen party, Nahid Islam, who is also a student leader, applauded the Yunus-led government for its decision.\n\nThe student-led uprising ended Hasina\u2019s 15 years of rule, and three days after her fall Yunus took office as interim leader.",

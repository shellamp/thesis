    "body": "\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The nation\u2019s top public health agency says about 180 employees who were laid off two weeks ago can come back to work.\n\nEmails went out Tuesday to some Centers for Disease Control and Prevention probationary employees who got termination notices last month, according to current and former CDC employees.\n\nA message seen by the AP was sent with the subject line, \u201cRead this e-mail immediately.\u201d It said that \u201cafter further review and consideration,\u201d a Feb. 15 termination notice has been rescinded and the employee was cleared to return to work on Wednesday. \u201cYou should return to duty under your previous work schedule,\u201d it said. \u201cWe apologize for any disruption that this may have caused.\u201d\n\nAbout 180 people received reinstatement emails, according to two federal health officials who were briefed on the tally but were not authorized to discuss it and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many of the reinstated employees returned to work Wednesday. And it\u2019s also unclear whether the employees would be spared from widespread job cuts that are expected soon across government agencies.\n\nA sign marks the entrance to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, on Oct. 8, 2013.

(AP Photo/David Goldman, File) Share Share Facebook\n\nCopy Link copied\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nBluesky\n\nFlipboard\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit Read More\n\nThe CDC is the latest federal agency trying to coax back workers soon after they were dismissed as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s and billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s cost-cutting purge. Similar reversals have been made among employees responsible for medical device oversight, food safety, bird flu response, nuclear weapons and national parks.\n\nThe Atlanta-based CDC is charged with protecting Americans from outbreaks and other public health threats. Before the job cuts, the agency had about 13,000 employees.\n\nLast month, Trump administration officials told the CDC that nearly 1,300 of the agency\u2019s probationary employees would be let go. That tally quickly changed, as the number who actually got termination notices turned out to be 700 to 750.\n\nWith 180 more people now being told they can return, the actual number of CDC employees terminated so far would seem to stand somewhere around 550. But federal health officials haven\u2019t confirmed any specifics.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last month pledged \u201c radical transparency \u201d at the department, but HHS officials have not provided detail about CDC staff changes and did not respond to emailed requests on Tuesday and Wednesday. An agency spokesman, Andrew Nixon, previously told the AP only that CDC had more full-time employees after the job cuts than it did before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThose who received reinstatement emails included outbreak responders in two fellowship programs \u2014 a two-year training that prepares recent graduates to enter the public health workforce through field experience and a laboratory program that brings in doctorate-holding professionals.\n\nU.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock celebrated the reinstatements, but said it\u2019s not enough.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a welcome relief, but until all fired CDC employees are restored, our country\u2019s public health and national security will continue to be at risk,\u201d Warnock, a Georgia Democrat, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nContacting The Associated Press The Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual, nonpartisan journalism.

Protesters have so many things to push back against \u2014 from tariffs to Trump\u2019s reset on the war in Ukraine to the aggressive and sometimes legally dubious actions of the Department of Government Efficiency and its leader, billionaire Elon Musk, that it\u2019s hard to know what to focus on.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things to fight, but I hope by being here we are starting some conversations,\u201d said Sara Grummer-Strawn, who held a sign declaring \u201cSo Much Wrong, So Little Space,\u201d followed by a small-print litany of topics from Ukraine and tariffs to potential education cuts to the denial of climate and vaccine science.\n\nAround her in Atlanta were hundreds of people marching and chanting about a range of Trump initiatives. There were Palestinian flags and Ukrainian flags, along with signs bemoaning Trump ending military aid to Ukraine as it fights off the invading Russian troops of Vladimir Putin.\n\nTrump was called a fascist, a \u201cRussian asset,\u201d \u201cPutin\u2019s Puppet\u201d and \u201cWannabe King,\u201d among other, more profane monikers. One signed implored \u201cPunch Nazis,\u201d reflecting an increasingly common effort to compare Trump\u2019s presidency to Nazi Germany. Musk was a frequent target of mockery and ire. But there were also appeals for transgender rights, abortion rights and diversity. One understated sign appealed simply, \u201cSave Our Parks.\u201d\n\nPeople hold up signs as they protest the Trump administration outside City Hall, Tuesday, March 4, 2025, in San Francisco.

    "title": "EEUU cancela duplicar aranceles a acero canadiense luego que Ontario suspende aumento a electricidad",
    "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 La amenaza que lanz\u00f3 el presidente Donald Trump el martes de duplicar los aranceles sobre el acero y el aluminio canadiense del 25% al 50% llev\u00f3 al gobierno de la provincia de Ontario a ordenar la suspensi\u00f3n de su plan de aplicar recargos al precio de la electricidad que vende a Estados Unidos.\n\nComo resultado, el asesor comercial de la Casa Blanca, Peter Navarro, dijo que el presidente estadounidense dio marcha atr\u00e1s en su decisi\u00f3n de duplicar los aranceles sobre el acero y el aluminio, aunque el gobierno federal a\u00fan planea imponer un gravamen del 25% sobre todas las importaciones de acero y aluminio a partir del mi\u00e9rcoles.\n\nLa respuesta de Canad\u00e1 represent\u00f3 una victoria para Trump, pero tambi\u00e9n aument\u00f3 las preocupaciones en torno a las medidas arancelarias que han agitado al mercado de valores y suscitado riesgos de una recesi\u00f3n. La escalada y el enfriamiento en la actual guerra comercial entre Estados Unidos y Canad\u00e1 \u00fanicamente incrementaron la creciente sensaci\u00f3n de incertidumbre sobre c\u00f3mo los aumentos de aranceles de Trump afectar\u00e1n a las econom\u00edas de ambas naciones.\n\nTrump estremeci\u00f3 los mercados la ma\u00f1ana del martes al afirmar que el aumento de los aranceles que entrar\u00eda en vigor el mi\u00e9rcoles hab\u00eda sido una respuesta al aumento del 25% en el precio de la electricidad que Ontario vende a Estados Unidos.\n\n\u201cHe ordenado a mi secretario de Comercio para que a\u00f1ada un arancel adicional del 25%, llev\u00e1ndolo al 50%, sobre todo el acero y aluminio que ingresa a Estados Unidos desde Canad\u00e1, una de las naciones con los aranceles m\u00e1s altos de cualquier lugar del mundo\u201d, public\u00f3 Trump el martes en su plataforma Truth Social.\n\nEl primer ministro de Ontario, Doug Ford, declar\u00f3 el martes por la tarde que recibi\u00f3 una llamada del secretario de Comercio de Estados Unidos, Howard Lutnick, tras la cual acord\u00f3 eliminar el incremento de precios. A\u00f1adi\u00f3 que estaba seguro de que el presidente de Estados Unidos tambi\u00e9n dar\u00eda marcha atr\u00e1s a sus propios planes de aranceles del 50% sobre el acero y el aluminio canadienses.\n\n\u201cTiene que consultarlo con el presidente, pero estoy bastante seguro de que dar\u00e1 marcha atr\u00e1s\u201d, dijo Ford sobre la amenaza de Trump de gravar el acero y aluminio. \u201cDe ninguna manera vamos a someternos. Lo que vamos a hacer es tener una conversaci\u00f3n constructiva\u201d.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de la ca\u00edda en los mercados del lunes y el subsecuente nerviosismo el martes, Trump se enfrenta a una creciente presi\u00f3n por demostrar que cuenta un plan s\u00f3lido para hacer crecer la econom\u00eda. Hasta ahora, el mandatario ha ratificado su postura sobre los aranceles y puede se\u00f1alar el drama del martes como evidencia de que los impuestos sobre las importaciones son una valiosa herramienta de negociaci\u00f3n, incluso si generan agitaci\u00f3n en el mercado de valores.\n\nTrump insinu\u00f3 el martes que los aranceles son fundamentales para cambiar la econom\u00eda de Estados Unidos, independientemente de las oscilaciones del mercado de valores.\n\nEl mandatario estadounidense ha dado distintas explicaciones para su antagonismo hacia Canad\u00e1. Se\u00f1al\u00f3 que sus aranceles del 25% sobre todas las importaciones, algunos de los cuales quedaron suspendidos durante un mes, se deben al contrabando de fentanilo, y ha expresado objeciones a que Canad\u00e1 imponga altos grav\u00e1menes a las importaciones de productos l\u00e1cteos que castigan a los granjeros estadounidenses. Tambi\u00e9n ha mantenido su llamado para que Canad\u00e1 se convierta en parte de Estados Unidos como soluci\u00f3n, una forma de burla que ha enfurecido a los gobernantes canadienses.\n\n\u201cLo \u00fanico que tiene sentido es que Canad\u00e1 se convierta en nuestro querido quincuag\u00e9simo primer estado\u201d, public\u00f3 Trump el martes. \u201cEsto har\u00eda que todos los aranceles, y todo lo dem\u00e1s, desaparezca por completo\u201d.\n\nTensiones entre Estados Unidos y Canad\u00e1\n\nEl primer ministro entrante de Canad\u00e1, Mark Carney, dijo que su gobierno mantendr\u00e1 los aranceles hasta que los estadounidenses muestren respeto y se comprometan con el libre comercio, despu\u00e9s de que Trump amenaz\u00f3 con una devastaci\u00f3n financiera hist\u00f3rica para Canad\u00e1.\n\nCarney, quien tomar\u00e1 posesi\u00f3n en lugar de Justin Trudeau en los pr\u00f3ximos d\u00edas, dijo que los m\u00e1s recientes aranceles de Trump son un ataque a los trabajadores, las familias y las empresas canadienses.\n\n\u201cMi gobierno mantendr\u00e1 nuestros aranceles hasta que los estadounidenses nos muestren respeto y asuman compromisos cre\u00edbles y fiables con el comercio libre y justo\u201d, dijo Carney en un comunicado.\n\nLos funcionarios canadienses planean imponer aranceles de represalia en respuesta al gravamen sobre el acero y el aluminio, los cuales se tiene previsto que se den a conocer el mi\u00e9rcoles.\n\nCarney se refer\u00eda la primera ronda de aranceles de represalia de Canad\u00e1 por 30.000 millones de d\u00f3lares canadienses (21.000 millones de d\u00f3lares estadounidenses) que se han aplicado a productos estadounidenses, como el jugo de naranja, la mantequilla de cacahuate, el caf\u00e9, los electrodom\u00e9sticos, el calzado, los cosm\u00e9ticos, las motocicletas y determinados productos de pulpa y papel.\n\nTrump tambi\u00e9n ha impuesto a M\u00e9xico aranceles del 25% debido a su descontento con el narcotr\u00e1fico y la inmigraci\u00f3n ilegal, aunque suspendi\u00f3 durante un mes los impuestos a las importaciones que cumplen con el pacto comercial T-MEC firmado en 2020.\n\nCuando se le pregunt\u00f3 sobre si M\u00e9xico tem\u00eda enfrentarse a los mismos aranceles del 50% sobre el acero y el aluminio que Canad\u00e1, la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum, dijo: \u201cNo, nosotros somos respetuosos\u201d.\n\nTrump particip\u00f3 el martes en una sesi\u00f3n de preguntas y respuestas con Business Roundtable, una asociaci\u00f3n comercial de CEO a la que cortej\u00f3 durante la campa\u00f1a de 2024 con la promesa de tasas impositivas corporativas m\u00e1s bajas para los fabricantes nacionales. Pero sus aranceles sobre Canad\u00e1, M\u00e9xico, China, y posiblemente m\u00e1s sobre Europa, Brasil, Corea del Sur, medicamentos farmac\u00e9uticos, cobre, madera y microprocesadores\u2014 equivaldr\u00edan a un enorme aumento de impuestos.\n\nEl voto de desconfianza del mercado de valores durante las \u00faltimas dos semanas pone al presidente en un dilema entre su entusiasmo por gravar las importaciones y su imagen como un pol\u00edtico que entiende de negocios basado en sus propias experiencias en bienes ra\u00edces, medios y marketing.\n\n\u201cLos aranceles est\u00e1n teniendo un impacto sumamente positivo \u2014 lo tendr\u00e1n, y lo est\u00e1n teniendo\u201d, declar\u00f3 Trump ante la reuni\u00f3n de CEO, afirmando que los impuestos a las importaciones har\u00edan que m\u00e1s f\u00e1bricas se reubiquen en Estados Unidos.\n\nAumentan las preocupaciones de una recesi\u00f3n\n\nEl economista de la Universidad de Harvard Larry Summers, secretario del Tesoro durante el gobierno de Bill Clinton, calcula que las probabilidades de una recesi\u00f3n son 50-50. El banco de inversi\u00f3n Goldman Sachs ajust\u00f3 a la baja su pron\u00f3stico de crecimiento para este a\u00f1o: de 2,2% a 1,7%. Aument\u00f3 modestamente su probabilidad de recesi\u00f3n al 20% \u201cporque la Casa Blanca tiene la opci\u00f3n de revertir los cambios de pol\u00edtica si los riesgos a la baja comienzan a parecer m\u00e1s serios\u201d.\n\nTrump ha tratado de asegurar al p\u00fablico que sus aranceles causar\u00edan una cierta \u201ctransici\u00f3n\u201d para la econom\u00eda, en la que los impuestos han impulsado a m\u00e1s empresas a comenzar un proceso de varios a\u00f1os para reubicar sus f\u00e1bricas en Estados Unidos a fin de evitar los aranceles. Pero el domingo encendi\u00f3 las alarmas durante una entrevista en la que no descart\u00f3 una posible recesi\u00f3n.\n\nContin\u00faa el desplome del mercado de valores\n\nLa promesa de grandes cosas por venir no elimin\u00f3 la ansiedad, y el \u00edndice burs\u00e1til S&P 500 cay\u00f3 2,7% el lunes, lo que ha borrado las ganancias con las que el mercado recibi\u00f3 la victoria electoral de Trump en noviembre de 2024. El \u00edndice S&P 500 cay\u00f3 aproximadamente un 0,8% en las operaciones del martes por la tarde, recuper\u00e1ndose de una ca\u00edda inicial despu\u00e9s de que Ontario dio marcha atr\u00e1s a su incremento en los precios de la electricidad.\n\nTrump ha confiado desde hace tiempo en el mercado de valores como un indicador econ\u00f3mico y pol\u00edtico a seguir, s\u00f3lo para aparentemente ignorarlo mientras sigue decidido hasta ahora a imponer aranceles. Cuando gan\u00f3 las elecciones el a\u00f1o pasado, proclam\u00f3 que quer\u00eda que se considerara que su mandato hab\u00eda comenzado el 6 de noviembre de 2024, el d\u00eda de las elecciones, en lugar de la fecha de su toma de posesi\u00f3n del 20 de enero de 2025, para que se le pudieran atribuir las ganancias burs\u00e1tiles postelectorales.\n\nTrump tambi\u00e9n advirti\u00f3 repetidamente de una ca\u00edda libre de la econom\u00eda si perd\u00eda las elecciones.\n\n\u201cSi no gano tendr\u00e1n una depresi\u00f3n al estilo de 1929.

    "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A public memorial service bursting with music, including planned performances by Stevie Wonder and a surprise one by Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, celebrated the life and legacy of the Grammy-winning singer and pianist Roberta Flack.\n\nFlack, whose intimate vocal and musical style made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died last month at age 88.\n\nShe\u2019s best-known for her transformative covers of \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\u201d and \u201cKilling Me Softly With His Song.\u201d Both were expertly handled by Hill at the ceremony held Monday afternoon at New York\u2019s Abyssinian Baptist Church.\n\nWonder followed the set and the Rev. Al Sharpton gave the eulogy.\n\nFlack \u201cput a soundtrack to Black dignity,\u201d Sharpton said.\n\nAs many said in their tributes, Flack\u2019s musical genius stemmed from her ability to seamlessly move between soul, jazz, gospel and beyond.\n\nHer \u201cCelebration of Life\u201d memorial was livestreamed at www.RobertaFlack.com and on YouTube.\n\nHere are some highlights:\n\nFor the memory of a singing legend, a historic location\n\nFlack\u2019s memorial was open to the public at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, a historic Harlem institution. Founded in 1808, it is one of the oldest Black Baptist churches in the U.S.\n\nThe church was decorated for the ceremony with stunning white and yellow bouquets. Seats filled quickly. At center, a screen showed a young Flack at the piano and played highlights of her career. Later, it would broadcast music industry legends paying tribute to Flack, including Clive Davis,Dionne Warwick, India.Arie and Alicia Keys.\n\nIt was a fitting location for such a celebration: Flack grew up with church gospel and her mother played organ at the Lomax African Methodist Episcopal Church in Arlington, Virginia. As a teen, she began accompanying the church choir on piano.\n\nThe ceremony detoured from a program handed out to attendees. It featured a powerful quote from Flack on the back that Arie would include in her message.\n\n\u201cRemember: Always walk in the light,\u201d Flack once said. \u201cIf you feel like you\u2019re not walking in it, go find it. Love the Light.\u201d\n\nCelebrating a life in music \u2014 through music\n\n\u201cHer existence was a form of resistance,\u201d Hill said in her speech, holding back tears.\n\nHill\u2019s appearance was unexpected but fitting. In the 1990s, her hip-hop trio the Fugees did a masterful take on Flack\u2019s cover \u201cKilling Me Softly With His Song.\u201d It won the group a Grammy, two decades after Flack took home the record of the year trophy for the song.\n\n\u201cI adore Ms. Roberta Flack,\u201d she said. \u201cRoberta Flack is legend.\u201d\n\nShe then launched into a cover of \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\u201d followed by \u201cKilling Me Softly With His Song\u201d with the Fugees\u2019 Wyclef Jean \u2014 and Wonder joining in on harmonica.\n\nA legend who needed no introduction but certainly received one with roaring applause, Wonder followed up.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about not having the ability to see with your eyes is the great opportunity of being able to even better see with your heart. And so I knew how beautiful Roberta was, not seeing her visually but being able to see and feel her heart,\u201d Wonder said.\n\nHe performed his song \u201cIf It\u2019s Magic,\u201d accompanied only by a harpist. Then he sat at the piano to sing with the harpist a song he wrote for Flack, \u201cI Can See the Sun in Late December.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you, Roberta. And I will see you,\u201d Wonder said at the end.\n\nEarlier, songwriter and performer Valerie Simpson of Ashford & Simpson played piano and sang an extended take of \u201cAin\u2019t Nothing Like the Real Thing\u201d interspersed with recollections of her friend.\n\n\u201cBut that voice. Aw, she\u2019d just grab you in the heart. And then when she touched the keys, she knew how to dig down deep,\u201d Simpson said.\n\nSimpson recalled being tapped to perform in \u201cChicago\u201d for her 2018 Broadway debut and how she told Flack she wasn\u2019t sure if she could act.\n\n\u201cShe looked at me and said, \u2018Girl, where\u2019s the script? Bring it over here. We\u2019re going to work on this thing. We\u2019re going to do this,\u2019\u201d remembered Simpson.\n\nNew Orleans singer and piano player Davell Crawford performed a soulful version of Flack\u2019s song \u201cJust When I Needed You\u201d to celebratory shouts and cheers.\n\nA legendary artist remembered\n\n\u201cMany of us are here today because she has touched not just our hearts but she also touched our souls,\u201d said the Rev. Dr. Kevin R. Johnson, the senior church pastor who led the service.\n\nChoir performances including a rousing rendition of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d came in between a video recollection of Flack\u2019s life and scripture readings.\n\n\u201cThe reason we\u2019re here is because she made a difference,\u201d Sharpton said. And we should all ask ourselves when it comes our time, will they pack a church for you? If Roberta were here tonight, she would tell you, \u2018Don\u2019t just praise me, emulate me.\u2019\u201d\n\nActor Phylicia Rashad remembered first seeing Flack perform when she was a student at Howard University \u2014 to an audience that grew rapt by her quiet, steady voice.\n\nFlack lived comfortably with her genius and without having to proclaim it to people, Rashad said.\n\n\u201cShe wore that like a loose fitting garment and lived her life attending to that which she cared for most: music, love and humanity,\u201d Rashad said.\n\n___\n\nMead Gruver contributed to this report from Cheyenne, Wyoming.",

    "title": "Fed Chair Powell says interest rates on hold with economic uncertainty widespread",
    "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Federal Reserve is likely to keep its key interest rate unchanged in the coming months as it waits for widespread \u201cuncertainty\u201d stemming from President Donald Trump\u2019s policies to resolve, Chair Jerome Powell said Friday at a conference in New York.\n\nPowell said the Trump administration is making policy changes in several areas, including trade, taxes, government spending, immigration and regulation, and added that the \u201cnet effect\u201d of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the Fed\u2019s interest rate policies.\n\n\u201cWhile there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAs we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\u201d\n\nMost economists say that Trump\u2019s plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.\n\nPowell\u2019s comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the Fed may deliver this year. They had been banking on at least three following a stream of weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. But Powell reiterated the Fed is likely on hold for a while. That sent Treasury yields higher in the bond market.\n\nRate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans.\n\nPowell, in a question and answer session, acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a \u201cone-time\u201d price increase, rather than persistent inflation, and the Fed could ignore such a temporary effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday made a similar argument: \u201cWe could get a one-time price adjustment,\u201d Bessent said, before adding, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about inflation.\u201d\n\nYet Powell also said there were other considerations the Fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged, or even raise rates. For example, Powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a one-time impact \u201cif it turns into a series\u201d of tariff hikes, or \u201cif the increases are larger, that would matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\u201d Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.\n\nExpectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation. Some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase.\n\nWhen Trump imposed tariffs in his last administration, Powell noted, the Fed ended up reducing its key rate, \u201cbecause growth weakened so much.\u201d\n\nPowell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \u201celevated uncertainty.\u201d He characterized Friday\u2019s jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \u201csolid\u201d gains of the past six months.\n\nHe also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \u201cpoint to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\u201d Further complicating matters, he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment \u201chave not been a good predictor\u201d of consumer spending in recent years.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.\n\nPowell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy\u2019s growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year\u2019s final quarter.\n\nYet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \u201cgood news\u201d cuts and \u201cbad news\u201d cuts. \u201cBad news\u201d cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \u201cgood news\u201d reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.\n\nWaller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \u201cgood news\u201d rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed\u2019s next meeting this month.\n\nAfter cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank\u2019s preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June.",

    "title": "Coco Gauff heads home to the Miami Open after her 21st birthday and a bit of a rough patch",
    "body": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff shrugged her right shoulder and chuckled a bit Monday at the notion that she seems to elicit concern from others when she goes through a two- or three-match losing streak \u2014 a rough patch in the course of a long season.\n\n\u201cSometimes when I don\u2019t do well, people think there\u2019s something personally wrong with me,\u201d Gauff said on the eve of the Miami Open, where the women begin main-draw play on Tuesday and the men get started Wednesday.\n\nBow out early at one event or two \u2014 or drop a trio of outings consecutively, as she did at the Australian Open, Qatar and Dubai in January and February \u2014 and fans or former players will ask the 2023 U.S. Open champion, who just turned 21 last week, whether she\u2019s OK.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018I just lost a couple of matches! I\u2019m chillin\u2019,\u2019\u201d said Gauff, who has a first-round bye because she is seeded No. 3 at the hard-court Masters 1000 event and will get started by taking on another past Grand Slam champion \u2014 Petra Kvitova or Sofia Kenin \u2014 in the second round later in the week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously not happy with those past results, but it\u2019s one of those things that, in the history of my career, I\u2019ve had ups and downs. I still feel like I have a couple more years ... (to reach) that point where every week is a great week, I guess,\u201d said Gauff, who is based not far from where the Miami Open is played. \u201cI\u2019m also in the middle of changes in my game; it\u2019s been difficult.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s spoken frequently about those switches, which began with adjusting her coaching staff after last year\u2019s U.S. Open and also included adapting her serve \u2014 with a particular eye on shoring up second serves so as to avoid double-fault issues \u2014 and her forehand.\n\nIt\u2019s been clear ever since she burst onto the scene as a 15-year-old qualifier at Wimbledon in 2019, beating seven-time major champion Venus Williams along the way to reaching the fourth round, that Gauff\u2019s backhand is nothing if not elite, while her forehand is the shot that opponents tend to go after.\n\nThe American\u2019s most recent match was a three-set loss to Tokyo Olympics gold medalist Belinda Bencic at Indian Wells, California, in the fourth round last week. Afterward, Bencic spoke about what her thinking was at 4-all in the final set.\n\n\u201cI felt like she was more tense,\u201d Bencic said about Gauff, \u201cso I felt like that was the right time to go for her forehand.\u201d\n\nGauff called the event held over the next two weeks at the stadium used by the NFL\u2019s Miami Dolphins as her \u201chome tournament.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s 6-5 in Miami and has not made it beyond the fourth round there.\n\nNo matter what others might say to her, or about her, after setbacks, Gauff doesn\u2019t like to harp on it too much \u2014 even if she expects more from herself, too.\n\nThat\u2019s what comes with being ranked as highly as she is. And with having won Grand Slam titles in singles and doubles, along with the season-ending WTA Finals last year.\n\n\u201cI will say that it is tough, sometimes, when everyone is (saying), \u2018Oh, (lost) two matches in a row,\u2019 and things like that,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cBecause if I wasn\u2019t a top-five player it wouldn\u2019t, probably, be a conversation. That comes with being at the top. You\u2019re expected to win. And I expect myself to win, as well.\u201d\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP\u2019s tennis writer since 2002.

    "body": "Across-the-board cuts at the Social Security Administration are prompting questions about how the benefits of millions of recipients may be affected.\n\nAmong the potential changes are layoffs for more than 10% of the agency\u2019s workforce and the closure of dozens of offices throughout the U.S. It\u2019s all part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, inspired by President Donald Trump\u2019s adviser Elon Musk.\n\nSome of the public-facing locations listed for closure were already slated to be shuttered due to lack of use. The SSA says work in other non-public sites up for closure is being consolidated.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at cuts to the agency, which serves more than 70 million Americans, and potential effects for recipients:\n\nWill the Social Security office near my home close?\n\nOn its website, DOGE lists 47 Social Security Administration field offices set for closure across the U.S., with many concentrated in the South and across the Southeast.\n\nAn agency spokesperson said last week that most of the leases not being renewed were for spaces used for in-person hearings, sites no longer necessary due to the majority of hearings now being held virtually. In the 2024 fiscal year, according to SSA, 20% of those offices held no in-person hearings.\n\nSome of the other properties had already been set for closure, or were being consolidated anyway, the spokesperson noted, saying the agency was working with the General Services Administration \u201cto review our leases and ensure they are used efficiently.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Social Security Administration, the agency has about 1,200 field offices across the U.S.\n\nWill my Social Security benefits be cut?\n\nNot necessarily, but advocates have claimed that agency reductions will result in diminished services.\n\nThe 72.5 million Social Security beneficiaries across the country include retirees and children who receive retirement and disability benefits.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has characterized Musk\u2019s cuts to the agency as efforts to \u201cattack the bedrock of America\u2019s social safety net.\u201d\n\nSocial Security is one of the nation\u2019s largest and most popular social programs. A January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that two-thirds of U.S. adults think the country is spending too little on Social Security.\n\nThe program faces a looming bankruptcy date if it is not addressed by Congress. The May 2024 Social Security and Medicare trustees\u2019 report states that Social Security\u2019s trust funds \u2014 which cover old age and disability recipients \u2014 will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. Then, Social Security would be able to pay only 83% of benefits.\n\nWhat about Social Security employee layoffs?\n\nEarlier this week, a person familiar with the agency\u2019s plans but not authorized to speak about them publicly said that the Social Security Administration was preparing to lay off at least 7,000 people from its workforce of 60,000.\n\nAccording to the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, administering the program amounts to less than 1% of the revenue that funds it.\n\nAdvocates and Democratic lawmakers have warned that layoffs and agency cuts will reduce the agency\u2019s ability to serve recipients in a timely manner.\n\nIn a letter last month to acting Social Security Administrator Michelle King, Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York wrote that the White Plains hearing office in her state has 2,000 pending cases, saying \u201cbeneficiaries will be required to travel between 24 and 135 miles\u201d to get to another office if it closes.\n\nWhat has the Trump administration said about Social Security?\n\nIn an episode with podcaster Joe Rogan airing last month, Musk called Social Security \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\u201d\n\nBut Trump, who during the presidential campaign vowed to make no changes to the program, has consistently said there would be no changes to benefits. Since his election in November, the Republican has reiterated those comments, saying Social Security benefits \u201cwon\u2019t be touched\u201d and \u201cwill only be strengthened.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Fatima Hussein contributed from Washington.\n\n___\n\nKinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina, and can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP.",

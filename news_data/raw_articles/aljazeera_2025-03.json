    "body": "A powerful earthquake has hit Myanmar and neighbouring Thailand, destroying buildings, damaging infrastructure and killing more than 150 people.\n\nThe head of Myanmar\u2019s military government, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, said that at least 144 people were killed and 730 others were injured in his country. The quake also hit Thailand, where at least 10 people were killed in the capital, Bangkok, according to city authorities.\n\nA magnitude 7.7 quake struck just outside Myanmar\u2019s ancient capital Mandalay at 12.50pm (06:20 GMT). The initial tremor was followed minutes later by a magnitude 6.4 aftershock, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).\n\nPhotos from Myanmar\u2019s current capital, Naypyidaw, showed multiple buildings used to house civil servants destroyed by the quake and rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble.\n\nGeneral Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar\u2019s military government said the death toll was expected to rise and invited \u201cany country\u201d to provide help and donations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in earthquakes in this region before, and I\u2019ve never felt anything as strong as that,\u201d said Al Jazeera\u2019s Tony Cheng, who was outside Myanmar\u2019s Defence Services Museum in Naypyidaw when the earthquake hit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheng and others sought shelter under a doorway as large roofing and side panels crashed down. The tremors began gently but quickly intensified, causing concrete panels to break off the building, he said.\n\nIn the Thai capital, a 33-storey building that was under construction near Chatuchak Market crumpled into a cloud of dust with onlookers seen screaming and running in a video posted on social media.\n\nAt least eight people were killed in the building collapse, Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul was quoted as saying by news agency AFP. He said that 90 to 110 people remained unaccounted for.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Imran Khan, who was in Bangkok when the quake hit, said: \u201cPeople are out on the streets here. None of the trains are moving. \u2026 Traffic is absolutely gridlocked. The buildings have been shuttered in the centre of the city.\u201d\n\nState of emergency\n\nMyanmar\u2019s military government declared a state of emergency in six regions and states, including Naypyidaw and Mandalay.\n\nMajor General Zaw Min Tun, a government spokesperson, told MRTV that blood was in high demand in the hospitals in earthquake-hit areas, especially Mandalay, Sagaing and Naypyidaw.\n\nIn Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second largest city, located in the country\u2019s Buddhist heartland, the earthquake reportedly brought down multiple buildings, including the Ma Soe Yane Monastery, one of the largest in the city, and damaged the former royal palace.\n\nA video posted online showed robed monks in the street shooting video of the multistorey monastery before it suddenly collapsed. It was not immediately clear whether anyone was harmed.\n\nIn the Sagaing region just west of the city, a 90-year-old bridge collapsed, and some sections of the highway connecting Mandalay and Myanmar\u2019s largest city, Yangon, were also damaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Red Cross said downed power lines added to challenges for their teams trying to reach several hard-hit areas.\n\nAt least three people were killed in the town of Taungoo, south of Naypyidaw, when a mosque partially collapsed, according to witnesses who spoke to news agency Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe were saying prayers when the shaking started. \u2026 Three died on the spot,\u201d one of the witnesses said.\n\nLocal media reported at least two people died and 20 were injured when a hotel collapsed in Aung Ban.\n\nA major hospital in Naypyidaw was declared a \u201cmass casualty area\u201d, an official at the facility told the AFP news agency.\n\nRows of wounded were treated outside the emergency department of the 1,000-bed general hospital, some writhing in pain, others lying still as relatives sought to comfort them.\n\nThai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra announced a state of emergency in her country. Meanwhile, Bangkok has been declared a disaster area, the capital\u2019s city hall said on Friday.\n\nUrban rail systems in Bangkok were temporarily closed but were expected to resume services on Saturday.\n\nTremors were also felt in the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in China. They caused injuries and damage to houses in the city of Ruili on the border with northern Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nVideos that one outlet said it had received from a person in Ruili in Yunnan showed building debris littering a street and a person being wheeled on a stretcher towards an ambulance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCambodia, Bangladesh and India also reported tremors.\n\nHumanitarian response\n\nJulie Mehigan, head of Asia, the Middle East and Europe for Christian Aid, said the earthquake would have left many people \u201cdevastated\u201d in war-torn Myanmar, which is already experiencing a significant humanitarian crisis.\n\n\u201cMyanmar is one of the least developed countries in the world. Even before this heartbreaking earthquake, we know conflict and displacement has left countless people in real need,\u201d she said.\n\nWorld Health Organization spokeswoman Margaret Harris said at a media briefing that the earthquake was a \u201cvery, very big threat to life and health\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve activated our logistics hub to look particularly for trauma supplies and things like external fixators because we expect that there will be many, many injuries that need to be dealt with,\u201d she said.\n\nMarie Manrique, programme coordinator for the International Federation of the Red Cross, told reporters in Geneva via videolink from Yangon that the organisation anticipates the impact to be \u201cquite large\u201d.\n\n\u201cPublic infrastructure has been damaged, including roads, bridges and public buildings. We currently have concerns for large-scale dams that people are watching to see the conditions of them,\u201d she said.\n\nPrevious quakes in Myanmar\n\nEarthquakes are relatively common in Myanmar, where six strong quakes of magnitude 7 or higher struck from 1930 to 1956 near the Sagaing Fault, which runs north to south through the centre of the country, according to the USGS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA magnitude 6.8 earthquake in the ancient capital Bagan in central Myanmar killed three people in 2016, toppling spires and crumbling temple walls at the tourist destination.\n\nThe impoverished Southeast Asian nation has a strained medical system, especially in its rural states.\n\nMoreover, Cheng said it is important to remember that Myanmar is a country in the grips of a bitter civil war.\n\n\u201cA lot of the people have moved from the countryside into the cities to try and escape,\u201d he noted. \u201cThat has meant it is densely overcrowded and the building standards are not particularly strong.\u201d",

But as Turkiye came up against restrictions on what weapons it could purchase and how it could use them, that switched to local production.\n\nIn the 2010s, it switched focus to domestic design, resulting in a huge increase in domestic defence production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, thousands of Turkish defence manufacturers span land, air, and naval capabilities, which is being increasingly recognised internationally.\n\nHave you heard about Turkish drones?\n\nPerhaps the most famous Turkish unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is the iconic Bayraktar TB2, first deployed in 2014, one of the most widely purchased Turkish defence products.\n\nThere are several others, however, including the medium-altitude long-endurance Anka-S, which has a payload of 200kg (441lb), and the Vestel Karayel tactical UAV with a 70kg (154lb) payload.\n\nThe country is also working on its \u201cSteel Dome\u201d (Celik Kubbe), described as a system that, augmented by AI, can identify and intercept any airborne threat.\n\nAdditionally, work is ongoing on the first domestic fifth-generation fighter, the Turkish KAAN, which aims to replace aging American F-16s in the Turkish Air Force.\n\nWhat else is in Turkiye\u2019s catalogue?\n\nOn the ground, Turkiye\u2019s armoured vehicle production is spearheaded by the Altay main battle tank, designed to rival Western models such as the German Leopard or the US Abrams.\n\nThe army also has a mine-resistant vehicle, the Kirpi (Hedgehog), widely used in counterinsurgency operations, as well as modern infantry fighting vehicles like the FNSS Defence Systems\u2019 Kaplan and the Pars.\n\nThere\u2019s also naval production, with MILGEM (Milli Gemi Projesi, or the National Ship Project), which was set up in 2004 to produce the next generation of Turkish naval class ships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMILGEM has produced state-of-the-art Ada-class corvettes and Istanbul-class frigates, with plans for more advanced warships and submarines.\n\nMost remarkable is the amphibious drone-carrying assault ship, the TCG Anadolu, the largest ship in the Turkish navy, which was deployed in 2023.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a long list of smart munitions, air defence systems, and missiles, such as the Bora short-range ballistic missile and the long-range Atmaca (Hawk) missiles.\n\nWhy the interest in arms manufacturing?\n\nTurkiye\u2019s push to develop military hardware can be said to be as much a result of outside forces as internal drivers.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the United States put an arms embargo on Turkiye over its military intervention in Cyprus.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Germany instituted an export ban on arms to Turkiye, saying armoured cars it sold to Turkiye had been used domestically when the contract had specified they could only be used against an attack by a non-NATO state.\n\nThen in 2020, the US sanctioned Turkiye over its purchase of the Russian S-400 air defence system, by which time Turkiye was already established as an arms manufacturer.\n\nToday, there are about 3,000 weapons companies in Turkiye.\n\nSo how much is Turkiye exporting?\n\nExports have increased so they now comprise 1.7 percent of global arms exports, putting the country in 11th place for the period from 2020 to 2024 in the ranking of the world\u2019s defence exporters, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to monitors, during the last year, Turkiye\u2019s exports reached 178 countries, marking a 103 percent increase compared with 2015-2019.\n\nIts main customers in the 202-2024 period were the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and Qatar, according to SIPRI.\n\nAs for its most famous export, the Bayraktar medium-altitude long-endurance drone has reportedly been exported to at least 31 countries, including Iraq, Ukraine, Kenya, Bangladesh and Japan.\n\nLast year, its manufacturer Baykar announced the investment of $300m in developing its own jet engines, aiming to take on more component production and avoid international supply chain challenges.\n\nIt aims to develop an in-house engine for its Akinci drone, then a turbofan engine for Kizilelma, an unmanned air-to-air combat vehicle that is under development. So far, both use Ukrainian engines.",

    "body": "The prospect of deep cuts to Medicaid, the United States government programme to provide healthcare to low-income people, has become a flashpoint in Congress as leaders of both parties accuse their counterparts of lying.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democratic Party leader in the House of Representatives, said on February 27 that a Republican budget measure would \u201cset in motion the largest cut to Medicaid in American history\u201d and Republicans are hiding the consequences.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans are lying to the American people about Medicaid,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cI can\u2019t say it any other way. Republicans are lying. Prove me wrong.\u201d\n\nRepublicans said Democrats were distorting the Republican budget. Congressman Steve Scalise said: \u201cThe word Medicaid is not even in this bill.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said on CNN that Republicans don\u2019t want to cut Medicaid \u201cand the Democrats have been lying about it.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are looking for massive budget savings to meet their goal of fully extending President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts. This is a separate process from Congress\u2019s need to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government running by Friday or else face a federal government shutdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what we know so far about potential Medicaid cuts.\n\nHouse Republican budget plan seeks $880bn in cuts\n\nMedicaid serves about one in five Americans. The healthcare programme is paid for by the federal government and partly by states. Louisiana, home to Johnson and Scalise, has one of the highest state proportions of Medicaid enrollees.\n\nThe House Republican budget plan adopted on February 25 opens the door to slashing Medicaid even though it doesn\u2019t name the programme.\n\nThe plan directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find ways to cut the deficit by at least $880bn over the next decade.\n\nThe committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid, Medicare and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in addition to much smaller programmes. CHIP offers low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nRepublicans ruled out cuts to Medicare, the health insurance programme for senior citizens, which leaders cut at their political peril. Medicare is about 15 percent of the federal budget, and Medicaid is about 8.6 percent.\n\nWhen Medicare is set aside, Medicaid accounts for 93 percent of the funding under the committee\u2019s jurisdiction, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found in a March 5 analysis. That means it is impossible for the committee to find enough cuts that don\u2019t affect Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy to imply that federal Medicaid assistance won\u2019t be cut very deeply,\u201d said Allison Orris, an expert on Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Medicaid, the next largest programme under the committee\u2019s jurisdiction is CHIP. Lawmakers don\u2019t appear to be planning to wipe out CHIP, but even if they did, they would be only a \u201cfraction of the way there\u201d, said Joan Alker, an expert on Medicaid and CHIP at Georgetown University in Washington, DC.\n\nIf Medicare cuts are off the table, the only way to achieve $880bn in savings is through big Medicaid cuts, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health policy organisation.\n\nAndy Schneider, a professor at Georgetown who served in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration as a senior adviser at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said even if the committee eliminated all other programmes entirely, it could achieve only $381bn in savings \u2013 about 43 percent of the target.\n\n\u201cIn short, if they don\u2019t want to cut Medicaid [or CHIP], and they don\u2019t want to cut Medicare, the goal of cutting $880bn is impossible,\u201d Schneider said.\n\nThe $880bn cut is not a done deal. House Republicans were able to pass their budget package, but Senate Republicans are taking a different approach and haven\u2019t proposed such significant cuts.\n\nAny finalised budget blueprint would need Senate Republicans\u2019 buy-in. Senator Josh Hawley is among Republicans who have spoken against potential cuts. He told the HuffPost: \u201cI would not do severe cuts to Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe numbers are starting points that may lead to negotiation among at least Republicans, Joe Antos, a healthcare expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said. \u201cWe are a long way from final legislation, so it\u2019s not possible to predict how much any programme will be cut,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf the bill also includes extending the [Trump 2017] tax cuts, we are probably months away from seeing real language,\u201d Antos said.\n\nOnce the House and Senate reach an agreement on language and the resolution passes both chambers, the committees would work on detailed cuts. To enact such cuts, both chambers would need to approve a separate bill and receive Trump\u2019s signature.\n\nWhy eliminating fraud doesn\u2019t solve the problem\n\nRepublican leaders have deflected concerns about Medicaid cuts by talking about a different target: Medicaid fraud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we\u2019re going to get fraud out of there,\u201d Trump said in an interview on the Fox News channel on Sunday in keeping with his campaign rhetoric that he would protect those programmes.\n\nAt the same time, Trump praised the House resolution that would make cuts highly likely: \u201cThe House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!\u201d he said in a social media post.\n\nWould eliminating fraud solve the Medicaid problem? No.\n\nOn CNN, Johnson said cutting fraud, waste and abuse would result in \u201cpart of the savings to accomplish this mission\u201d. He said the government loses $50bn a year in Medicaid payments \u201cjust in fraud alone\u201d.\n\nBut Johnson conflated \u201cfraud\u201d with \u201cimproper payments\u201d. The Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm that examines the use of public funds, found about $50bn in improper payments in Medicaid and the same amount in Medicare in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose improper payments were made in an incorrect amount (overpayment or underpayment), should not have been made at all, or had missing or insufficient documentation. But that doesn\u2019t mean there was $50bn in Medicaid fraud, which would involve obtaining something through wilful misrepresentation.\n\nThe system used to identify improper payments is not designed to measure fraud, so we don\u2019t know what percentage of improper payments were losses due to fraud, Schneider said.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s a drop in the overall bucket of the potential $880bn in cuts.",

    "title": "Can Europe guarantee Ukraine\u2019s security without the US?",
    "body": "European nations are working on security guarantees for Ukraine against Russia with, Trump making clear that the US won\u2019t. But can they?\n\nHuddling in London over the weekend, European leaders declared that they would work to pull together a plan to end the war in Ukraine, but with security guarantees for the country that has been the victim of a full-scale Russian invasion since February 2022.\n\nThe meeting in the United Kingdom followed close on the heels of a disastrous visit to the White House by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which he was publicly berated by United States President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance for resisting their plans for an unconditional peace plan with Russia.\n\nTrump has made it clear that the US will not provide security guarantees for Ukraine, urging Europe\u2019s military forces to take charge instead.\n\nIn meetings with Trump in Washington, DC last week, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer both indicated a willingness to send troops to Ukraine as peacekeepers if a deal to end Russia\u2019s war is reached.\n\nBut can Europe meaningfully provide a security cover to Ukraine, without the US backing it? What are Europe\u2019s true security capabilities? How dependent is the region on US support? And what threat does Russia pose?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat role does the US play in European security?\n\nThe US has been central to European security since the end of World War II, when it helped create the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and deployed hundreds of thousands of soldiers to Europe to challenge Soviet influence. It has maintained this security leadership ever since, while also expanding its global superpower status.\n\nAs of July 2024, the US had about 65,000 active-duty soldiers permanently stationed across Europe, along with extensive weaponry, defence systems and other assets vital to NATO, according to the US government\u2019s Defense Manpower Data Center.\n\nThis includes six pre-positioned weapons stockpiles in Europe, equipped with tanks and armoured vehicles, eight air squadrons, four navy destroyers and an estimated 100 nuclear bombs. Additionally, the US has some 10,000 soldiers on rotational deployment in Poland \u2013 a key part of NATO\u2019s eastern flank with Russia.\n\nTo fund its military muscle, the US relies on a mammoth defence budget, which stood at $860bn in 2024. That is more than double that of all other combined members of NATO, who are bound to defend each other in the event of an attack.\n\nAt the same time, the US has provided the majority of direct military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded it in 2022, sending approximately $65bn, according to the US Department of State. When accounting for other types of assistance, the US had allocated approximately $183bn to the Ukraine response as of September 30, 2024, according to Ukraine Oversight, a website created by the US government to record aid sent to Ukraine. The European Union, for its part, has sent a total of $141bn in aid to Ukraine, including $51bn in military assistance, according to the European Commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Trump has said it is now time for the US to step back militarily from Europe and wants its allies in the continent to do more heavy lifting.\n\n\u201cStark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe,\u201d declared Trump\u2019s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at a meeting of NATO allies on February 12. \u201cEuropean allies must lead from the front.\u201d\n\nHow strong are NATO\u2019s European allies?\n\nNATO\u2019s European members have a combined two million active-duty soldiers, a small section of whom are assigned directly to serve under the alliance\u2019s command. Turkiye and Poland have the most soldiers, with 481,000 and 216,000 respectively, according to NATO\u2019s latest estimates.\n\nFrance and Germany follow, with 205,000 and 186,000 soldiers. The UK, which has offered to send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine under a potential peace deal, has 138,000 soldiers. NATO itself has a force of about 40,000 throughout its eastern flank \u2013 spanning Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nTogether, NATO\u2019s European allies have some 7,000 aircraft, 6,800 tanks, 2,170 military ships and six aircraft carriers, according to the Global Firepower defence index.\n\nHow would NATO fare if the US scales down?\n\nDespite its significant military assets, NATO still heavily depends on the US to deter threats in Europe. In the event of a major attack on one of their own, such as by Russia, NATO would likely expect the US to rush hundreds of thousands of additional troops to Europe, according to economic think tank Bruegel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Europe can no longer rely on this support, enhanced by Washington\u2019s advanced military technology and infrastructure, Bruegel estimates the continent would need to create 50 new brigades, each consisting of thousands of soldiers, to fill the gap.\n\nConcerned, European states are feeling the pressure to increase their defence spending.\n\nLast week, the UK announced it would increase defence spending to 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2027. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said this would add some $16bn every year to the defence budget, which currently stands at $68bn. \u201cThis government will begin the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War,\u201d Starmer told Parliament.\n\nGermany had announced a special fund of more than $100bn to upgrade and strengthen its military in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, adding to its annual defence budget of some $52bn. Last year, the country\u2019s defence budget hit 2 percent of GDP for the first time since the end of the Cold War as part of a NATO target set in 2014 following Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea. Germany\u2019s presumptive next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, in a December speech, stressed that the military would need \u201cat least $84bn a year\u201d in the future.\n\nFollowing Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, NATO allies across Europe and Canada increased their spending by an unprecedented 18 percent. Currently, 22 of 30 European NATO members spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defence, as per their 2023 pledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Trump has argued that is not nearly enough, calling for the states to boost defence spending to at least 5 percent of GDP.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has acknowledged Europe\u2019s need to invest more. \u201cWe have not paid enough over the last 40 years, particularly since the Berlin Wall came down,\u201d Rutte told Politico on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on February 15. \u201cThe US is rightly asking for a rebalancing of that. It\u2019s totally logical.\u201d\n\nHow does Russia view NATO?\n\nRussia has cited NATO\u2019s expansion as one of its justifications for invading Ukraine. Since its founding in 1949, NATO has grown from 12 to 32 members, steadily moving eastward towards Russia\u2019s borders. Currently, six NATO members \u2013 four of which joined since the turn of the millennium \u2013 border Russia, including Finland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.\n\nTo keep the Western military alliance at bay, Moscow has demanded that Ukraine, which has long sought NATO membership, be kept out of the grouping.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, this problem will continue to poison the atmosphere on the European continent,\u201d said Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on February 18. Trump\u2019s administration, pushing for a quick end to the war, has said NATO membership is not \u201crealistic\u201d for Ukraine.\n\nBut Western European states view Russia\u2019s aggression as a reason to strengthen the bloc. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia, the world\u2019s largest nuclear power, has invaded or occupied parts of several nearby countries \u2013 Moldova, Georgia, and most recently Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia\u2019s direct military intervention in Moldova in the early 1990s helped Russian-aligned separatists gain de facto control of the breakaway region of Transnistria. Russia\u2019s blistering invasion of Georgia in 2008 dealt a heavy blow to Tbilisi and complicated its ties with the West.\n\nSince the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, NATO has grown. Previously neutral Finland and Sweden have joined the alliance over the past two years.\n\nHow strong is Russia\u2019s military?\n\nCurrently, Russia has at least 1.32 million active-duty soldiers, hundreds of thousands of whom are fighting in Ukraine. Moscow had previously stationed about 12,000 soldiers in Kaliningrad, its westernmost enclave, sandwiched between NATO members Poland and Lithuania. However, most of these forces were reportedly redeployed to Ukraine earlier in the conflict.\n\nRussia also operates dozens of overseas military facilities, most located in former Soviet states. As of 2024, this includes at least two major bases in Belarus, two in Kazakhstan, two in Armenia, two in the disputed Georgian territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and one base each in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Moldova\u2019s breakaway region of Transnistria, according to the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies. The largest of these facilities is the 201st military base in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, which, as of 2022, had an estimated 7,000 Russian soldiers.\n\nIn terms of military assets, Russia has 4,292 aircraft, 5,750 tanks, 449 ships and one aircraft carrier, according to Global Firepower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this capacity does not match NATO\u2019s combined strength, it would present a tougher test if the US were to step back, as Trump has called for.\n\n\u201cEuropeans need to wake up,\u201d said EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas at a conference of the European Defence Agency on January 22. The continent\u2019s \u201cfailure to invest in military capabilities\u201d, she said, \u201csends a dangerous signal to the aggressor. Weakness invites them in.\u201d",

    "body": "Al Trautwig, one of the most recognizable sports broadcasters in New York and a fixture at numerous international sporting events for more than three decades, has died. He was 68.\n\nTrautwig\u2019s son, Alex, told The Associated Press his father died Sunday at his home on Long Island from complications of cancer.\n\nTrautwig was part of MSG pre- and postgame broadcasts of the NBA\u2019s Knicks, NHL\u2019s Rangers and Major League Baseball\u2019s Yankees. He also worked 16 Olympics, the Indianapolis 500, the Tour de France and the U.S. Open tennis tournament, and won four national Emmy Awards and more than 30 in New York.\n\n\u201cAl was a staple on MSG Networks\u2019 Knicks, Rangers and Yankees coverage for more than 30 years, and his passion for the teams he covered was undeniable,\u201d MSG said in a statement. \u201cHe leaves behind one of the great legacies in New York sports broadcasting history. Our thoughts and prayers are with Al\u2019s family and friends.\u201d\n\nFor many fans watching games on TV in New York, Trautwig\u2019s voice was often the first they heard. With a natural storytelling style, he used his pregame introductions to make big games at Madison Square Garden or Yankee Stadium feel even bigger, while rarely needing to raise the level of his voice.\n\nMSG Networks studio analyst Alan Hahn, who called Trautwig a friend, mentor and a career resource of support, said the accomplished sportscaster \u201cwas a skilled host who knew how to make every game feel like something you don\u2019t want to miss.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe lost a legendary voice in sports. But we lost a lot more than that,\u201d Hahn wrote in a series of social media posts. \u201cAl Trautwig had an amazing voice and knew how to use it the way a tenor could bring depth and intensity to a song. ...

    "title": "A joke petition seeks to help Denmark buy California as Trump eyes Greenland",
    "body": "Is California for sale? A lighthearted petition to buy the state of California for Denmark prompted more than 200,000 signatures by Wednesday in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s talk about taking control of Greenland, a vast and mineral-rich Arctic island.\n\n\u201cHave you ever looked at a map and thought, \u2018You know what Denmark needs? More sunshine, palm trees, and roller skates,\u2019\u201d the petition asks. \u201cWell, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make that dream a reality.\n\n\u201cIt is in the national interest to promote the extraordinary heritage of our Nation, so California will become New Denmark. Los Angeles? More like L\u00f8s \u00c5ngeles,\u201d it says.\n\nXavier Dutoit, the petition\u2019s organizer, got the idea last month while vacationing in the Philippines. He overheard an American tourist loudly discussing Trump\u2019s Greenland pitch.\n\n\u201cThat American didn\u2019t seem to grasp how unhinged and absurd it was for any country\u2019s President \u2014 especially in a stable democracy that the USA claims to be \u2014 to offer or threaten to take over another sovereign country\u2019s territory,\u201d Dutoit wrote in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nWhile Dutoit is not Danish \u2014 he is Swiss-French \u2014 he consulted a multi-national group of friends who are helping him, including Kenneth Haar, who is Danish and lives in Copenhagen.\n\n\u201cThe Trump-Greenland issue is, by far, the biggest political issue in this country at the moment,\u201d Haar told AP in a Zoom interview. \u201cIt is considered a very depressing and a very dangerous situation.\u201d\n\nWhile L\u00f8s \u00c5ngeles is a joke, there is another city in Southern California with a very real connection to the land of Vikings, Lego and Hans Christian Andersen. Known as \u201cthe Danish capital of America,\u201d Solvang was founded by three immigrants from Denmark in 1911.\n\nThe city is popular with tourists, who come in droves for its aebleskiver pastries (similar to fritters), Scandinavian windmills, a main street called \u201c Copenhagen Drive \u201d and, of course, a Hans Christian Andersen Museum to honor the famous Danish fairy tale author. Danish royals have visited several times over the decades.\n\nIn 2019, Trump scrapped a trip to Denmark, blaming Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen for making a \u201cnasty\u201d statement when she rejected his first-term idea of buying Greenland as an absurdity. Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally and fellow member of NATO.\n\nBefore taking office again last month, Trump said he would not rule out the use of military force to seize control of Greenland, calling it vital to U.S. national security, and last month his son visited the island.\n\nM\u00fate B. Egede, Greenland\u2019s prime minister, shot back: \u201cGreenland is for the Greenlandic people. We do not want to be Danish, we do not want to be American. We want to be Greenlandic.\u201d\n\nHaar said California\u2019s appeal to Danes is obvious, from its towering mountains to its sunny beaches.\n\n\u201cWe have none of that here,\u201d he said. \u201cDenmark is a pretty flat country with a pretty boring climate.\u201d\n\nThe petition organizers even have their own plans for Disneyland in Southern California: \u201cWe\u2019ll rename it Hans Christian Andersenland. Mickey Mouse in a Viking helmet? Yes, please.\u201d\n\nThe petition notes that Trump isn\u2019t a fan of the Golden State. Last year, he called it \u201cParadise Lost\u201d and he regularly derides Gov. Gavin Newsom with the nickname \u201cNewscum.\u201d\n\nBut of course, every petition needs some fine print, way down at the bottom:\n\n\u201cDisclaimer: This campaign is 100% real \u2026 in our dreams.\u201d",

    "title": "Inflation and a pivot in US to healthier snacks weighs on PepsiCo in the fourth quarter",
    "body": "PepsiCo said Tuesday that high prices and changing consumer tastes have weakened U.S. demand for its snacks and drinks but it\u2019s confident it can turn that around in the coming year.\n\nThe Purchase, New York-based company said its revenue fell slightly to $27.78 billion in the fourth quarter. That was short of Wall Street\u2019s forecast of $27.89 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nU.S. demand flagged last year after two years of outsized, double-digit price increases. The average price of a 16-ounce bag of potato chips peaked at $6.68 in October 2023, according to government data.\n\nPepsiCo hit the brakes on prices, which rose 4% globally in 2024. The company focused on making its snacks more affordable, adding product promotions, more chips per bag and value packs. It also invested more heavily in its Chester\u2019s and Santitas value brands, which saw strong revenue growth last year.\n\nIn a conference call Tuesday, CEO Ramon Laguarta said those efforts are paying off and consumers have begun buying salty snacks again. Still, North American sales volumes for both Frito-Lay snacks and beverages fell 3% in the October-December period.\n\nPepsiCo is also closely watching a longer-term trend toward healthier snacking, Laguarta said. The company isn\u2019t seeing much impact from the growing use of GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy, he said. But people are looking for smaller, portion-controlled snacks, healthier ingredients like whole grains and lower sodium and fat.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a higher level of awareness in general of American consumers toward health and wellness,\u201d he said.\n\nPepsiCo is well-positioned to meet that need with products like Pepsi Zero Sugar, SunChips and its Simply line of chips, which have no artificial colors or flavors, Laguarta said. And more healthy, \u201cpermissible\u201d snacks are coming, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very confident that our North American business will accelerate this year,\u201d Laguarta said.\n\nPepsiCo is also trying to amp up its away-from-home offerings, like its Doritos Locos Tacos collaboration with Taco Bell and its Tostitos Cantina food trucks.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s snack food and beverage volumes both climbed 1% globally in the fourth quarter, with strong growth in Africa and Asia.\n\nNet income rose 17% to $1.5 billion. Adjusted for one-time items, PepsiCo earned $1.96, or two cents better than analysts had forecast.\n\nPepsiCo expects organic revenue growth in the low single digits in 2025.

    "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Michelle Trachtenberg, a former child star who appeared in the 1996 \u201cHarriet the Spy\u201d hit movie and went on to co-star in two buzzy millennial-era TV shows \u2014 \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl\u201d \u2014 has died. She was 39.\n\nPolice responded to a 911 call shortly after 8 a.m. at a 51-story luxury apartment tower in Manhattan\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood where officers found Trachtenberg \u201cunconscious and unresponsive,\u201d according to an NYPD statement.\n\nParamedics pronounced her dead at the scene. No foul play was suspected.\n\nTrachtenberg\u2019s family objected to an autopsy, the New York City\u2019s Office of Chief Medical Examiner said Thursday. Because there was no evidence of criminality, the medical examiner\u2019s office honored the objection, limiting its findings. Such objections are allowed by law. The cause and manner of her death are listed as undetermined.\n\n\u201cThe family requests privacy for their loss,\u201d Trachtenberg\u2019s representative, Gary Mantoosh, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nTrachtenberg was 8 when she began playing Nona Mecklenberg on Nickelodeon\u2019s \u201cThe Adventures of Pete & Pete\u201d from 1994 to 1996 and then starred in the title role in the film adaptations of \u201cHarriet the Spy\u201d and \u201cInspector Gadget,\u201d opposite Matthew Broderick.\n\n\u201cMichelle comes off as genuine because she really is a genuine kid. Everyone can identify with her,\u201d said Debby Beece, president of Nickelodeon Movies in 1996.\n\nIn 2000 Trachtenberg joined the cast of \u201cBuffy,\u201d playing Dawn Summers, the younger sister of the title character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar between 2000 and 2003.\n\nTrachtenberg thanked Gellar for speaking out against Joss Whedon in 2021, following abuse allegations made against the \u201cBuffy\u201d showrunner. \u201cI am brave enough now as a 35-year-old woman to repost this,\u201d she wrote on social media, and alluded to \u201chis not appropriate behavior\u201d she experienced as a teenage actor.\n\nIn 2001, she received a Daytime Emmy nomination for hosting Discovery\u2019s \u201cTruth or Scare.\u201d Trachtenberg went on to recurring roles on \u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d \u201cWeeds\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl,\u201d where she played the gang\u2019s scheming nemesis, Georgina Sparks.\n\nFor her fan-favorite role, she was nominated as a TV villain at the Teen Choice Award in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a lot more fun than playing the good girl,\u201d she told Seventeen in 2009. I love the reaction you get. I never understood why some actors don\u2019t want to play villains or evil characters.\u201d\n\nShe was one of the original series\u2019 stars to return for a pair of guest appearances in the 2021 \u201cGossip Girl\u201d revival.\n\nBlake Lively on Instagram on Tuesday honored her \u201cGossip Girl\u201d co-star: \u201cThe world lost a deeply sensitive and good person in Michelle. May her work and her huge heart be remembered by those who were lucky enough to experience her fire.\u201d\n\nAs if to cement herself in millennial culture, Trachtenberg made a cameo in Fall Out Boy\u2019s music video for the \u201cThis Ain\u2019t a Scene, It\u2019s an Arms Race\u201d alongside Seth Green.\n\nHollywood took to social media to mourn one of their own, one who had made the transition from kid star to teen queen to adult actor. \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d co-star David Boreanaz said on Instagram it was \u201cso very sad.. horrible news.\u201d Melissa Gilbert, who starred with Trachtenberg in the 1996 film \u201cA Holiday for Love,\u201d wrote on Instagram: \u201cMy heart aches for your family and all those who loved you so.\u201d\n\nRosie O\u2019Donnell, who starred alongside Trachtenberg in her \u201cHarriet the Spy\u201d debut, said her death was \u201cheartbreaking:\u201d \u201cI loved her very much. She struggled the last few years. I wish I could have helped.\u201d Glee star Chris Colfer remembered her this way: \u201cMichelle was the absolute sweetest and one of the most supportive people I knew,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTrachtenberg\u2019s later credits included \u201cIce Princess\u201d in 2005, playing a math prodigy and aspiring figure skater. The AP said it had \u201ca good, though feeble, heart and the best of intentions\u201d and said Trachtenberg was \u201cmining the same nervous twitter from her kid-sister days on \u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe New York City-born Trachtenberg also appeared in the 2004 teen sex comedy \u201cEuroTrip,\u201d she co-starred with Zac Efron and Leslie Mann in 2009\u2019s \u201c17 Again\u201d and played a murderous stalker and abductor on an episode of \u201cCriminal Minds.\u201d\n\nFor \u201cKilling Kennedy,\u201d the 2013 film in which she played the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald, around 80% of Trachtenberg\u2019s dialogue was in Russian. She had learned the language from her mother growing up.\n\nOther credits included supporting roles in the films \u201cMysterious Skin\u201d in 2004 and \u201cBlack Christmas\u201d in 2006. She also starred on the NBC medical series \u201cMercy\u201d (2009\u20132010) opposite Taylor Schilling. More recently, she hosted the true-crime docuseries \u201cMeet, Marry, Murder\u201d on Tubi.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Michael R. Sisak contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThis story first moved Feb. 26, 2025, and was updated on Feb. 27, 2025, to reflect that Trachtenberg\u2019s cause of death was being listed as undetermined.",

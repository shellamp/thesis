    "title": "Stitch Fix: Short-Term Pop Won't Fix Longer Term Issues (NASDAQ:SFIX)",
    "body": "Photosomnia/E+ via Getty Images\n\nWall Street loves a good rebound story, but the critical question is if turnarounds can be sustained. One of the stocks that surprised us over the past month is Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX), the e-commerce company that used to be known for sending its customers a box of five stylist-curated items called \"Fixes,\" from which customers selected their favorites and sent the rest back.\n\nWhen the novelty of this approach receded, and especially amid weaker consumer spending post-pandemic, Stitch Fix started to tank. But an early-June fiscal Q3 (April quarter) earnings print started to reverse the story, and Stitch Fix has now rallied from its YTD lows and is up nearly 10% year to date.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nBut again, we have to ask critically: is the company capable of retaining this rally? In my view, the answer is no.\n\nI last wrote a bearish note on Stitch Fix in April, when the stock was trading in the ~$2 range. And while I certainly didn't foresee the post-Q3 earnings pop, I am standing by my sell rating on this stock as a plethora of short and long-term risks have emerged.\n\nStitch Fix primarily popped on the company's outlook for Q4.\n\nStitch Fix Q4 outlook (Stitch Fix Q3 earnings materials)\n\nFor Q4, as shown above, the company has guided to revenue declining \"only\" -14% to -12% y/y, which is a sequential improvement from a -16% decline in Q3 and a -18% decline in the preceding Q2. The midpoint of the company's guidance range of $317 million is $10 million, or ~3 points of growth, better than Wall Street's $306.6 million initial expectations.\n\nThat being said: we have to recall how Stitch Fix is getting there. Earlier this year, the company noted that it would be throwing all of its resources behind improving customer retention, through a combination of both heavier marketing spend plus increasing customers' touchpoints with its human stylists. All of these efforts are going to be costly, and as reflected in the guidance, the company is expecting only a 1.6-3.1% adjusted EBITDA margin: the midpoint of which is lower than 2.7% in the prior year Q4, and the peak 4.0% margin that Stitch Fix hit in 2021. The company is effectively eroding the gross margin benefits it's gaining from selling a higher mix of private label items by spending more on sales outreach.\n\nHere are several other core risks to be mindful of here:\n\nStitch Fix's unique elements have lost their novelty; is it just a fad now? The idea of getting a \"Fix\" of five items and keeping only what you like was the whole selling point behind Stitch Fix in the first place. But declining active customers seem to be suggesting that people don't want this complexity in the shopping process. In fact, Stitch Fix introduced its direct-buy \"Freestyle\" program to mirror classic e- tailers : And in doing so, it lost its niche in the first place. Without much of a powerful brand to draw from, it's unclear how Stitch Fix plans to remain relevant.\n\nThe idea of getting a \"Fix\" of five items and keeping only what you like was the whole selling point behind Stitch Fix in the first place.

Uniqlo, Zara, and a number of upstart direct-to-consumer brands have exploded on the retail scene. Amid \"basic convenience\" buyers, it's unclear where Stitch Fix fits in.\n\nUniqlo, Zara, and a number of upstart direct-to-consumer brands have exploded on the retail scene. Amid \"basic convenience\" buyers, it's unclear where Stitch Fix fits in. Losing customers despite higher marketing spend. Despite Stitch Fix's efforts to draw more customers in, it keeps bleeding active clients.\n\nSteer clear here: Stitch Fix is very likely to unwind its recent rally.\n\nQ3 download\n\nTo me, despite the above-expectations guidance in Q4, the company's actual results in Q3 did little to inspire continued confidence in this name. Take a look at the Q3 earnings summary below:\n\nStitch Fix Q3 results (Stitch Fix Q3 earnings materials)\n\nRevenue declined -16% y/y to $322.7 million, which beat Wall Street's expectations of $306.2 million (-20% y/y) by a four-point margin. Revenue growth did accelerate two points from a -18% y/y decline in Q2, but we also have to note that the company's comps are getting easier as we are lapping very weak sales in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Stitch Fix's core problem of losing clients has continued to feature prominently. The Q3 ending client count was 2.63 million, down -20% y/y and representing a loss of 172k clients from Q2 alone.\n\nStitch Fix Q3 customer metrics (Stitch Fix Q3 earnings materials)\n\nAnd we also point out that this is in spite of Stitch Fix spending 53% of its revenue on selling, general and administrative expenses (five points higher than 48% in the year-ago quarter) and 9% on advertising (two points higher than 7% in the year-ago quarter), which more than nullified three points of higher gross margins from a higher mix of private label sales.\n\nThere are small product tests that the company is running to try to improve results. One new initiative is \"quick fixes,\" which gives customers the optionality to add a second fix upon checkout. CEO Matt Baer noted that this effort has helped to boost average order values on the Q3 earnings call:\n\nIn Q3, we leveraged our analytics capabilities to improve the profitability of fixed transactions while strengthening client satisfaction. Following a robust analysis of client interactions, we found opportunities to reduce underperforming shipments. As an example, we currently offer quick fixes, which provide clients the option to schedule an additional fix immediately following checkout. Utilizing our proprietary demand algorithms, we improve the performance of Quick Fix\u2019s by only offering them to clients when we know the new fixes have a high likelihood of success. Within three weeks of this change, Quick Fix average order value improved by 25%.\"\n\nThat said, new initiatives plus the company's heightened expense on advertising has cut sharply into profitability. Adjusted EBITDA declined -50% y/y to $7 million as shown in the chart below, while adjusted EBITDA margins of 2.1% were 140bps weaker y/y:\n\nStitch Fix adjusted EBITDA (Stitch Fix Q3 earnings materials)\n\nKey takeaways\n\nWith Stitch Fix's customer base continuing to recede despite heavier efforts in advertising, I continue to be wary of Stitch Fix despite the stock's recent rebound in confidence. Longer term, I find it very difficult to believe that the company can compete in a world of much larger and better-recognized fast fashion giants. Continue to steer clear here and invest elsewhere.",
    "summary": "When the novelty of this approach receded, and especially amid weaker consumer spending post-pandemic, Stitch Fix started to tank.\nI last wrote a bearish note on Stitch Fix in April, when the stock was trading in the ~$2 range.\nThe idea of getting a \"Fix\" of five items and keeping only what you like was the whole selling point behind Stitch Fix in the first place.\nWithout much of a powerful brand to draw from, it's unclear how Stitch Fix plans to remain relevant.\nWithout much of a powerful brand to draw from, it's unclear how Stitch Fix plans to remain relevant.",

    "body": "Send questions about the office, money, careers and work-life balance to workfriend@nytimes.com. Include your name and location, or a request to remain anonymous. Letters may be edited.\n\nA Salutation Situation\n\nI work in a very fast-paced, fairly large (over 500, under 1,000 people) work environment. Most staff are in person five days a week, with the exception of some specialist staff who were hired in a remote capacity. We use an in-house office chat function similar to Slack for communication (in addition to phones, email). There is remote team member who comes down to the office perhaps one or two times a month for a couple of days. When this colleague reaches out to team members via the Slack platform, he will frequently just say \u201cHi <Name>\u201d with no follow-up. And then, the \u201cHi\u201d just sits there, and languishes. And it freaks people out! And confuses people. And is deemed as not a great mode of communication. And everyone talks about it! But no one provides him with any feedback! How can someone deliver the feedback that he would benefit being a little bit more forthcoming? Or are we all just obstinate and are not being understanding of a different communication style?\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nThis sounds annoying and weird and, yes, confusing and bizarre and off-putting. It makes me feel crazy, and I\u2019ve only just read your email! Also, I have questions! For one thing: Is he saying \u201cHi <Name>\u201d as a way to start a conversation about work with the colleague to whom his \u201chi\u201d is directed? Or is he, uh, just saying \u201chi\u201d? Anyway, if it makes you feel any better, it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s him. It\u2019s definitely him. And though I can think of a few very passive-aggressive ways you could respond to creepy salutations, I\u2019m not going to share them here. However, it\u2019s interesting to note that neither you \u2014 nor I, at least at first \u2014 seem to have considered that one option may be to simply, and straightforwardly, tell this co-worker to cut it out. Except it\u2019s not that simple. Delivering feedback about a person\u2019s personal \u2014 or, in this case, professional \u2014 communication style requires a light touch. It\u2019s a tricky situation: You want what you say to be understood by your colleague without being overshadowed by his potential embarrassment or defensiveness. In other words, you want to be clear, but kind.\n\nSo, might I suggest the following: Inject a little honest levity into the exchange with a digital-speak acronym or some sort of emoji. Send the guy a direct message and say, \u201cHey [insert co-worker\u2019s name], when you write \u2018hi\u2019 without any follow-up, it freaks me out!\u201d and append the message with an \u201clol\u201d or a laughing emoji. If you don\u2019t have the sort of relationship with him that feels conducive to doing this, then my suggestion is to just sit tight and swallow your irritation. You can\u2019t always have the last word.",

    "title": "Acuity Brands: Good Prospects But Moving To The Sidelines On Valuations (NYSE:AYI)",
    "body": "asbe/E+ via Getty Images\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nAcuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) should deliver good revenue growth in the coming quarters thanks to its healthy backlog and improved order pipeline in the infrastructure business. Further, the company\u2019s revenue growth should benefit from its expansion into new verticals like refueling stations and horticulture. In addition, the company\u2019s focus on product vitality and innovation should contribute to volume growth and improve pricing/mix.\n\nOn the margin front, the company\u2019s margins should benefit from operating leverage on higher sales, product vitality initiatives, and margin-accretive acquisitions. Further, the full integration of the Optotronics business should also contribute to margin growth. While I like the company\u2019s growth prospects, I can\u2019t say the same for its valuation. The stock has seen a ~50% increase since my previous bullish article and is trading in line with its historical averages on consensus FY25 P/E. I believe the company\u2019s growth prospects are already reflected in the stock. So, I am moving to the sidelines and rating AYI neutral.\n\nRevenue Analysis and Outlook\n\nOver the last few quarters, the company has been seeing downbeat revenue trends due to macroeconomic headwinds and challenges from difficult Y/Y comparisons in its Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls (ABL) segment.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the ABL segment also faced some labor shortage-related issues that impacted the company\u2019s ability to meet production targets. As a result, the segment saw a Y/Y decline in sales across its independent sales network, direct sales network, retail sales, and OEM and other channels. This decline more than offset sales growth in its corporate accounts, which benefitted from a large retail relight project and much easier comparisons as it lapped last year\u2019s 24.9% decline.\n\nOn the other hand, the Intelligent Spaces Group (ISG) segment\u2019s sales grew by 15% Y/Y driven by higher sales of Distech products and contribution from the acquisition of KE2 Therm.\n\nOn a consolidated basis, the company\u2019s net sales declined by 3.2% Y/Y to $968.1 million as sales decline in the ABL segment more than offset higher sales in the ISG segment.\n\nAYI\u2019s Historical Revenue Growth (Company Data, GS Analytics Research)\n\nLooking forward, I am optimistic about the company\u2019s revenue growth outlook.\n\nOn its last earnings call, management noted that the company\u2019s order rates consistently exceeded shipments last quarter, resulting in a healthy backlog growth. Further, the company also noted increased quoting activity, particularly in the infrastructure sector, which indicates a healthy order pipeline. This backlog growth and improved order pipeline should translate into good sales growth in the coming quarters as management addresses labor shortages and related production issues.\n\nThe company is also expanding into new verticals such as refueling stations and horticulture, where there is a good demand for sustainable and efficient lighting solutions. Further, the company continues to expand its solutions from Intelligent Spaces business across geographies. Last quarter, the company continued to add system integrator capability in the UK, Australia, and Asia as a part of geographic expansion.\n\nIn my last article, I mentioned Acuity\u2019s focus on product vitality and innovation to be a key revenue driver in the medium to long run. The company has continued to introduce new and improved products such as Lithonia FRAME and advanced lighting solutions from A-Light, Luminis, and Eureka. The company\u2019s acquisition of Optotronics a few years ago also has given it more control of technology in its luminaries and provided significant flexibility both in design and operations, driving innovation. In addition to helping volumes, the company\u2019s focus on innovation should also help the company in terms of pricing/mix.\n\nMargin Analysis and Outlook\n\nIn Q3 2024, despite a 3.2% Y/Y net sales decline, the company saw a 200 bps Y/Y increase in gross margin to 46.7% and a 100 bps Y/Y increase in adjusted operating margin to 17.3%. This increase was attributed to product vitality initiatives, effective price/cost management, and productivity gains, which more than offset the impact of lower net sales and higher production costs.\n\nOn a segment basis, the ABL and ISG segments grew adjusted operating margin by 100 bps Y/Y and 340 bps Y/Y, respectively.\n\nAYI\u2019s Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin (Company Data, GS Analytics Research)\n\nAYI\u2019s Segment-Wise Adjusted Operating Margin (Company Data, GS Analytics Research)\n\nLooking forward, I am optimistic about the company\u2019s margin improvement prospects. The company\u2019s revenue outlook is positive and the company\u2019s margins should benefit from operating leverage due to increasing sales. The company\u2019s margins should also benefit from the product vitality initiatives, as the new/improved products usually command better pricing and margins. Further, the company has fully integrated the Optotronics business acquired a few years back, which should enable it to have more flexibility both in design and operation. This vertical integration should also improve margins.\n\nThe company has also been implementing a bolt-on acquisition strategy and acquiring a high-margin business (KE2 Therm is a good example). I expect management to continue implementing this strategy, which should help improve the margin mix in the long run.\n\nValuation and Rating\n\nAYI stock is trading at 15.41x FY24 consensus EPS estimate of $15.52 and 14.54x FY25 EPS estimate of $16.45. Over the last 5 years, the stock has traded at an average forward P/E of 14.47x.\n\nAYI Consensus EPS estimates (Seeking Alpha)\n\nWhile the company's FY24 P/E is at a premium to its historical valuations, its FY25 P/E is almost in line.\n\nMany of the electrical components and equipment companies like Eaton (ETN) and Hubbell (HUBB) are trading at a premium to their historical valuations these days. One reason behind this premium is they supply components related to data centers or grid resiliency, and their end-market demand is benefiting from secular megatrends. However, Acuity Brands is primarily into lighting products and is not as exposed to some of those secular themes. So, I don't think its P/E multiple can re-rate meaningfully above historical levels.\n\nFurther, the company imports ~15% of its finished products and some of the raw components to manufacture its products from Asia. With elections approaching, there is a good chance of debate around import tariffs re-igniting, which might keep some pressure on AYI's valuation multiple. This is another reason why I don't see much probability of P/E multiple re-rating from these levels.\n\nWith the company's EPS expected to grow around 6-7% over the next couple of years (consensus estimates), I believe the stock can give mid-single-digit CAGR assuming P/E remains constant. This is not enough for me to give a buy rating. Last year, when I covered the stock with a buy rating, it was trading at a meaningful discount to its historical levels. However, the stock has given over 50% upside since then. After this meaningful price appreciation, I believe that the current valuations appropriately reflect the company's prospects. Hence, I am downgrading my rating to neutral.\n\nTakeaway\n\nI am optimistic about the company\u2019s revenue and margin growth prospects in the coming quarters. The revenue growth should benefit from a healthy backlog, improved order pipeline, expansion into new verticals, geographic expansion in the ISG segment, and product vitality initiatives. The margins should see gains from operating leverage, product vitality initiatives, accretive M&As, and full integration of Optotronics business. While I like the company\u2019s growth prospects, I am not a fan of its current valuation, which is trading in line with its historical averages. So, I am moving to the sidelines and downgrading my rating to neutral.",

    "title": "Storm Beryl spares Mexico's Yucatan beaches, takes aim at Texas By Reuters",
    "body": "By Paola Chiomante and Jose de Jesus Cortes\n\nCANCUN/TULUM, Mexico (Reuters) -Tropical Storm Beryl was blowing out to the Gulf of Mexico on Friday afternoon and appeared likely to reach Texas by late Sunday, after its strong winds and heavy rain largely spared Mexico's top beach destinations.\n\nThe core of the storm, downgraded from a hurricane, crossed the Yucatan Peninsula by Friday afternoon, with its maximum wind speeds slowing to around 65 miles mph (105 kph) after striking near the coastal beach resort of Tulum in the morning.\n\nThe storm, which at one point intensified to a massive Category 5 hurricane, left a deadly trail of destruction across the Caribbean earlier this week. However, there were no casualties in Mexico, the head of the country's civil protection agency Laura Velazquez said in a press conference on Friday afternoon.\n\nWhile Beryl's passage over Mexico's Quintana Roo and Yucatan states resulted in slower winds, the U.S. National Hurricane Center still forecast dangerous storm surges in the surrounding area.\n\nFor those who hunkered down as Beryl churned overhead, a sense of relief prevailed.\n\n\"Holy cow! It was an experience!\" said Mexican tourist Juan Ochoa, who was staying in Tulum.\n\n\"Really only some plants flew up in the air,\" he said. \"Thank God we're all OK.\"\n\nTourist infrastructure was without major damage in Quintana Roo, the state government said in a statement.\n\nStill, many in the area lost electricity, including 40% of Tulum, said Guillermo Nevarez, an official with Mexico's national electricity company CFE, speaking to local broadcaster Milenio.\n\nCivil protection chief Velazquez said she expected service to be restored in full by Sunday.\n\nAmong Mexico's top tourist getaways, the Yucatan Peninsula is known for its white sand beaches, lush landscapes and Mayan ruins.\n\nStranded tourists camped out in Cancun's international airport on Friday, unsure of when they would make it home.\n\nNora Vento said her flight home to Chile was postponed multiple times, and that her airline's counter was unstaffed.\n\n\"So, I don't know when I will get to Chile,\" she said.\n\nBeryl, currently located over the port of Progreso in Mexico's Yucatan state, was expected to pick up intensity as it enters the Gulf of Mexico and forecast to regain hurricane status and approach the western Gulf coast on Sunday.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for the Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande northward to Sargent, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\nMexico's meteorological service issued a hurricane watch for the northeastern coast of Mexico from Barra el Mezquital to the mouth of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"There is an increasing risk of damaging hurricane-force winds and life-threatening storm surge in portions of northeastern Mexico and the lower and middle Texas Coast late Sunday and Monday where hurricane and storm surge watches have been issued,\" the NHC said.\n\nIt warned that flash and urban flooding were possible across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and eastern Texas from Sunday through the middle of next week.\n\nRainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with localized amounts of 15 inches, is projected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and eastern Texas beginning late on Sunday through the middle of next week.\n\nMexico's national water commission, CONAGUA, flagged a risk of flooding around the tourist hubs, as well as in neighboring Campeche state.\n\nQuintana Roo schools were closed, as were local beaches, and officials lifted a temporary ban on alcohol sales.\n\nBeryl was the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, and this week became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, with scientists pointing to its rapid strengthening as almost certainly fueled by human-caused climate change.\n\nBefore reaching Mexico, Beryl wreaked havoc across several Caribbean islands. It swept through Jamaica, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, in addition to unleashing heavy rainfall on northern Venezuela. It has claimed at least 11 lives, tearing apart buildings while felling power lines and trees.\n\nDestruction in the islands of Grenada was especially pronounced.\n\nPrime Minister Dickon Mitchell pointed to major damage to homes in Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique during a video briefing Thursday night. Parts of the latter two islands suffered \"almost complete devastation,\" he said.\n\n\"Many of our citizens have lost everything.\"\n\nMexico's major oil platforms, primarily located in the southern rim of the Gulf of Mexico, are not expected to be affected or shut down.\n\nBeryl is also expected to have little impact on U.S. offshore oil and gas production, energy companies said on Friday while evacuating personnel from some facilities out of caution.\n\nResearch by the ClimaMeter consortium determined that climate change significantly intensified Beryl. According to the study, the storm's severity, along with its associated rainfall and wind speed, saw an increase of 10-30% as a direct result of climate change.",

    "body": "By Leigh Thomas and Helen Reid\n\nAIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (Reuters) - France's business elite is anxious about volatile politics, inexperienced policymakers, street protests and a possible wave of bankruptcies in the coming months, executives meeting in Provence said ahead of Sunday's parliamentary election.\n\nCorporate leaders gathered on Friday and Saturday in the southern city of Aix-en-Provence for France's annual answer to Davos have been among the main beneficiaries of President Emmanuel Macron's pro-business reforms since he was first elected in 2017.\n\nFar right and left-wing parties want to roll back some of Macron's reforms, ranging from raising the retirement age to scrapping a wealth tax on financial assets.\n\nVoters are set to derail his drive to ease taxes and other constraints on business when -- as it is widely expected -- they hand Macron's party a decisive defeat in an election that polls suggest will give the far right the most seats in parliament.\n\n\"We are very concerned about what's going to happen,\" Ross McInnes, chairman of aerospace company Safran (EPA: ), told Reuters. \"Whatever the political configuration that will come out of Sunday's vote, we are probably at the end of a reform cycle that started ten years ago.\"\n\nWhile business leaders tip-toed around the topic of the election in the public panels, they did not conceal their anxiety on the sidelines over the rise of both the far-right and the far-left.\n\nThe far-right National Rally (RN) will likely fall short of an absolute majority, leaving other parties to figure out whether a coalition can be formed to govern, which is unprecedented in modern France and would likely be unstable.\n\n\"Nothing good ever comes from chaos. I don't know what's going to happen, but this is a country that has seen social unrest before,\" the head of a large French industrial group said.\n\nINEXPERIENCED LEADERS\n\nBusiness leaders voiced concern that politicians standing at the gates of power lacked experience steering the euro zone's second largest economy while they also balked at the prospect that France's already considerable tax burden could grow under the left-wing alliance.\n\nRN leader Jordan Bardella, 28, could become France's youngest prime minister if the party wins a majority in Sunday's election.\n\nThe political uncertainty has already driven up France's cost of borrowing as bond investors demanded the highest risk premiums over equivalent German debt in 12 years after Macron called the snap election last month.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate investors in the real economy are also apprehensive about the political and economic outlook.\n\n\"We've continued to take investment decisions over the past weeks, including in France. But clearly if we had had to make a really major investment decision we probably would have waited to have better visibility,\" said Mathias Burghardt, CEO of Ardian France, a private equity firm.\n\nWith no sign the political volatility will subside anytime soon, the higher financing costs could soon feed through to French companies just as they are preparing to roll over ultra-low-cost loans from the COVID era at higher rates, executives said.\n\n\"That creates a scenario where we expect corporate defaults to continue to rise in France beyond what could have been if such a political disruption didn't happen,\" Ana Boata, head of economic research at the trade credit insurance arm of Allianz (ETR: ), told Reuters.\n\nMacron's pro-business reform drive often jarred with voters, sparking sometimes violent street protests like the yellow vest movement of 2018 or marches last year against an overhaul of the retirement system.\n\nThough he won a second term in 2022, Macron has also failed to connect with many voters, who see him as a product of the closely intertwined political and business elites that run the country.\n\nThe anti-immigration, eurosceptic RN has proposed to roll back Macron's 2023 increase in the retirement age to 64 from 62 and cut taxes on energy, saying these measures would be paid for by slashing welfare spending benefiting immigrants.\n\nMeanwhile the left-wing Popular Front alliance's tax-and-spend programme would bring back a wealth tax and raise the minimum wage by 14% while also scrapping Macron's pensions reform.\n\nA minority government would be constrained by the risk of votes of no confidence, likely making it less able to move ahead with new legislation.\n\nBeyond the possibility of a hamstrung government, business leaders also worried about the knock-on impact RN's anti-immigrant policies are likely to have on France's future workforce.\n\n\"Demographics show us that we need to attract talent,\" said McInnes. \"This country has been sustained by immigration for 300 years.\"",

    "body": "By Erwin Seba and Arathy Somasekhar\n\nHOUSTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Coast Guard warned of possible Texas port closures from Corpus Christi to Houston and began restricting vessel traffic because of Tropical Storm Beryl, which is expected to become a hurricane before making landfall by Monday morning at Port Lavaca.\n\nPort closures could bring to a temporary halt shipments of crude oil to refineries and motor fuels from those plants.\n\nPort condition \"Yankee\" was set by the Coast Guard captain of the port of Corpus Christi on Saturday afternoon, restricting vessel movement in ports from Matagorda Bay, 101 miles (163 km) southwest of Houston, to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nCitgo Petroleum Corp was cutting production at its 165,000 barrel-per-day Corpus Christi, Texas, refinery on Saturday ahead of the approach of Beryl to the Texas coast.\n\nCitgo plans to keep the Corpus Christi refinery running at minimum production as the storm moves up the coast toward a projected landfall at Port Lavaca, a pipeline hub.\n\nOil producer Shell (LON: ) Plc completed the evacuation of workers from its Perdido production platform in the U.S.-regulated Gulf of Mexico ahead of the approach of the storm, the company said on Friday night.\n\nProduction on Perdido was shut prior to the evacuations. Shell said it also evacuated workers from the Whale platform, which is due to start production later this year.\n\nGibson Energy (TSX: ), which operates a large oil terminal in Corpus Christi, said operations were continuing, but it would take further steps depending on the forecast.\n\nThe storm was moving on Saturday with maximum sustained winds near 60 mph (95 kmh), the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe latest forecasts would put Corpus Christi on the dry side of the storm where the lowest winds and least rain could be expected. But Beryl could bring gale-force winds to the port, which is why the Coast Guard restricts traffic or shuts the port.\n\nMost of the northern Gulf's offshore oil and gas production is east of Beryl's forecast track.\n\nU.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore production of about 1.8 million barrels per day accounts for about 14% of total output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Any impact on supplies could push up prices of U.S. oil and offshore crude grades.\n\nOil major Chevron Corp (NYSE: ), among the biggest U.S. offshore producers, said on Friday that production from its operated assets remained normal. But it evacuated nonessential personnel from some of its Gulf of Mexico facilities.\n\nMurphy Oil Corp (NYSE: ) said it has not shut in production or evacuated personnel, and continues to monitor the storm.",

According to data from Santiment, these substantial wallets now exceed 3.19 million coins, a milestone last achieved in November 2018.\n\nOver the past six weeks, these large BTC wallets have been the extreme beneficiaries of the market's volatility. As the price of Bitcoin experienced fluctuations, these wallets added a staggering 212,450 BTC to their holdings. This accumulation represents an increase of 1.05% of the total Bitcoin supply.\n\nSantiment's analysis suggests that these large BTC addresses are likely comprised heavily of exchange liquidity providers. These entities play a crucial role in maintaining the liquidity of Bitcoin across various trading platforms.\n\nWhat's next for BTC price?\n\nBitcoin's price fell to $53,500 per coin on Friday, reaching lows not seen since February. Since then, Bitcoin has pared losses somewhat and was trading at $57,932.57, down 3.4% as of press time.\n\nBitcoin surged to an all-time high of more than $73,700 in March of this year, when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin prices have been consolidating within a well-defined $60,000 to $70,000 range with investor apathy and boredom setting in. This has resulted in widespread indecision and a market unable to create a strong trend in either direction.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the True Market Mean resides at a Bitcoin value of $50,000, which represents the average cost basis per active investor.

    "title": "Far right bids for power as France holds parliamentary election By Reuters",
    "body": "By Gabriel Stargardter\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - France holds a parliamentary run-off election on Sunday that will reconfigure the political landscape, with opinion polls forecasting the far-right National Rally (RN) will win the most votes but likely fall short of a majority.\n\nSuch an outcome could plunge the country into a chaotic hung parliament, severely denting the authority of President Emmanuel Macron. Equally, if the nationalist, eurosceptic RN did win a majority, the pro-business, pro-Europe president could find himself forced into a difficult \"cohabitation\".\n\nMarine Le Pen's RN scored historic gains to win last Sunday's first-round vote, raising the spectre of France's first far-right government since World War Two.\n\nBut after centrist and leftist parties joined forces over the past week in a bid to forge an anti-RN barricade, Le Pen's hopes of the RN winning an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly seem less certain.\n\nPolls suggest the RN will become the dominant legislative force, but fail to reach the 289-seat majority that Le Pen and her 28-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Jordan Bardella believe would allow them to claim the prime minister's job and drag France sharply rightward.\n\nPolls open at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) and close at 6 p.m. in towns and small cities and 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) in larger cities, with initial projections expected the moment voting ends, based on partial counts from a sample of polling stations.\n\nMuch will depend on whether voters follow the calls of leading anti-RN alliances to block the far right from power, or support far-right contenders.\n\nRaphael Glucksmann, a member of the European Parliament who led France's leftist ticket in last month's European vote, said he viewed Sunday's run-off as a simple referendum on whether \"the Le Pen family takes over this country.\"\n\n\"France is on the cliff-edge and we don't know if we're going to jump,\" he told France Inter radio last week.\n\nA longtime pariah for many due to its history of racism and antisemitism, the RN has increased its support on the back of voter anger at Macron, straitened household budgets and immigration concerns.\n\n\"French people have a real desire for change,\" Le Pen told TF1 TV on Wednesday, adding that she was \"very confident\" of securing a parliamentary majority.\n\nEven if the RN falls short, it looks set to more than double the 89 seats it won in the 2022 legislative vote, and become the dominant player in an unruly hung parliament that will make France hard to govern.\n\nSuch an outcome would risk policy paralysis until Macron's presidency ends in 2027, when Le Pen is expected to launch her fourth bid for France's top job.\n\nWHAT NEXT FOR MACRON?\n\nMacron stunned the country and angered many of his political allies and supporters when he called the snap election after a humbling by the RN in last month's European parliamentary vote, hoping to wrong-foot his rivals in a legislative election.\n\nWhatever the final result, his political agenda now appears dead, three years before the end of his presidency.\n\nBardella says the RN would decline to form a government if it doesn't win a majority, although Le Pen has said it might try if it falls just short.\n\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal, who looks likely to lose his job in the post-election shakeup, has dismissed suggestions Macron's centrists could seek to form a cross-party government in the event of a hung parliament. Instead, he would like moderates to pass legislation on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAn RN majority would force Macron into an awkward \"cohabitation\" with Bardella as prime minister, with thorny constitutional tussles and questions on the international stage about who really speaks for France.\n\nIf the RN is deprived of a majority and declines to form a government, modern-day France would find itself in uncharted territory. Coalition building would be difficult for any of the blocs given the policy differences between them.\n\nFrench assets have risen on expectations the RN won't win a majority, with banking shares up and the risk premium investors demand to hold French debt narrowing. Economists question whether the RN's hefty spending plans are fully funded.\n\nAn RN-led government would raise major questions over where the European Union is headed given France's powerful role in the bloc, although EU laws are almost certain to restrict its plans to crack down on immigration.\n\nFor many in France's immigrant and minority communities, the RN's ascent has already sent a clear and unwelcoming message.\n\n\"They hate Muslims, they hate Islam,\" said 20-year-old cinema student Selma Bouziane, at a market in Goussainville, a town near Paris. \"They see Islam as a scapegoat for all of France's problems. So it's bound to be negative for the Muslim community.\"\n\nThe RN pledges to reduce immigration, loosen legislation to expel illegal migrants and tighten rules around family reunification. Le Pen says she is not anti-Islam but that immigration is out of control and too many people take advantage of France's welfare system and creaking public services.",

Francois Lo Presti | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFrench voters are heading to the polls on Sunday for the second and final round of voting in a snap parliamentary election. After an initial ballot suggested the far-right National Rally (RN) group would become the biggest party in France's National Assembly, parties on the center-right and left have joined forces to try to block RN's advance. Both President Emmanuel Macron's \"Together\" (Ensemble) alliance and the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) have called on voters to reject the party in the second round, and have withdrawn candidates in many constituencies where another candidate was better placed to beat the RN. By offering voters a starker choice and fewer candidates, RN's opponents hope that the electorate will opt for the non-RN candidate. Analysts predict that National Rally \u2014 the nationalist, anti-immigrant and euroskeptic party led by 28-year-old Jordan Bardella and party figurehead Marine Le Pen \u2014 is now less likely to be able to achieve an absolute majority (of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly) but is still likely to gather the most votes.\n\nMarine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella at the final rally before the June 9 European Parliament election, held at Le D\u00f4me de Paris - Palais des Sports, on June 2, 2024. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe so-called \"republican front\" strategy being pushed by pro-Macron and left-wing parties has the primary aim of making it substantially more difficult for the RN to obtain an absolute majority. Still, it's unclear how voters will react to a) being told who to vote for by the political establishment; b) being asked to vote for party candidates they might instinctively oppose; and c) to mixed messages from political leaders who are now telling them to vote for rival candidates they were disparaging just a few days ago in the campaign race. \"Several senior figures from the pro-Macron camp have provided different suggestions on what their voters should do,\" Antonio Barroso, deputy director of Research at consultancy Teneo, said in a note Wednesday. \"For instance, former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has said voters should vote neither for the RN nor candidates from the far-left France Unbowed (LFI) party. At the same time, current Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has called for everyone to vote against the RN.\" An opinion poll published by Ifop on July 3 suggested voters might tend toward the centrist pro-Macron or leftwing candidate rather than the RN candidate if that was the choice they were presented with on the ballot paper. If the choice was between a far-left and far-right candidate, however, the picture was more nuanced, showing a split vote. Teneo's Barroso also sounded a note of caution that the poll data related to \"attitudes at the national level, ignoring the local dynamics in each constituency.\"\n\nWhat could happen\n\nThe first poll to be published after the creation of a cross-party anti-RN alliance showed RN and its allies would get 190 to 220 seats, far short of the 289 needed for a majority. The Harris Interactive poll for Challenges magazine, published Wednesday and reported by Reuters, also showed that the center-right Republicans were likely to win 30-50 seats, meaning that even in the best-case scenario, a rightwing-led minority government would be hard to form. The Harris poll showed that the leftist NFP alliance would win 159 to 183 seats, while Macron's Together alliance would win just 110 to 135 seats. Various other parties would win 17 to 31 seats, Reuters reported.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping (not pictured) attend the sixth meeting of the Franco-Chinese Business Council at the Marigny Theater in Paris, France, May 6, 2024. Mohammed Badra / Pool | Via Reuters\n\nIt's unclear whether Macron would consider forming a cross-party coalition with the NFP in the event of a hung parliament. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal suggested this week that moderates in the National Assembly could work together to pass legislation on a case-by-case basis, but little else has been said on the matter as parties focus on maximizing their own vote share.\n\nPolitical analysis by Teneo assesses the chance of a hung parliament is at 35%, a result it said \"would not allow it to negotiate an alliance with other parties in this situation.\" \"Such a scenario would be the most uncertain one, as there would be no easy solution leading to the formation of a government. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has suggested that the 'republican forces' in the National Assembly (i.e., non-RN parties) could coalesce to support a government. However, such a coalition would be difficult to assemble given the differences between the parties' policy preferences.\" Teneo believed there was a 35% chance RN will get close to an absolute majority, in which case it's likely Marine Le Pen would try to court MPs from the The Republicans (LR), a center-right party, and other independent right-wing lawmakers. They put the chance of RN gaining an absolute majority at 30%.\n\nHow we got here\n\nMacron shocked the electorate in early June when he called the ballot after his Renaissance party suffered a drubbing in European Parliament elections at the hands of the National Rally.\n\nJordan Bardella gives his electoral card to vote at a polling station in the first round of parliamentary elections in Garches, in a suburb of Paris, on June 30, 2024.

    "title": "Nvidia will win the race to a $4 trillion market cap\u2014but the long-term big tech battle might be different, experts say",
    "body": "A surprisingly resilient economy and profit-filled AI boom are driving the United States\u2019 big tech giants toward a milestone that would have seemed impossible just a few decades ago. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple have all surpassed the $3 trillion market capitalization mark, and Google and Amazon are following close behind in the $2 trillion range.\n\nCombined, these five tech giants alone are now worth more than $14.5 trillion and make up roughly 32% of the S&P 500. For reference, in 2002, after the dot-com bubble burst, the total market capitalization of every U.S. stock was $11.1 trillion, according to Siblis Research data. Big tech\u2019s performance has been particularly impressive this year, with Nvidia, for example, surging from a $2 trillion market cap to a $3 trillion market cap in under 100 days.\n\nThat begs the question: which tech giant will hit the next big milestone, $4 trillion in market cap, first? Some bears argue that big tech companies\u2019 record run of performance can\u2019t continue forever, given their elevated valuations and the slowing economy, while the bulls believe this is just the beginning of a streak of AI-induced wins for big tech.\n\n\u201cI think, a year from now, we [will] have three $4 trillion market cap companies: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft,\u201d Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told Fortune.\n\nHe argued that many of his peers on Wall Street continue to underestimate the AI revolution and the health of the U.S. economy. \u201cUnless you have a telescope, you can\u2019t find a recession. And the Fed? Their next move is a cut not a hike. So, to me, all signs are bullish,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s 9 pm, and the party goes to 4 am\u2026the haters will hate, continuing to say that this is a bubble.\u201d\n\nNvidia\n\nThere are, of course, a wide range of views on where big tech companies are headed, but many experts are convinced that chip giant Nvidia will be the first to reach the $4 trillion market cap mark, driven by the seemingly unending thirst for its AI-enabling hardware.\n\n\u201cThe first one to get there is likely to be the godfather of AI Jensen [Huang] and Nvidia, because they\u2019re the only game in town\u2014their GPUs are the new oil or gold in the tech world with no real competition,\u201d Ives said.\n\nNvidia stock has surged roughly 160% year to date and more than 3,000% over the past five years. That\u2019s led some analysts to warn that the tech giant\u2019s valuation has become stretched, and doesn\u2019t account for rising competition in the semiconductor market.\n\n\n\nAs David Trainer, founder and CEO of research firm New Constructs, told Fortune\u2019s Shawn Tully last month: \u201cNvidia\u2019s valuation is ridiculous. It\u2019s facing the same curse as Tesla. But when Tesla got profitable, loads of competitors entered the EV space, cutting margins and slowing sales. The same will happen with Nvidia.\u201d\n\nBut Ives noted that even though Nvidia\u2019s shares have surged, its revenues and earnings have followed suit. Nvidia raked in a record $26 billion in revenues and $14.8 billion in net income in the quarter that ended this April. In 2021, during the same quarter, the company had revenues of just $5.8 billion and net income of $1.9 billion.\n\nLouis Navellier, founder and chairman of family office Navellier & Associates, also brushed off the competition argument, claiming Nvidia essentially has a \u201cmonopoly\u201d on key AI chips which will lead to consistent sales and earnings growth for years to come. \u201cAnd, you know, Jensen is kind of like the new Elon, he\u2019s got kind of a cult status,\u201d he said, adding that will continue to drive retail investors in the stock.\n\nNvidia\u2019s market capitalization as of July 5: $3.14 trillion\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s booming cloud business and big investment into ChatGPT creator OpenAI have buoyed its shares over the past few years. But it\u2019s the company\u2019s diverse and sustainable revenue streams that will lead it to a $4 trillion market cap, according to Tim Pagliara, founder and chief investment officer of independent wealth management firm CapWealth.\n\nHe said Nvidia may briefly touch the $4 trillion milestone first, due to what he called the current AI \u201cmania,\u201d but Microsoft will be the \u201cmore sustainable\u201d $4 trillion company.\n\n\u201cThey're embracing AI, but they also have just a tremendous number of things in the pipeline. And I know as a small business owner, we just gladly keep paying them more per user per month for everything from Azure to some of the additional add ons that they have created for security and things like that,\u201d he added, referencing Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing business.\n\nPagliara thinks Microsoft\u2019s big tech rivals have riskier business models as well. Apple is dependent on consumers buying into its new iPhone offerings every few years, and Nvidia is benefiting from a lack of competition in the near term, he said. Meanwhile, Microsoft has multiple avenues for consistent revenue growth from the Azure cloud business and Office 365 to Windows and Linkedin.\n\nMarket cap: $3.48 trillion\n\nApple\n\nWhen it comes to a longer-term outlook, Apple is high on many analysts\u2019 lists because of its potential to use AI to get customers to upgrade their current phones and lure in more iPhone customers. It may not be the first to reach a $4 trillion market cap, but it will get there soon, these bulls say.\n\n\u201cI think over the next two, three years, the largest market cap that we will see is Apple, because they have 2.2 billion iOS devices,\u201d Ives predicted. \u201cConsumer AI is going to go through the walls for Cupertino\u2014they are only in the beginning of an AI-driven supercycle.\u201d\n\nLouis Navellier was also optimistic about Apple\u2019s future, but he said it will need a few \u201clittle breakthroughs\u201d to get more customers to buy new iPhones.\n\nHe pointed to new AI tools and the potential for folding iPhones as examples. \u201cI don't know if they're going to announce that in September, but if they do, it will be a $2,500 phone, and it will sell like crazy and send that stock soaring.\u201d\n\nMarket cap: $3.46 trillion\n\nWhat about Alphabet and Amazon?\n\nThe Google parent\u2019s market cap is currently $2.36 trillion, leaving it well shy of the $4 trillion mark. Analysts said Alphabet will be able to capitalize on the AI revolution, but its missteps with hallucinations have left it behind, and its cloud business isn\u2019t performing as well as others. However, the search giant is taking talent from its peers in an attempt to catch up, recent reports have shown.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story for Amazon, which just recently passed the $2 trillion milestone, and experts expect it will take time for share prices to nearly double. Wedbush\u2019s Ives argued that Amazon\u2019s cloud business, AWS, has also lost out to Microsoft. \u201c\u200b\u200bI think there was some hubris in underestimating what Nadella and Microsoft are doing, and with the crosstown rivals and in that 2-0-6 area code, it's been a bit of a gut punch for Amazon,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd when it comes to AI, Amazon is just \u201cbehind the eightball\u201d too, according to the veteran tech analyst. However, Ives noted that CEO Andy Jassy has made changes to the company\u2019s cloud business, and with a massive base of customers, Amazon should benefit more from AI moving forward.\n\nTo be sure, every tech giant on this list also faces risks. Antitrust regulations, cyber attacks, a slowing economy, and a reduction in AI spending should all be considered. But for now, the bulls remain bullish\u2013and they think you should be too.\n\n\u201cThe tech bears with their spreadsheets and valuations will stay in hibernation mode,\u201d Ives said. \u201cBut when everyone meets for breakfast at 6 am after this AI party. The bulls [will have] won and the bears just sound smart.\u201d",

    "title": "Struggles at Belfast\u2019s Titanic shipyard reflect UK\u2019s faded naval power",
    "body": "The Harland & Wolff (H&W) shipyard in Belfast is famous for having built the Titanic, the largest passenger ship of its time before it hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic. But things have moved on since 1912. In recent weeks Samson, one of the two yellow gantry cranes that dominate Belfast\u2019s skyline, has been straddling a giant oil processing vessel.\n\nThis is the Canadian-owned SeaRose, which is being upgraded by H&W in a contract worth more than \u00a390m. The SeaRose is even larger than the Titanic, weighing in at 150,000 tonnes. The sight of a massive ship in Belfast harbour recalls the city\u2019s glory days as a shipbuilding superpower. H&W collapsed into administration in 2019, but now the shipyard is back at the centre of British hopes to restore something of the industry\u2019s past glories.\n\nThose hopes now appear to be under threat as H&W waits for Keir Starmer\u2019s government to decide whether to proceed with a controversial \u00a31.6bn deal that would see the small, Aim-listed company given a \u00a3200m loan guarantee completely underwritten by the UK taxpayer. It has six months to find new money to replace previous debts.\n\nThe yard\u2019s travails illustrate the gap between the UK\u2019s pretensions to be a major military power and the reality in the industry. For all its Herculean endeavours, H&W is a minnow, valued at only \u00a314.5m before its shares were suspended last week after it failed to file accounts on time.\n\nBritain once had the most powerful navy in the world \u2013 albeit one built to sustain an empire rather than for defence \u2013 and even during the Falklands war in 1982 it could muster 23 destroyers and frigates (it now has 17) plus two aircraft carriers. The days of naval supremacy are long gone, but the UK is still a mid-ranking military power, with a nuclear arsenal, a permanent seat on the UN security council and a pledge to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence.\n\nView image in fullscreen BAE Systems is building Royal Navy frigates in Govan, near Glasgow. Photograph: Iain Masterton/Alamy\n\nIn May, Grant Shapps, who was defence secretary until the general election, hailed a \u201cnew golden age for British shipbuilding\u201d, with six new warships to be built in the UK, with another 22 military vessels already in the pipeline.\n\nMost of the ships will be built by the UK\u2019s two dominant naval shipbuilders, with Type 26 frigates being made by BAE Systems in Govan and Scotstoun near Glasgow, and Type 31 frigates by Babcock International at Rosyth near Edinburgh. BAE also builds submarines for the Royal Navy at Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.\n\nHowever, the programme also includes three \u201cfleet solid support\u201d ships, which carry ammunition and other supplies to aircraft carriers. That \u00a31.6bn contract has been awarded to a consortium of H&W, Spain\u2019s state-owned shipbuilder Navantia, and British design firm BMT. The government said the contract would create 900 shipyard jobs in Belfast, plus another 300 at a yard in Appledore, Devon, bought by H&W\u2019s owner, InfraStrata, in 2020 after it closed in 2019.\n\nMade in Belfast\n\nHundreds of new jobs will provide a huge morale boost for Belfast, but the city will still be a long way from reliving its former glories.\n\nIn the 19th century, Belfast\u2019s growth matched anything seen in England\u2019s northern industrial cities. According to Graham Brownlow, senior lecturer in economics at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, the city\u2019s population rose from 75,000 in 1841 to 387,000 in 1911, and by 1914 H&W had 14,000 employees. This rapid growth was, he says, an early example of what is now known as industrial strategy, with the city\u2019s Harbour Commission reclaiming land to build docks.\n\nJohn Parker, the veteran industrialist who now chairs builder Laing O\u2019Rourke, joined H&W as an apprentice in the late 1950s, when it ran the largest single shipyard in the world, building on 19 slipways at a time.\n\n\u201cIt was just the most massive operation\u201d and \u201can amazing training ground\u201d, said Parker, who went on to become chief executive from 1983-93. Yet from the late 1960s, international competition surged and Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles took a lot of energy out of the city.\n\nThe ship now under the Belfast cranes, the SeaRose, was built in South Korea which, together with China and Japan, dominates global non-military shipbuilding, making 94% of the world\u2019s merchant fleet, according to UN figures.\n\n\u201cThe collapse of UK shipbuilding wasn\u2019t because of a lack of local tonnage being produced,\u201d said Brownlow. \u201cIt was because the share of tonnage was falling as the rest of the world caught up.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen The Samson and Goliath cranes at the Harland & Wolff shipyard.

So any British shipbuilding revival will have to rely on warships \u2013 plus perhaps contracts for maintenance, repairs and upgrades that can be handled by smaller yards.\n\nLabour has promised a strategic defence review within its first year, before it sets its spending priorities. The party has already made some firm commitments on how it will spend the equivalent of 2.5% of GDP on defence, including sticking closely to the Conservatives\u2019 plan to build four new nuclear submarines.\n\nThe review would look in detail at every large contract, including the fleet solid support ships, a party source said. This will take time because security classifications mean opposition politicians, like the general public, see only the bare minimum of information about any defence deal.\n\nNone of that augurs well for the quick turnaround of the H&W loan guarantee expected by chief executive John Wood, who claimed in May on social media that the general election would not delay the deal.\n\nFinancial troubles\n\nView image in fullscreen Harland and Wolff workers protest at the yard\u2019s threatened closure in 2019. Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA\n\nA threatened strike has been called off after the company reached a pay agreement with workers. But if the loan guarantee is not given, H&W could be in trouble.\n\nLast Monday, the company blamed its share suspension on a dispute with auditors over when it could recognise revenues from future years, and released unaudited figures showing it lost \u00a343m in 2022. It also said: \u201cShould there be any material delays to securing the facility post the general election, the company\u2019s ability to execute new and large contracts would be adversely affected.\u201d\n\nThe situation is urgent because H&W is carrying massive liabilities. These include $115m (\u00a391m) in loans agreed from March 2022 with Riverstone Credit Management, a private US lender, which is charging it interest of more than 14% a year. H&W said it had made repayments, and reported debt costs of \u00a318m for 2023. The loan must be repaid by 31 December.\n\nSignificant further delays to the UK loan guarantee would probably eat into the \u00a377m H&W earmarked for capital investments, including new robotic welding machines and an expanded fabrication hall.\n\nRiverstone holds charges over H&W\u2019s key properties, including Appledore, the main shipyard, its leases of smaller yards in Methil and Arnish in Scotland, plus land off Northern Ireland\u2019s coast related to a gas storage project. This means that if H&W defaults on its loans, the yards could fall into the lender\u2019s hands.\n\nAn H&W spokesperson said: \u201cOur number one priority is investing in our yards and people so that we can capitalise on the significant opportunities facing us, including the landmark fleet solid support contract. We have supportive financing partners and are progressing alternative solutions that are better suited to the long-term growth of our business.\n\n\u201cTurnover has increased substantially with the completion of multiple projects and market forecasts are projecting a revenue line of \u00a3200m this financial year.\u201d\n\nWhatever H&W\u2019s fate, its struggles illustrate the difficulty of spreading warship construction work beyond the big Scottish yards. MPs have raised concerns that much of the building may be carried out in Navantia\u2019s yard in C\u00e1diz, Spain, with only superficial work being done in Belfast and north Devon.\n\nTrevor Taylor, professorial fellow at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said he believed it was technically feasible to spread some warship work to other UK yards \u2013 as recommended by Parker in a 2016 report for government \u2013 because modern ships are built in blocks and then joined together.\n\nThe Navy\u2019s two Queen Elizabeth- class aircraft carriers were built in blocks at seven yards across Britain before being floated around the coast for assembly at Rosyth, north of Edinburgh.\n\nHowever, Taylor warned that the political attraction of revitalising Belfast is matched by \u201crisks in delivery\u201d because of the need for funding. If H&W were to drop out, one option would be to bring back the previously rejected consortium led by BAE and Birkenhead\u2019s Cammell Laird shipyard.\n\nBoth Taylor and Parker said the industry had withered to such an extent that companies such as H&W would struggle to build a workforce with the right skills. H&W said this was \u201ccategorically not true\u201d and that it had already increased its workforce from 46 to almost 1,600.\n\nEmma Evans, defence policy adviser at ADS, a lobby group for the UK defence industry, said the government could change a \u201cfeast and famine approach to contracting, which leads to a drain of skills, and makes it very difficult for industry to train, invest, and retain skilled workers\u201d.\n\nFor Parker, the prize of billions of pounds of economic value being spread across the UK is worth it. \u201cThis can be a great source of economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cBelfast certainly needs that type of opportunity to create highly skilled jobs.\u201d\n\nMarine adventures\n\nWhile H&W\u2019s main focus is now on shipbuilding, the company and its chief executive have a history of unorthodox marine projects.\n\nBefore buying the shipyard out of administration in 2019 and taking its famous name, H&W was called InfraStrata. It emerged out of a gas drilling company in 2008, and tried to frack for gas in Northern Ireland (drawing the ire of Avengers-star-cum-campaigner Mark Ruffalo in the process).\n\nIt then pivoted to a project for storing gas in salt caverns at Islandmagee, on Northern Ireland\u2019s east coast. H&W suffered a severe blow last month when Belfast\u2019s court of appeal ruled that government approval of the project had not been lawful. The company said it was considering whether it could take its case to the supreme court.\n\nWood joined InfraStrata in 2018, having previously been a director of MSC Europe, a Southampton ship refitter that collapsed in 2007, reportedly owing suppliers \u00a33m. (The company said that Wood had since then \u201cdelivered multibillion contracts and run businesses delivering major programmes\u201d.) After a stint managing ship repairs at BAE Systems, and then working for consultancies, he led the \u00a33.3m purchase of the Belfast shipyard in December 2019.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Isles of Scilly ferry: H&W is hoping to launch a rival service. Photograph: Alamy\n\nBut aside from building ships, H&W is now involved in a different marine adventure: setting up a rival to the ferry service from Penzance to the Isles of Scilly, a 28-mile crossing in often-rough seas.\n\nThe project has been hit by delays in procuring a usable vessel. The company had planned to build the ferry in Appledore, and put in a bid for government levelling-up funding. It abandoned that idea and sourced a boat from Spain instead. It has blamed heavy rain at the dry dock in Portsmouth for delays to a yellow paint job on the new ferry, which to be called the Atlantic Wolff.\n\nThe company is taking bookings, but customers have said these are being fulfilled by a 12-passenger rigid inflatable boat, and in some cases a helicopter.\n\nComplaints on social media tell of a lack of communication from Scilly Ferries about when the ferry will be in service, after it missed promises to start by June, and then by \u201cmid-June\u201d. H&W it is \u201ccommitting maximum resources, seven days a week\u201d but added that it was still working on \u201csome important regulatory issues\u201d, including a crucial passenger certificate from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.",

    "body": "The first moves of a new prime minister can have lasting consequences. When Clement Attlee went from being wartime deputy prime minister to Labour prime minister in 1945, he had little alternative but to offer the nation the peacetime equivalent of Churchill\u2019s blood, toil, tears and sweat.\n\nThe age of austerity was born as the UK rebuilt its wartorn economy. Shortages necessarily involved rationing until a fully fledged peacetime economy could be restored. The contrast with the Conservative-Liberal Democrat policy of austerity from 2010 onwards could hardly have been starker.\n\nPost-2010 austerity, championed in particular by the then chancellor, George Osborne, was founded on a false economic premise, and on a rightwing approach to cutting back on previous rates of growth of public services in favour of tax cuts. The false premise was that the financial crisis and rise in the budget deficit had been caused by Labour\u2019s putative overspending, whereas the culprit had been the banking \u00adcrisis. Absurd comparisons were made with the plight of the Greek economy, which was in much more serious trouble. These were made the justification for austerity.\n\nLast week\u2019s election result was in part the electorate\u2019s reaction to the cumulative impact of the austerity programme. Austerity seems to have been a slow burner, but by the time the hapless Rishi Sunak called what turned out to be a historic election, one could hardly move without being told that the country was broken, and nothing worked.\n\nThe examples that have stoked public anger are legion: the strains on the NHS, the state of the railways, the overcrowded prisons, the pollution of the rivers caused by the privatised water companies, soaring poverty necessitating food banks \u2013 you name it, there are many reasons why people expressed their frustration.\n\nIn the run-up to last Thursday, Keir Starmer had several field days rubbing in the Conservatives\u2019 disgraceful record. But he spent precious little time on what should be done about the Brexit horrors which were superimposed on an economy already suffering from austerity.\n\nI come back to my opening line, and the lasting consequences of early action, or inaction, by new prime ministers. A classic example of inaction with deleterious consequences came in 1964, when the newly elected Harold Wilson overruled his advisers and resisted their calls to devalue a patently overvalued pound. The misalignment of the currency was hampering the export drive; a series of sterling crises forced resort to deflationary measures which did no good to the government\u2019s growth plans. Eventually, devaluation was forced by the markets on a reluctant Wilson in 1967.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His equivalent of the devaluation error is a decision which is likely to inhibit his growth plans, with echoes of Wilson in 1964. In this case, however, it was not his first major economic decision in government. No: he took it last week, from what we might call a poll position which more or less guaranteed that he would be in government within a few days.\n\nAlthough Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had several times been dismissive about rejoining the single market and customs union, many pro-Europeans were hoping that this merely reflected Starmer\u2019s fear of upsetting so-called red wall voters who had deserted Labour last time. After all, the press \u2013 especially the rightwing press \u2013 has been replete in recent months with examples of Starmer changing his mind.\n\nBut last week, the now prime minister dug in his heels, saying he was ruling out rejoining the European single market in his lifetime: \u201cI\u2019ve been really clear about not rejoining the EU, the single market or the customs union or a return to freedom of movement.\u201d\n\nThis at a time when the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe has concluded that Labour\u2019s existing plans to improve our trading relationship with Europe will have \u201cminimal\u201d impact on reducing the huge and mounting costs of Brexit. And when the same thinktank finds that 78% \u2013 repeat, 78% \u2013 of Labour \u00advoters say they would vote for a return to the EU!\n\nIn Labour\u2019s manifesto, the party commits itself to tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade. If ever there were an unnecessary barrier to trade, it is surely our exclusion from the European Union.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. The above is intended to be constructive \u00adcriticism. I admire Starmer and happily join the chorus in \u00admarvelling at his achievement in making the Labour party electable in such a short time. This succession of dreadful Conservative governments was crying out for its comeuppance.\n\nBut Starmer has got to get his act together over the EU. Not in his lifetime? In 1988, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that he did not expect German unification in his lifetime. Two years later, Germany was reunified.",

    "title": "QQQI: Opportunistic Way To Access Double Digit Yield Without Losing Upside Potential",
    "body": "Torsten Asmus\n\nNEOS NASDAQ-100(R) High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) is an actively managed ETF focusing on the Nasdaq 100 companies against which the ETF managers sell and in some instances also buy call options to generate abnormal income.\n\nQQQI is a relatively recently established ETF (end of January this year), hence its assets under management figure is quite small - just around $330 million. In addition to this, there is no long history available for QQQI that we could factor into our assessment.\n\nIf we look at how QQQI has performed since its inception, we will notice two interesting dynamics that are reflected in the chart below.\n\nYcharts\n\nFirst, while QQQI has delivered strong double-digit total return performance, it has still lagged behind the pure play Nasdaq 100 index. This is only logical given that the ETF employs some covered calls to enhance its yield level, which, in turn, comes at a cost of foregone upside potential.\n\nSecond, if we isolate the return data from the distributed income streams, we will notice that QQQI has still managed to register positive price appreciation at around 6%. This is a rather significant level compared to what other covered call ETFs typically record in their price performances (i.e., usually the ETF level remains flat and the lion's share of the returns are explained only by the distributed income avenue).\n\nWith this in mind, let me explain why I am bullish on QQQI.\n\nThesis\n\nThere are three fundamental reasons why I am bullish here.\n\nThe first is related to the current yield level, which is very attractive, as one might expect from yield-focused ETF structures. The thing with QQQI is that if we look at the TTM dividend yield level, we will arrive at a yield of circa 5.8%. This is not a correct way to interpret this as such calculus is based on the past twelve months from which in five QQQI was operational. So, if we correct for this aspect and annualize the distribution levels received over the past 5-month period, we will get a yield that is closer to 15%. In fact, I would argue that such math underestimates the dividend growth potential as it is quite clear that in those 5 distribution data points there is a clear momentum in distributing gradually increasing current income streams.\n\nSo, a yield at this is level could be easily deemed as one of the highest in the option driven ETF space, where the vehicle is structured so that the underlying portfolio is not synthetically created.\n\nThis leads us to the second reason why, in my view, QQQI is an attractive choice. The reason lies in the fact that, while QQQI is an option driven ETF with a goal to capture abnormal income streams, it does not stick only to covered call option strategy, which inherently puts a massive cap on the upside potential. Instead, QQQI employs an active or dynamic option strategy, which could also include a presence of both buying and selling options against the underlying index (i.e., the Nasdaq 100). In this way, investors can also (potentially) participate in the upside movements of the Nasdaq 100 without losing the attractive income component - just as we can observe it in the chart above.\n\nAnother source of a magnified income is the process how QQQI takes advantage of tax loss harvesting by trading the NDX Index options, which are classified as section 1256 contract (these are the contracts that are subject to lower tax rate regime). As a result of this, investors can access high yield that is also partially driven higher by more favorable taxation.\n\nThe third reason relates to the depressed volatility levels or the VIX. As for any ETF, which seeks to generate abnormal yield from option strategies, higher volatility levels come in handy to really access attractive income. This is especially true for ETFs that mostly rely on selling options to pocket the premiums that could be then distributed as income without having to sell the underlying assets.\n\nHowever, as we can see in the chart below, the VIX is currently at rather depressed levels, which should per definition imply cheaper call options.\n\nYcharts\n\nEven with such headwinds in place, QQQI is still able to generate close to 15% in income. In case the VIX shot higher and remains there for some time, it is extremely likely that QQQI would be able to accommodate more enticing current income streams. In my opinion, this is an embedded potential in QQQI to eventually benefit from rising VIX, and thus becoming an even higher yielding ETF alternative.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe essence of investing in QQQI lies in the combination of accessing abnormal yield in conjunction with some price appreciation potential that stems from the dynamically managed option strategy. At the same time, by investing in QQQI, investors effectively can go long the underlying index (the Nasdaq 100), which is comprised of high growth names, thus offering incremental returns from the partially opened upside risk. In addition, we have to also keep in mind that the VIX is currently at rather depressed levels, and even despite this, QQQI is able to accommodate close to 15% in yield.\n\nIn my humble opinion, it is worth considering adding QQQI into the portfolio to enhance the yield and / or complement the income-seeking ETF share.",

    "body": "PM Images\n\nThis article series aims at evaluating ETFs (exchange-traded funds) regarding past performance and portfolio metrics. Reviews with updated data are posted when necessary.\n\nUSMV strategy\n\niShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF (BATS:USMV) was launched on 10/18/2011 and tracks the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USD) Index. It has a portfolio of 170 stocks, a 30-day SEC yield of 1.72% and a total expense ratio of 0.15%. Distributions are paid quarterly. The fund\u2019s objective is a lower volatility relative to the broad U.S. equity market. USMV doesn\u2019t focus on low-vol stocks like most low-volatility ETFs, but it uses sophisticated mathematical tools to optimize a portfolio with a low aggregate volatility.\n\nAs described by MSCI, the underlying index is optimized from the MSCI USA Index to obtain a lower beta, volatility and capitalization bias, with a preference for stocks with low idiosyncratic risk. This process makes use of Barra Optimizer software library to \u201cproduce an index that has the lowest absolute volatility for a given set of constraints,\u201d based on an estimated security co-variance matrix. Among the constraints, constituent weights are capped at 1.5% and sector weights must not deviate more than 5% from the parent index. The underlying index is reconstituted twice a year at the end of May and November. The portfolio turnover rate in the most recent fiscal year was 23%. This article will use as a benchmark the Russell 1000 index, represented by iShares Russell 1000 ETF (IWB).\n\nPortfolio\n\nThe fund has about 68% of asset value in large and mega cap companies, and the rest in mid-caps. The heaviest sector is technology (26.3%), although it is less overweight than in the benchmark (31.6%). It is followed by healthcare (17%), financials (16.3%) and consumer staples (10.3%). Compared to the Russell 1000, USMV overweights financials and traditional defensive sectors: utilities, consumer staples and healthcare. It underweights mostly consumer discretionary, communication, materials and ignores real estate.\n\nUSMV sector breakdown in % of assets (Chart: author; data: iShares)\n\nThe top 10 holdings, listed below with some fundamental ratios, represent 15.7% of asset value and the heaviest position weighs 1.67%.

Nonetheless, this methodology also results in overweighting traditional defensive sectors relative to the benchmark. The current portfolio looks superior to the Russell 1000 index regarding value and quality, but inferior in growth. USMV has lagged the benchmark in total return since inception, but it is marginally better in risk-adjusted performance. It has also lagged several low-vol ETFs over the last 8 years, especially Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF, whose low-volatility approach includes earnings in addition to price.

    "body": "hapabapa\n\nIntroduction\n\nBloomberg hit the nail on the head when it wrote: \"High-Priced S&P 500 Powers Head Untroubled by Political Stress.\"\n\nEssentially, the market went back to doing what it does best, which is betting on the Fed easing rates going forward. This allowed it to ignore poor employment numbers, construction in the services industry, and weakness in manufacturing sentiment.\n\nThe S&P 500 gained 2% in the week, the most since April, as data showing a contraction in services industries and an uptick in the unemployment rate reinforced optimism on rate cuts. Ten-year Treasury yields, which initially spiked after Biden\u2019s disastrous June 27 performance spurred wagers that Trump\u2019s return to office would herald looser fiscal policy, erased the increase, as did the dollar, falling for the first week since May. - Bloomberg\n\nBloomberg\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not \"hating.\" I know I may sound incredibly bearish when I write stuff like this.\n\nI don't have any shorts. In fact, I don't even have cash after my latest investment.\n\nThis is all about the risk/reward.\n\nAlthough we can make the case that stock market valuations are horrible tools for market timing, the current situation hints that we may need to lower our expectations, regardless of what happens in November (or in general).\n\nCurrently, the S&P 500 trades at 26x earnings, which is higher than any election since at least 1990.\n\nBloomberg\n\nAgain, this doesn't mean the market is toast - especially not because these valuations are driven by fewer than ten mega-cap \"tech\" stocks.\n\nWhat this means is that I'm looking for opportunities elsewhere, which includes other areas with secular growth and companies that haven't done so well recently.\n\nOne of them is Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). The medical devices giant with a $180 billion market cap has been disappointing since its stock price peak in 4Q21. Back then, the pandemic ended, leaving COVID-19 winners in the dust.\n\nWhile weakness is deserved after the valuation started to run red-hot, I have become a big believer in the potential this Dividend King brings to the table.\n\nMy most recent article was written on April 22, when I went with the title: \"Why I Believe Abbott Is Much Better Positioned In Today's Rising Inflation Scenario.\"\n\nSince then, shares are down 3.2%, lagging the 11.6% return of the S&P 500 by a substantial margin. It has also allowed the S&P 500 to beat ABT over the past ten years. Including dividends, it has beaten the healthcare giant by exactly 34 points.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAs we slowly approach the company's earnings release on July 18, I'll use this article to update my thesis and explain why I like the value ABT brings to the table.\n\nSo, let's get to it!\n\nForget COVID, Abbott Is Back\n\nI say this with the utmost respect for people who suffered from the pandemic, but it was one of the most bullish periods for healthcare companies like Abbott, who sold hundreds of millions of tests and related products.\n\nGoogle News (2020)\n\nThe problem is that it pushed so much money into the industry that it took many years to unwind all of the \"bullishness.\"\n\nFor example, the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI), which returned 223% over the past ten years (excluding dividends), hasn't gone anywhere since January 2021!\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThis has created an extremely tough situation for investors, as it's hard to deal with an industry that goes from sky-high growth to contraction, followed by an uncertain path of growth. That really does a number on our ability to find appropriate P/E multiples.\n\nThe good news is that 2024 seems to be the first year of elevated optimism.\n\nFor example, in the first quarter, the company raised its full-year guidance, expecting adjusted EPS between $4.55 and $4.70. It expects organic sales growth, excluding COVID-19 testing, of 8.5% to 10.0%.\n\nAbbott Laboratories\n\nThis was driven by strong underlying growth, including the achievement of ex-COVID double-digit organic sales growth for the fifth consecutive quarter, with a 14% growth rate in Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceuticals.\n\nWhat makes ABT so powerful is diversification and its ability to innovate in each of its key segments.\n\nThis includes the news that it obtained product approvals and has seen major milestones in critical clinical trials in a number of key areas.\n\nFor example, in Diagnostics, Abbott received FDA approval for a point-of-care diagnostic test that can determine if someone suffered a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in just 15 minutes, run on its i-STAT Alinity product.\n\nAbbott Laboratories\n\nAs we can see below, the Diagnostics segment was the only segment with a negative impact from COVID-19. I highlighted organic growth and non-COVID organic growth in the table below.\n\nAbbott Laboratories\n\nMoreover, the company has seen 8% higher sales in its Nutrition segment, driven by double-digit growth in Pediatric Nutrition and market share gains in the U.S. infant formula business.\n\nOn top of that, the launch of Protality, which is a new nutritional shake aimed at adults pursuing weight loss, is expected to further support growth in this segment.\n\nOn a side note, this makes Abbott a winner of the current weight-loss pill trend, as its products go well with other weight-loss treatments.\n\nMeanwhile, in Diabetes Care, FreeStyle Libre sales reached $1.5 billion in the quarter. This translates to a 23% growth rate!\n\nAbbott Laboratories\n\nFreeStyle Libre also benefited from the expansion of reimbursement coverage in major European markets like France and Germany.\n\nThe company is also rapidly growing in heart health, which is one of my favorite areas due to heart issues being the number one death cause.\n\nUsing 2019 numbers (old but still relevant), a third of all deaths came from heart-related issues.\n\nOur World In Data\n\nIn Structural Heart, the company saw a 13% growth rate. This was supported by products like Navitor, Amulet, and TriClip.\n\nMoreover, the recent FDA approval of TriClip, which is designed for treating tricuspid regurgitation, supports the company's ability to address major demand in another fast-growing market.\n\nAbbott Laboratories\n\nLast but not least, the company saw 17% growth in Neuromodulation, supported by the launch of Eterna and Liberta, which are devices for pain management and movement disorders (like Parkinson's) - also two important growth markets.\n\nWhere's The Shareholder Value?\n\nOne major benefit of owning ABT stock is its fantastic dividend.\n\nFor starters, Abbott Laboratories is a Dividend King, which means it has hiked its dividends for more than 50 consecutive years. Please note that the dividend decline in 2013 was the AbbVie (ABBV) spin-off. Since then, both ABT and ABBV have raised their dividends every single year.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThat said, a Dividend King title is great, but it's not enough.\n\nAfter all, when a company is mature enough to gain Dividend King status, sometimes it's so mature that dividend growth is slow. Hence, while I respect Dividend Kings, it's not a criterion I'm aiming for in my research.\n\nLuckily, ABT is different. It's a Dividend King that comes with a lot of dividend growth.\n\nYielding 2.1%, the company has a 48% payout ratio and a five-year CAGR of 12.1%, which is a great deal for at least two reasons:\n\nA 2.1% yield with double-digit dividend growth is a great combination. We can expect elevated dividend growth to last, as analysts are very upbeat about ABT's future.\n\nAfter what we discussed in this article so far, it may not be a surprise that analysts are upbeat.\n\nUsing the FactSet data in the chart below, analysts expect 4% EPS growth this year (including pandemic headwinds). 2025 and 2026 are both expected to see 11% growth.\n\nFAST Graphs\n\nAs I have written in prior articles, I believe this recovery deserves a higher multiple than its long-term 19.8x average.\n\nLooking at prior growth recoveries, the company used to trade at 24-25x earnings.\n\nUsing that number would pave the road for 12-14% annual returns in the years ahead.\n\nThat said, I don't own Abbott. While I was looking to add it to my portfolio, I bought too many new positions this year to justify adding another one - at least for the next few months.\n\nInstead, I decided to focus on my investment in Danaher (DHR), which has a very high correlation to ABT. So, don't be surprised I'm not long ABT despite my bullish thesis.\n\nTakeaway\n\nI believe Abbott Laboratories presents a compelling opportunity due to its strong fundamentals and diversified growth across various segments.\n\nWith significant advancements in diagnostics, nutrition, diabetes care, and heart health, Abbott's impressive dividend growth track record and innovative capabilities make it a solid long-term investment.\n\nIn its 2Q24 earnings call, I expect the company to shed more light on innovation and its ability to move beyond the challenging post-pandemic environment.\n\nWhile I currently don't hold Abbott stock, its potential for double-digit returns in the coming years makes it a fantastic long-term play.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros:\n\nDiversified Growth : Abbott excels in multiple segments, including diagnostics, nutrition, diabetes care, and heart health, which provides it with diversification and elevated growth.\n\n: Abbott excels in multiple segments, including diagnostics, nutrition, diabetes care, and heart health, which provides it with diversification and elevated growth. Strong Dividend : As a Dividend King with a 2.1% yield and a five-year CAGR of 12.1%, Abbott offers reliable and growing income.\n\n: As a Dividend King with a 2.1% yield and a five-year CAGR of 12.1%, Abbott offers reliable and growing income.

    "title": "Kinross Gold: The Impressive Operational Performance Continues (NYSE:KGC)",
    "body": "Bjoern Wylezich/iStock via Getty Images\n\nOverview\n\nKinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) is a large gold mining company that is guiding for a gold equivalent production of 2.1Moz in 2024, which is roughly in-line with what the company has produced over the last couple of years. I have covered Kinross a couple of times per year since 2022 and the prior articles on the company can be found here.\n\nFigure 1 - Source: Annual Reports\n\nThe company has much of its production coming from North and South America nowadays, but a substantial amount of earnings and cash flows still comes from the low-cost Tasiast mine in Mauritania. Overall, it is a relatively well-diversified gold mining company.\n\nFigure 2 - Source: Kinross Presentation\n\nThe stock price of Kinross is this year up 41%, outperforming the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) by a decent margin, and most peers. The strong gold price has naturally been a tailwind for the company, but the strong operational performance has also been a significant factor. The company delivered a good Q1 result.\n\nFigure 3 - Source: Koyfin\n\nOperations\n\nFigure 4 - Source: Kinross Quarterly Reports\n\nIn the above chart, we can see the gold equivalent production and costs on a consolidated level over the last couple of years for Kinross. The production volume has increased slightly compared to a couple of years ago and main contributing factor to the production increase, is the ramp up of La Coipa in Chile. The all-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") has also been relatively flat lately, which is better than many peers.\n\nLa Coipa did in the most recent quarter have a gold equivalent production of 71Koz together with a very competitive production cost of $733/oz. That is up from effectively no production in Q1 2022. So, it is fair to say La Coipa has been a very welcomed addition to Kinross' portfolio of producing assets.\n\nFigure 5 - Source: Kinross Quarterly Reports Figure 6 - Source: Kinross Quarterly Reports\n\nWith that said, Paracatu in Brazil and Tasiast in Maurtania are the two largest and most important producing assets for Kinross. The Q1 2024 gold equivalent production for the two assets were 128Koz for Paracatu and 159Koz for Tasiast.\n\nThe production cost was $1,059/oz for Paracatu in Q1 and costs will be slightly elevated for Paracatu during 2024 due to planned mine sequencing, but the cost should come back down in 2025. The production cost was $660/oz at Tasiast, which has both the highest production volume and lowest production cost among the assets, so it accounts for a disproportionate percentage of the consolidated earnings and cash flows.\n\nThe three remaining producing assets in the U.S. are slightly smaller and the production costs are also higher. However, they have, like most assets of Kinross performed reasonably well lately. The production costs have decreased some at Round Mountain and Bald Mountain over the last couple of quarters.\n\nFigure 7 - Source: Kinross Quarterly Reports\n\nProduction was lower in the most recent quarter at Fort Know and the production cost has ticked up slightly over the last couple of quarters. However, the processing plant will see a substantial boost to the production volume when the ore from the Manh Choh project starts to get processed at Fort Know, which is on track for first production in early Q3 2024. This will be a welcomed near-term catalyst for Kinross.\n\nThere is also a resource update and a preliminary economic assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) due to be released on Great Bear during the second half of 2024. While we can likely expect Great Bear to continue to grow for some time due to the ongoing drilling, the PEA will provide some more accurate initial estimates on what Great Bear can be valued at.\n\nPeer Comparison\n\nIn the chart below, we can see the forward-looking Price to Earnings and EV to EBITDA ratios over the last few years. A couple of years ago, the valuation multiples were much cheaper for Kinross, both on an absolute level, but also compared to peers.\n\nFigure 8 - Source: Koyfin\n\nThe valuation multiples for Kinross are now more in the middle of the range. Some of the companies in the chart below have more jurisdictional risk, which probably justifies a lower valuation. Alamos Gold (AGI) and Agnico Eagle (AEM) have slightly higher valuation multiples, which is also makes sense given the lower operating costs and less jurisdictional risk. So, that Kinross today is somewhere in the middle of the ranges, seems fair.\n\nWith that said, Kinross still has slightly more financial leverage than most of its peers, even if the company has deleveraged some over the last couple of years. So, there is more balance sheet risk with Kinross than most of the peers, but the absolute level of financial leverage isn't at an alarming level.\n\nFigure 9 - Source: Koyfin\n\nConclusion\n\nKinross has some high-quality assets, which have performed very well lately, so the management team has done great job. The company also has an interesting near-term catalyst with the Manh Choh project and the potential of Great Bear makes Kinross a very interesting long-term investment as well.\n\nFigure 10 - Source: Kinross Presentation\n\nWith that said, the stock price performance of Kinross has been strong and the company feels relatively fairly valued at this point. So, I am neutral on the stock here. I last bought Kinross in mid-2022, when the stock was really out of favor. I am today more focused on emerging producers and developers, where some high-quality companies are still trading at more depressed levels.",

    "title": "Why Arm Holdings Stock Soared 36% Last Month",
    "body": "Shares of Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) rose by 35.8% in June 2024, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The jump continued a broad uptrend for the semiconductor technology expert, adding up to a 117.7% gain in the first half of the year.\n\nArm's gains are driven by the ongoing frenzy for advanced artificial intelligence (AI) software and the hardware that makes those apps tick. And Arm investors are also paying close attention to the global and American economies.\n\nAnalyst ratings and economic trends\n\nThe enthusiasm for AI technologies has significantly boosted investor interest in companies involved in AI hardware. While the AI success of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) doesn't directly lean on ARM architectures -- they primarily use their proprietary platforms instead -- Arm benefits indirectly from the AI boom. The positive market sentiment toward AI advancements continues to propel Arm's stock upwards. Furthermore, the company's former focus on low-power embedded and mobile chips is changing before your eyes. These days, you'll find Arm-based chips all over modern data centers and PC systems.\n\nArm's stock received notable boosts from several analyst upgrades in June. At least two leading analyst firms raised their target prices on Arm stock last month, citing strong revenue growth and potential market share gains against the likes of Nvidia and AMD. These bullish endorsements reinforced investor confidence in Arm's growth prospects, resulting in mild price gains along the way.\n\nThe broader market dynamics also played a role in Arm's June rise. A softer-than-expected jobs report in May fueled hopes for potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which would benefit growth stocks. The semiconductor sector is full of growth stories, including Arm. This positive macroeconomic backdrop created a helpful environment for Arm's stock to flourish.\n\nStrategic industry developments\n\nIndustry news also contributed to Arm's strong performance. Reports that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) was investing in extreme ultraviolet lithography suggested a robust demand for next-generation chip technologies. As TSMC is a leading manufacturer of Arm-based chips, this investment indicated a positive outlook for Arm's future growth.\n\nArm's strategic positioning in the AI ecosystem highlights its potential for sustained growth. The company's advanced v9 architecture and its power-efficient processor platforms are increasingly interesting to major industry players, strengthening Arm's competitive edge in the semiconductor market.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Arm also earned a rare market accolade last month. The stock was added to the Nasdaq-100 Index on June 24. This prestigious index, which informs the popular Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) and other Nasdaq-tracking exchange-traded funds, comprises the top 100 largest and most actively traded companies on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nArm's rapid inclusion in the index after an initial public offering last September reminds investors of its growing importance in the global technology ecosystem. As CEO Rene Haas highlighted in that announcement, this achievement validates Arm's business strategy and its critical role in providing foundational compute solutions for AI workloads.\n\nWatch Arm's stock closely, but hold off on buying it\n\nThe stock isn't cheap these days. Whether you measure the valuation by price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, or price-to-free cash flow ratios, Arm's stock almost always makes Nvidia and AMD look affordable by comparison. In other words, Arm isn't a value investor's favorite AI pick. Even die-hard growth investors might want to take it easy with this red-hot stock at the moment. In my eyes, Arm is the kind of AI stock that could serve your portfolio well in the long run -- from a lower starting price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Why Nike Stock Lost 21% Last Month",
    "body": "Shares of Nike (NYSE: NKE) fell 20.7% in June 2024, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The athletic apparel and footwear giant was doing fine until the very last market day of the month, where a disappointing earnings report resulted in a single-day price drop of 17.8%.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings reveal hidden challenges for Nike\n\nAt first glance, Nike's fourth-quarter results didn't look terrible. Currency-adjusted revenues came in at $12.6 billion, 2% below the year-ago period's figure. Adjusted earnings of $1.01 per share represented a 53% year-over-year jump. Your average analyst firm was looking for earnings of roughly $0.85 per share on sales near $12.9 billion, so the report was a mixed bag with a slight revenue miss but a large bottom-line surprise.\n\nBut the headline numbers don't tell the whole story.\n\nNike experienced an 18% revenue drop for the Converse brand and an 8% slide in Nike Direct e-commerce sales. The digital weakness extended to the Greater China market, which otherwise provided a bright spot with a 7% total revenue gain.\n\nAnd the bad news didn't stop there. Nike's first-quarter guidance pointed to a 10% revenue drop due to continued Nike Direct weakness and \"aggressive\" changes to the classic footwear portfolio.\n\nDoes Nike's strategic timing make sense?\n\nThe summer of 2024 should have been a golden moment for Nike, as the upcoming Paris Olympics should amplify the company's marketing efforts. But the Chinese sales surge is slowing down, currency conversion trends don't look helpful, and the e-commerce operation isn't a star performer these days.\n\nSome of the softness is to be expected, since Nike is revamping its product portfolio in a big way. But that doesn't excuse the Nike Direct weakness, and maybe the company shouldn't have launched a product makeover project in a summer Olympics year. The biggest non-annual sporting events of 2025 are limited to rugby, regional soccer championships, and two multi-sport events focusing on non-Olympic sports. These athletes deserve tons of respect, but they aren't revenue boosters for Nike like the FIFA World Cup or summer Olympics tend to be.\n\nBut what's done is done and there's no going back on these decisions. Where is Nike going from here, though?\n\nYou could see 2024 as a rebuilding year, setting Nike up for greater achievements in the future. The revitalized product lineup should be ready to roll alongside the 2026 World Cup, and the global economy may have stabilized by then. Since Nike's stock now trades at prices not seen since the early COVID-19 crash in March 2020, this could be a great time to pick up a shares of a quality company on the cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen again, this year's questionable decision-making makes me suspect that Nike's management could continue to make mistakes, and two years is a long time in the fickle consumer market. And the weak e-commerce operation doesn't inspire trust in Nike's C-suite team, either.\n\nSo if you're willing to bet on a comeback for this legendary brand, please keep that investment rather modest. This isn't a bet-the-farm or -back-up-the-truck opportunity to take advantage of an obvious stock market error, but a risky bet on a stumbling giant.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nike wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $771,034!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

    "title": "Why Oracle Stock Gained 20.5% in June",
    "body": "Shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) rose 20.5% in June 2024, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The database software veteran posted mixed fourth-quarter results on June 11, but that announcement also included other market-moving news. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform has gained a game-changing customer in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\n\nEarnings report and OpenAI partnership\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, Oracle reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.63 on sales of $14.3 billion. Your average Wall Street analyst was looking for earnings near $1.53 per share on sales in the neighborhood of $14.6 billion.\n\nOracle investors largely shrugged off that mixed bag of year-end results to focus on a different tidbit in the same report. CEO Safra Katz noted that the OCI platform will play a role in training OpenAI's ChatGPT systems from now on.\n\n\"Like many others, OpenAI chose OCI because it is the world's fastest and most cost-effective AI infrastructure,\" Katz said on the earnings call. \"Everyone's going to be training their models on imaging. That's a huge amount of additional data, it's a huge amount of additional training, and we're right in the middle of it.\"\n\nIn a quarter with more than 30 AI-related enterprise contracts, this one turned investor heads and moved stock prices. Oracle's stock gained 13.3% the next day.\n\nOracle's future outlook\n\nFollowing the earnings report and the announcement of the partnership with OpenAI, several analysts raised their price targets for Oracle stock. Firms cited the OpenAI deal, the cloud platform's soaring sales, and management's willingness to make heavy investments in the AI-focused infrastructure.\n\nIn total, Oracle shares gained 149% in the first half of 2024. The sleepy enterprise software giant has found new life in the AI market. While the stock isn't exactly cheap, trading at 39 times earnings and 7.5 times sales, these valuation ratios look quite affordable next to high-priced AI-industry peers such as Nvidia or Microsoft. For price-sensitive investors with a hungry eye on the AI sector, Oracle's renewed vigor in the booming space offers a compelling mix of growth potential and reasonable value.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

Despite a planned comeback narrative, private doubts among his inner circle and public polling indicated a loss of confidence in his presidential capabilities.\n\nThe president's subsequent low-profile approach, including teleprompter-reliant appearances and minimal public commentary, failed to address the concerns directly.\n\nThe internal turmoil within the Democratic Party became more apparent as independent strategists began to develop plans to bolster Vice President Harris. Alarmed advisers and staff voiced their concerns about the \"deafening silence\" from the president, while elected and former leaders openly questioned his ability to continue in the race.\n\nBiden's late response to the unfolding situation, including a declaration of self-confidence and a dismissal of polls, did little to stem the tide of skepticism.\n\nThe debate mishaps and subsequent fallout have drawn scrutiny to Biden's campaign strategy and his physical capability to endure the rigors of a presidential race.\n\nThe president's late arrival to the CNN studio, lack of preparation for key camera angles, and faltering responses during the debate have only intensified the scrutiny.\n\nAllies and donors expressed disappointment at his brief and soft-spoken appearances at fundraising events, further fueling doubts about his stamina and communication skills.\n\nWith the House set to return to session on Monday, Senator Mark R.

    "body": "Analysts have underestimated this bull market at every turn, Alpine Macro strategists said in a recent note. Despite widespread skepticism, the global investment firm believes equities are poised to continue surpassing expectations, driven by broadening earnings growth and a resilient economy.\n\nAt the midpoint of the year, the is trading higher than the top price targets set by Wall Street strategists heading into 2024. This bullish trend points to a significant disconnect between market performance and analyst predictions, with strategist targets being the furthest below actual price levels on record in recent quarters. Fund flows have mirrored this miscalculation, with investors remaining underexposed to equities during this rally.\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the misunderstanding of this bull market, according to Alpine Macro. Firstly, the much-anticipated recession has yet to materialize.\n\n\u201cThere has been a slowdown, consistent with tightening financial conditions, but it\u2019s morphed into a rolling profit recession across some sectors as opposed to a broader decline,\u201d strategists wrote.\n\nIn addition, mega tech companies have emerged as an idiosyncratic block, less vulnerable to macro influences, allowing the broader large-cap U.S. equity index to power ahead.\n\nThanks to these developments, corporate earnings have accelerated and topped expectations. The secular tailwinds propelling mega tech have attracted global capital, boosting aggregate valuations.\n\nThe emergence of companies demonstrating record levels of quality, profitability, and visible growth is a significant feature of the U.S. large-cap equity market. These companies are largely insulated from the traditional business cycle, being more closely tied to the adoption cycle of ubiquitous technologies.\n\n\u201cTheir asset-lite characteristics also make them more immune to interest-rate policy,\u201d the firm noted.\n\n\u201cIn a period of unusually high uncertainty, we find it reasonable for most elements of Mega Tech to achieve large valuation premiums as investors prioritize visible sources of quality growth,\u201d it added.\n\nThe current bull market is further fueled by the broadening of earnings growth. Sectors that have managed through rolling recessions are now set to enjoy stabilizing revenues and expanding profit margins.\n\nHistorical trends suggest profit margins bounce back soon after major cycle troughs, hinting at more upside to come.\n\n\"Our corporate earnings model projects earnings of approximately $59 in Q2, and closer to $240 on an annualized basis,\" the report states. \u201cThe bottom-up estimate, which aggregates earnings data for each company, points to an even better outlook closer to $250 for this year.\u201d\n\nAlpine Macro strategists said an aggressive bull thesis for equities includes a potential \"catch-up\" move in valuations for the broader market, aligning it with the high valuations enjoyed by Mega Cap leaders.\n\nThey illustrate the trajectory of the S&P 500 if the rest of the market experienced the same degree of expansion as the Magnificent 7 since 2023. If this catch-up were to occur, the implied value of the S&P 500 would be closer to 6,500 rather than its current level.\n\n\"Of course, this is a stretched assumption,\" they caution.\n\nTheir fair-value valuation model, which incorporates a variety of fundamental and cross-asset inputs, suggests a fair-value price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 20x. Applying this valuation across the entire index would imply a price level of 5,200. However, applying this multiple to the rest of the index while keeping Mega Tech valuations constant would produce a price level of 5,700.\n\n\"Given our expectation for the trajectory of earnings growth, we find this to be a reasonable intermediate target,\" the strategists conclude.",

    "body": "Investing.com -- The first half of 2024 was marked by an artificial intelligence-driven jump in stock markets, volatility in bond yields, and political uncertainty, according to analysts at UBS.\n\nSo what does the third quarter have in store for investors? In a note to clients on July 1, the analysts outlined several key themes they will be focusing on during the current three-month period.\n\nFirst, they said that while they believe the momentum of the AI boom will remain strong in the coming months, many are wondering about the staying power of a tailwind that has lifted a relatively small number of stocks related to the nascent technology.\n\nPart of this worry, they added, stems from a recent dip in shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) after the AI-poster child touched a record high level and briefly became the world's most valuable company by market capitalization in June.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, the analysts said the AI segment \"currently offers the best mix of attractive and visible earnings growth profiles, strong competitive positioning, and a reinvestment runway.\" As a result, they are particularly bullish on semiconductor firms.\n\nOutside of AI, the analysts also predicted that the Federal Reserve will likely begin to ratchet down rates in the second half of 2024.\n\nMinutes released earlier this week from the Fed's June policy gathering showed that officials were reticient to begin to slashing interest rates down from a more than two-decade high range of 5.25% to 5.5% until they had seen more evidence of waning inflation. However, the analysts argued that data on both inflation and economic activity \"have been supportive of a loosening in financial conditions.\"\n\nThey are predicting that the Fed will roll out two rate cuts this year, with the first in September.\n\nIn terms of specific asset classes, the analysts added that they view gold as a hedge against ongoing geopolitical tensions and \"election-related fears around factors like Fed independence.\"\n\nThey projected that gold prices will rise to $2,600 per ounce by the end of the year and $2,700 an ounce by mid-2025. was trading at $2,364.07 per ounce at 06:48 EST (10:48 GMT) on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, they said there is now an \"attractive entry point\" for investors looking to move into fixed income from cash prior to an expected decline in yields stemming from the Fed's anticipated rate cuts.\n\n\"If the Fed pivots in September, as we expect, U.S. Treasuries should rally as the market shifts its attention to the magnitude of rate cuts not only this year, but also next year and beyond,\" the analysts said.\n\nFinally, U.S. politics will be a key theme for markets, especially after a disastrous debate performance by President Joe Biden last week cast doubt over his ability to stay in the race for reelection. At the moment, polls suggest that the November vote will result in a so-called \"red sweep\", with Donald Trump regaining the presidency and Republicans taking control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nIn such a scenario, the analysts recommended having \"sufficient exposure to financials\", noting that these companies would benefit from conservative lawmakers lowering industry regulations. On the other hand, they expressed some caution around consumer discretionary and renewable energy names, saying they \"could lag\" in the event of a red sweep.",

Yardeni Research highlights that \"investors have poured $330 billion into 26,000 AI startups over the past three years,\" significantly more than in previous years.\n\nWhile this influx of capital has fueled innovation, it has also led to a crowded market with many companies struggling to turn a profit, according to the firm. For instance, they note Stability AI has faced financial difficulties, resulting in layoffs and the departure of its CEO.\n\nSimilarly, they add that Inflection AI, despite raising over $1.5 billion, saw its leadership leave for Microsoft (NASDAQ: ). The concern is that \"if AI startups run out of cash, their suppliers could find AI-related revenues dry up quickly.\"\n\nSecondly, analysts caution that the claims made by AI industry leaders suggest a potential bubble.

    "title": "Scammed by the fake Chinese police",
    "body": "Scammed by the fake Chinese police\n\n8 hours ago By Elaine Chong and Ed Main , BBC Trending Share\n\nBBC Helen Young was targeted by scammers who posed as Chinese police officers\n\nChinese people around the world are being targeted by an elaborate scam in which criminals pretend to be Chinese police. A British-Chinese woman has told the BBC that she handed over her life savings to con men who wore uniforms in video calls and gave her a virtual tour of what appeared to be a police station.\n\nHelen Young still has nightmares about the fortnight that she was made to believe she was on China\u2019s most wanted list. Scammers posing as Chinese police manipulated the London-based accountant into believing she was under investigation for a massive fraud back in her homeland. Helen was presented with a mountain of fabricated evidence which appeared to implicate her in a crime she knew nothing about. When the fake police then threatened her with extradition to a jail cell in China, Helen sent them her \u00a329,000 life savings as \u201cbail money\u201d, in a desperate attempt to stay in Britain. \u201cI feel a bit stupid right now,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there's no chance I can know that's not real. It's so convincing\u201d. Helen\u2019s story may sound extraordinary but there have been numerous similar cases in the Chinese diaspora. China\u2019s embassies around the world have issued public warnings about police impersonation scams, as has the FBI after a number of cases in the US. One elderly woman in Los Angeles reportedly handed over $3m, believing it would stop her extradition.\n\nThe FBI and Chinese embassies around the world have issued warnings about police impersonation scams\n\nTypically these scams begin with the target receiving a relatively innocuous phone call. In Helen\u2019s case it was somebody claiming to be a Chinese customs officer who told her they had stopped an illegal parcel sent in her name. Helen hadn\u2019t sent anything, and she was told she must file a police report if she believed someone had stolen her identity. Although she was sceptical, Helen didn\u2019t hang up. \u201cChinese people like myself because we were born and bred in China, we were taught obedience,\u201d she says. \u201cSo when the party asked me to do something or my parents asked me it\u2019s very rare that I will say no.\u201d Helen was transferred to a man who said he was a policeman in Shenzhen called \u201cOfficer Fang\u201d. Helen asked for proof and he suggested they went on a video call. When they connected, Helen saw a uniformed man whose face matched the police ID he flashed. Officer Fang then used his phone to give her a tour of what looked like a fully functioning police station with several uniformed officers and a desk with a large police logo. \u201cThat moment all my suspicions are gone. So I say: 'I'm sorry, I just have to be careful nowadays, there are a lot of criminals out there',\u201d Helen says. While they were talking, Helen heard a message on the tannoy in the background, telling Officer Fang to take a call about her. Officer Fang put her on hold and when he returned he was no longer interested in the illegal parcel. He said he had been informed that Helen was suspected of involvement in a large financial fraud.\n\n\u201cI said: 'That\u2019s nonsense'. He said: 'Nobody says they\u2019re guilty. So it\u2019s the evidence that counts'.\u201d Helen was shown what looked like a bank statement for a vast amount of money in her name. Officer Fang told her that if she was innocent she must help them catch the real crooks. He made her sign a confidentiality agreement promising not to tell anyone about the investigation. Helen was warned that if she did, she would get an extra six months in prison \u201cHe said: 'If you tell anyone you have been interviewed by the Chinese police, your life will be in danger'.\u201d The scammers also made Helen download an app so they could listen in to what she was doing day and night. Over the next few days, Helen tried to act normally at work. She spent her evenings working on a personal statement that she was ordered to write, detailing every aspect of her life. Then Officer Fang called back with the news that several suspects were now in custody. He showed her written statements in which several people accused her. Helen was sent a video which appeared to show a male prisoner confessing to police, and naming her as his boss in the fraud.\n\nHelen's scammers used a personalised video confession to convince her she was facing criminal charges\n\nWe have taken a closer look at the video, and because the suspect is wearing a large Covid mask, it\u2019s impossible to tell if what you\u2019re hearing matches his lip movements. It would be easy to add a fake soundtrack that mentions Helen's name or another victim. But for Helen - who had been convinced she was dealing with genuine police officers - the effect was devastating: \u201cAfter I heard my name like that I was vomiting. It convinced me I was in deep, deep trouble.\u201d Helen believed Officer Fang when he then told her she would be extradited to China - even though she\u2019s a British citizen. \u201cHe told me: 'So you got 24 hours, you pack your bags. The police are coming to take you to the airport'.\u201d Helen was told she could halt her extradition if she could raise bail. After sending over her bank statements for inspection, she was told to transfer \u00a329,000. \u201cI felt terrible, because I promised my daughter to give her money for her first flat,\u201d Helen says. But a few days later the fake police were back. Helen was ordered to find another \u00a3250,000 or be extradited: \u201cI was fighting for my life - if I go back to China, I may never come back.\u201d After Helen tried to borrow the money from a friend, he alerted her daughter. Helen broke down and revealed everything. But not before she had put her phone in a kitchen drawer and taken her daughter into a bedroom, and put a duvet over their heads so the scammers couldn\u2019t listen in. Her daughter listened patiently and explained it was a scam. Helen\u2019s bank eventually refunded her money, but her ordeal could easily have had a bleaker ending: \u201cFor two weeks I hardly slept. How can you sleep when somebody is monitoring your phone?\" In her sleep-deprived state, she crashed her car twice. On the second occasion, she wrecked it entirely: \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone, but I could have. These types of criminal scam could kill people.\u201d Other victims of police impersonation scams have been pushed to even greater extremes. In some extraordinary cases, some Chinese foreign students who can\u2019t meet the financial demands of the fake police have been persuaded to fake their own kidnappings in order to seek a ransom from their families. Detective Superintendent Joe Doueihi of New South Wales Police fronted a publicity campaign to warn about so-called virtual or cyber-kidnappings, after a series of cases in Australia. \u201cVictims are coerced into making their own video of them being in a vulnerable position, to appear as if they've been kidnapped - tied up with tomato sauce on their body to make it look like they've been bleeding, and calling for help from their loved ones,\u201d he says.\n\nNew South Wales Police Police in Australia have issued warnings after a spate of 'virtual kidnappings'\n\nThe students are then ordered to isolate themselves while the scammers send these images to families back in China, with a ransom demand. The scam victims may also find themselves being manipulated into helping to scam others. \u201cScammers will trick a victim into believing that they are working for the Chinese government. They will send them documentation and swear them in as a Chinese police officer,\u201d Det Supt Doueihi says. He says the victim - who may have already handed over money to the criminals - is sent to monitor or intimidate other Chinese students in Australia.\n\nThe BBC found AI filters which could help scammers mimic police, for sale online\n\nMany of these frauds are thought by experts to be run by Chinese organised crime groups operating from compounds in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. Chinese state media has reported that tens of thousands of suspects have been returned to China over the last year. Awareness of these types of scams is growing. We spoke to a student in Japan who realised he was being targeted by criminals, and recorded their conversation. He asked not to be named, but shared the recording with the BBC. In it, the scammers tell him that if he revealed anything about the call to anyone, then he would be jeopardising the \"investigation\".

    "title": "Of the UK economy\u2019s two possible endings the happy one is more likely",
    "body": "Just as in the movie Sliding Doors, there are two endings to the story that began on Thursday with Labour\u2019s victory in the 2024 election. One is happy, one is sad, and either is possible. What happens to the economy over the next five years will determine which one materialises.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the happy ending: the one where the credits roll as Keir Starmer wins big for a second time in 2029. The script for that one starts slowly. The scale of Labour\u2019s win means it doesn\u2019t have to rush things but has time to put in place the supply-side reforms, such as changes to planning rules, that will boost growth. Structural changes don\u2019t bear fruit overnight but by the early 2030s it should be possible to notice the difference.\n\nIn the meantime the economy will benefit from a much-needed period of stability. Business investment was depressed during the period when there was uncertainty over whether the UK would leave the EU or not. It suffered another hit during the pandemic, and a third after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. A chaotic period in which the UK had three prime ministers and five chancellors in a single parliament is now over.\n\nThe poor showing of the SNP in the election means the prospects of a second referendum on Scottish independence in the next five years are much diminished. Likewise, Starmer is unlikely to reconsider his decision to rule out rejoining the EU (or even the single market) with Reform UK breathing down Labour\u2019s neck in so many seats. As things stand, Britain looks a safer place for investment than France or Germany.\n\nMuch has been said about Labour\u2019s baleful economic inheritance, but growth is set to surprise on the upside in the coming months. Consumer spending power has been boosted in recent months because wages have been rising more rapidly than prices, but there tends to be a lag before households realise they are better off. The election result will be the catalyst for higher consumer spending, and it will also prompt businesses to give the go-ahead for investment decisions put on hold in recent months.\n\nThe boost to growth will provide Rachel Reeves with a bit more scope in her autumn budget. She may also be tempted to make changes to the government\u2019s debt rules, which would provide her with some additional wriggle room. It won\u2019t be a massive windfall, and the new chancellor says money will be tight. But she might have an extra \u00a320bn to spend on public services.\n\nStarmer and Reeves won\u2019t need to rush because the Tories will spend the post-election period at war with each other over the future direction of the party rather than in opposing what Labour is doing. One big problem for Rishi Sunak in his period as prime minister was that the economic and political cycles became misaligned, with tough decisions, such as the freeze on tax allowances and thresholds, biting in the last years of the parliament. The prospects of a second Labour victory will be much enhanced if Reeves gets the unpopular stuff out of the way early and then lets up as the next election approaches.\n\nThe alternative ending is not nearly so cheerful. The gentle recovery in the economy runs out of steam as stubbornly high inflation in the service sector deters the Bank of England from cutting interest rates. Business investment continues to disappoint, while dearer fixed-rate mortgages and stagnant house prices make consumers cautious about spending money.\n\nThe situation cries out for the new government to boost public spending or cut taxes, but Reeves is boxed in by her own self-imposed fiscal rules. Public demands for better public services go unanswered, and disillusionment quickly sets in. Starmer and Reeves insist that their structural reforms will eventually pay dividends but, as was the case when Sunak tried the same line of argument, nobody is listening.\n\nLabour\u2019s landslide victory was the result of a collapse in support for the Conservatives rather than a ringing endorsement of Starmer\u2019s offering. Never before has a party won so big a majority with such a modest share of the vote: 34%. Jeremy Corbyn won a bigger percentage of the vote when Labour was defeated in 2017.\n\nStarmer and Reeves are on probation as far as Britain\u2019s sceptical and impatient voters are concerned, and they are deluding themselves if they think this is 1997 redux. The economy is weaker and public services are in a worse state. Sitting tight for two years is not an option.\n\nIt may take time for the Conservatives to recover from the pasting they have just taken, but there are alternative sources of opposition. The Green party threatens to pick up unhappy Labour voters from the left, while Reform UK could do the same from the right. The Liberal Democrats will be attractive for those who want a closer relationship with the EU. The Tories won big in 2019 but last week lost more than 250 seats. Something similar could easily happen to Labour in 2029.\n\nSo which ending is it going to be? On balance, the happy ending looks slightly more likely. That\u2019s not because the country is set for an economic boom. The UK has deep-seated problems that are not going to be solved overnight. But such was the desire of voters to be shot of the Conservatives that it will take time before they are trusted again.\n\nThe Tories need Labour to screw up the economy to have a chance of a quick comeback, but it is reasonable to assume that the next five years will be better than the previous five. That might not be saying much, but it should be enough.",

    "title": "Precision Drilling Stock: Automation Makes It A Buy (TSX:PD:CA)",
    "body": "PhonlamaiPhoto/iStock via Getty Images\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nPrecision Drilling Corporation (NYSE:PDS) is experiencing a significant increase in the number of service rigs, and more could come, thanks to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and regulatory spending requirements for well abandonment increase. The recent plans for reduction of the debt levels and distribution of 25%-35% of FCF generated to shareholders could accelerate demand for the stock.\n\nPrice Target: Based on my own discounted cash flow analysis, the fair value is $104-$105 per share.\n\nBusiness Review: Drilling Is The Most Relevant Activity\n\nPrecision Drilling is an energy company based in the United States and Canada that has also developed international activity in some areas of its business.\n\nDuring 2023, close to 87% of its revenue came from drilling activity, under specific contracts. The remaining net sales came from the other segment, which offers completion, workover, and ancillary services to oil & gas exploration and production companies. International activity consists of drilling services, which include technology for the development of platforms and consulting to comply with environmental regulations in each case.\n\nCWC Energy Services: Accretive On A 2024 Cash Flow Per-Share Basis\n\nDuring the year 2023, Precision Drilling accomplished the acquisition of CWC Energy Services, which meant an expansion in its activities in Canada, adding 62 drilling service platforms in this country, in addition to equipment, inventory, and operating facilities that were added to the 111 platforms that were already active. The acquisition was valued at $127 million on November 7, 2023. In my opinion, the most relevant is that the company expects the transaction to be accretive on a 2024 cash flow per-share basis. Hence, we could see an increase in cash flow per share in 2024 as compared to that in 2023.\n\nWith the projected synergies, we expect the transaction to be accretive on a 2024 cash flow per share basis and to support our ongoing deleveraging plan. Source: Press Release Precision has achieved headcount and operational annual run-rate synergies of approximately $13 million. Source: Annual Report\n\nAutomation And Data Processing Software To Enhance Drilling Activities\n\nOne of the differentials that Precision has found within the competitive markets of the energy sector is the development of its Alpha digital platform, which uses automation and data processing software oriented towards each of its clients.\n\nIn addition, the company maintains Evergreen technology, developed to optimize environmental pollution rates, through the automation of the operation of drilling equipment and data processing.\n\nDuring 2023, the company had the most modern drilling equipment in Canada, which not only has Alpha and Evergreen technology, but also maintains some robotic functions, adding to the automation capabilities as well as increasing general safety levels in the development of activities.\n\nIn my view, these technologies could enhance future drilling activities, and offer an enhancement in the environmental pollution rates. In addition, clients may demand more drilling services as robotic functions offered increase.\n\nAccording to Market Research Survey, the use of robotic drilling equipment in the petroleum industry is projected to rise at 8.5% CAGR through 2033. I incorporated these assumptions in my forecasts.\n\nNew International Rigs And The Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Represent A Net Sales Driver\n\nIn the last management report, I could read about eight rigs running throughout 2024, which is expected to represent a 40% increase in activity compared to 2023. We are talking about a 50% increase in the company's international EPS, which I think may benefit future earnings expectations and the demand for the stock.\n\nI could also observe a significant optimistic outlook for the business coming from rig activations and new bids. Besides, if clients continue to show up thanks to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and regulatory spending requirements for well abandonment increase, revenue growth could also accelerate.\n\nWe continue to bid our remaining idle rigs within the region and remain optimistic about our ability to secure additional rig activations. As the premier well service provider in Canada, with size and scale, the outlook for this business is positive. Source: Management Discussion, And Analysis\n\nGrowing Number Of Service Rigs, Compliance With Covenants Signed, And Debt Reduction Plans\n\nThere is a significant momentum growth in the number of well servicing rigs. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the number of service rigs was 183. In the same quarter in 2023, the number of rigs was 118. The change in the number of service rigs was 55. In my view, further increase in momentum growth could bring new revenue growth.\n\nSource: Management Discussion, And Analysis\n\nBesides, the company is in compliance with covenants signed. As of March 31, 2024, Precision Drilling reported consolidated covenant EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of 7.4x. The covenant signed was 2.5x.\n\nSource: Management Discussion, And Analysis\n\nAccording to the last annual report, one of the central objectives of the company's present strategy is to reduce the total amount of debt. In the long term, the reduction objectives are $500 million by 2025. The company plans to reduce debt by $150 million to $200 million in 2024.\n\nDuring the year, we reduced our debt by $152 million and allocated 15% of our free cash flow to share repurchases. Our focus on our debt reduction strategy remains firmly in place and in 2024, we plan to reduce debt by another $150 million to $200 million. Source: Annual Report\n\nBesides, in the last quarterly report, Precision promised once again to return 25%-35% of FCF generated to shareholders. In my view, further reduction in the debt levels could lead to increases in the EV/FWD EBITDA ratio.\n\nPrecision remains on track to reduce debt between $150 million and $200 million in 2024 and return between 25% and 35% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2024. Source: Management Discussion, And Analysis\n\nThe CFO Brings Investment Banking Expertise\n\nI reviewed the Board of Directors and the business profile of different members of management. I think that Wall Street analysts may like the profile of Carey T. Ford, CFO of Precision. He brings expertise accumulated in investment banking. In my view, if the company needs to assess potential mergers or acquisitions with other competitors or even the sale of Precision Drilling, he will offer beneficial judgment to bring a beneficial opinion to the Board of Directors. Besides, he may know well what the company needs to offer to market participants and shareholders to enhance the valuation of the company.\n\nCarey T. Ford currently serves as Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer for Precision. He joined the company in May 2011. Mr. Ford previously held the positions of Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations and Senior Vice President, Finance Operations before being named Interim Chief Financial Officer in March of 2016. Prior to joining Precision, Mr. Ford spent seven years as an investment banker at Simmons & Company International serving clients in the oilfield service sector. Source: Precisiondrilling\n\nThe Balance Sheet Shows A Significant Decrease In Total Debt\n\nPrecision's balance sheet shows an asset/liability ratio of more than 2.2x. This ratio increased from close to 1.9x in 2019. Precision Drilling reports an increase in the total amount of property and equipment/total liabilities from 2019 to 2024, which I think is quite beneficial. The company appears to be reducing its total amount of liabilities at a faster rate than the property and equipment.\n\nSource: Author's compilations based on data from the 10-Q\n\nIn the last report, the company reported $2.2 billion in total assets and $1 billion in total liabilities. So, the book value per share is lower than the current stock price. According to Seeking Alpha, the sector median price/book value is close to 1.5x. Given these figures, Precision Drilling appears quite undervalued.\n\nSource: Author's compilations based on data from Seeking Alpha\n\nAs shown in the image below, the total amount of long-term debt decreased by around 13% in 2023, 8% in 2022, and 9% in 2021. In my view, a further decrease in the total amount of debt will most likely lead to an increase in the company's EV/FWD EBITDA.\n\nSource: Author's compilations based on data from Seeking Alpha\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\n\nIn connection with rendering the opinion given and performing my related financial analyses, I reviewed the company's annual report and the most recent report from management. Besides, for the assessment of future Adjusted EBITDA growth, the calculation of EBITDA, changes in net working capital, taxes, and capex, I reviewed SA's tool.\n\nSource: Seeking Alpha\n\nI also assumed a growing number of service rigs, FCF growth thanks to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and regulatory spending requirements for well abandonment increase. Besides, I also expect growth as a result of the use of automation and data processing software.\n\nWith the previous assumptions, I included net sales growth of 4% from 2026 to 2028, with growing D&A, growing capex, and growing unlevered free cash flow. Under my own assumptions, unlevered FCF/Total revenue would be close to 13% and 11% from 2025 to 2028. These numbers were based on my own judgment, previous assumptions, and previous cash flow statements.\n\nSource: Author's Work\n\nFor the selection of the terminal EV/TTM EBITDA, I had a look at the multiples currently reported by peers. Competitors trade at close to 4x TTM EBITDA and 10x EBITDA. I used an exit multiple of 4.5x. Besides, after reviewing previous quarterly reports and 10-Ks, I incorporated a cost of capital of 9%.\n\nSource: Seeking Alpha\n\nFinally, I performed a DCF to calculate the implied equity value. By summing the discounted unlevered free cash flow from 2024 to 2028 and the discounted terminal value, and subtracting the net debt, I obtained a target equity value of $1532 million. Dividing by the total number of shares outstanding, my target value is close to $104-$105 per share.\n\nPrecision's EV/ FWD Sales And EV/ FWD EBITDA Show Significant Undervaluation\n\nA quick look at the EV/FWD Sales and EV/FWD EBITDA ratio reported by Precision Drilling and that from the industry indicates significant undervaluation. The company's EV/EBITDA appears to offer a 27% discount as compared to peers.\n\nSource: Seeking Alpha\n\nOther companies focused on drilling, such as Helmerich & Payne (HP) as well as Nabors (NBR), show an EV FWD EBITDA between 4x-4.5x, which is not far from that of Precision Drilling. Hence, I think that by means of a merger of Precision Drilling with another company offering more services from drilling, the total EV/FWD EBITDA of the new entity may increase.\n\nEquity Research Share Price Targets\n\nI reviewed publicly available consensus estimate stock price targets for the company. I could find Wall Street analysts covering the stock, who published research with an average price target of $100. These numbers are in line with my expectations and price target of $104-$105. It appears clear that most people in the market think that Precision Drilling is undervalued.\n\nWe Saw Mergers In The Sector In 2023\n\nPatterson-UTI Energy, Inc. (PTEN) and NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. signed a merger in 2023, which included $200 million of annual cost savings and operational synergies within 18 months following close. Precision Drilling could also team with another large player in the United States or Canada to generate synergies. I could not blame shareholders for expecting such a similar transaction with other players like Helmerich & Payne, Nabors, Liberty Energy, ProFrac Holding, RPC, Calfrac Well, STEP Energy, or Trican Well. Potential cost synergies observed in the merger between PTEN and NexTier could appear.\n\nRisks From Changes In The Oil Price\n\nPrecision's revenue will most likely fluctuate in relation to the oil price. Lower oil price and gas price may lead to lower drilling activity in the United States and Canada. If clients decide to reduce their activities, Precision Drilling would see decreases in the unlevered FCF. Under this case scenario, analysts could lower their expectations about the future, and the demand for the stock could lower.\n\nGenerally, we experience high demand for our services when commodity prices are relatively high, and the opposite is true when commodity prices are relatively low. The volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices accounts for much of the cyclical nature of the oilfield services business in recent years. Increased volatility and other factors beyond our control have led to greater uncertainty in the demand for our services. Source: Annual Report\n\nRisks From Trans Mountain Pipeline And Regulatory Uncertainty In Western Canada\n\nPrecision Drilling could suffer from delays in the construction of the Trans Mountain pipeline in western Canada. Besides, management noted that other proposed LNG facilities in Canada could also suffer from delays. If the company fails to complete their expected timelines, expected net sales growth may decrease. In the worst case scenario, future unlevered FCF may also decline, and the implied fair price would be lower than expected.\n\nConstruction is progressing on the Trans Mountain pipeline in western Canada and may be in service in the first half of 2024. Canada generally has also lagged behind other natural gas producing countries in taking advantage of rising global demand and prices for natural gas primarily as a result of Canada's lack of liquified natural gas facilities and, by extension, export capacity owing to regulatory delay and uncertainty. Source: Annual Report Other proposed LNG facilities in Canada are at earlier stages of development, including Woodfibre LNG and Ksi Lisims LNG (completions currently anticipated between 2027 and 2028). There is no assurance that LNG projects in Canada will be completed on their expected timelines, or at all. Source: Annual Report\n\nRisks From Violence In The Middle East Region\n\nAs noted, Precision Drilling maintains activities internationally, specifically in the Middle East region, where the capitalizable market is large, and oil activity is highly concentrated. Based on the signing of new contracts and the insurance of its activity within the Middle East for the short and medium term, the company increased its lines of credit for insurance on this activity from $30 million to $40 million. In any case, with regard to this region specifically, the outlook is uncertain due to the growing violence between the Israeli state and neighboring countries. At some point, I think that the activities of Precision Drilling could be affected by the war in the region.\n\nConclusion\n\nPrecision Drilling is currently experiencing a growing number of service rigs, and offered a beneficial outlook thanks to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and regulatory spending requirements for well abandonment increase. I would expect net sales growth as a result of new robotic functions and the use of automation and data processing software. In addition, management recently promised to lower its debt levels as well as to return 25%-35% of FCF generated to shareholders. I think that these initiatives could represent successful future price catalysts for the stock. Based on my own DCF model, peer review, and research of other opinions from analysts, my price target is $104-$105 per share.",

    "title": "Armour Residential: The 15% Yield Indicates Trouble May Be Brewing (NYSE:ARR)",
    "body": "Art Wager/E+ via Getty Images\n\nIntroduction\n\nArmour Residential's (NYSE:ARR) shares have been headed in one direction and one direction only. And that's down. Over the three years, shares of Armour have tumbled 66%, losing two thirds of their value. While the company has been paying a fat dividend to shareholders, I view the current distribution as being unsustainable, even in spite of several cuts. With the current yield at 15%, the market seems to be hinting at signs of trouble. In this article, I'll explain the risks I see with Armour Residential and why I would avoid the company's shares today.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nCompany Overview\n\nArmour Residential is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that is primarily involved in the mortgage-backed securities market, specifically in residential mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities are financial instruments that are comprised of pools of mortgages, where the securities represent an ownership interest in them.\n\nEssentially, Armour Residential invests in mortgages rather than physical properties, and it earns income from the interest payments on the underlying mortgage loans in its portfolio. As a REIT, Armour Residential is required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.\n\nTo pay its distributions and earn income on the mortgage-backed securities, Armour Residential 'arbitrages' the difference between what it can borrow at versus what it can earn in returns. The mortgages it invests in are generally those issued by a government sponsored entity like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae, otherwise known as agency securities. These usually consist of fixed rate loans, but some portion is also backed by hybrid adjustable rate or adjustable rate loans. In addition, to mitigate interest rate risk, the company uses hedges sometimes to manage risk within the portfolio.\n\nBackground\n\nWhen looking at the share price action of Armour Residential over the last three years, investors have lost nearly half of their investment (-43%), even when including huge dividends paid to shareholders. Comparing the return over the last three years to the S&P500's positive total return of 33% illustrates a widening divergence in performance over time, particularly one that I would characterize as destructive of shareholder value.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nSo what's been going on? In my view, Armour Residential pays out an unstable amount of dividends to shareholders that isn't backed up by current free cash flow and earnings. The mortgage REIT model in general is one that's highly levered, so any movement in spread between the cost of borrowing and return on investment of securities could have serious implications to the business.\n\nWe see this impact through the company's dividend history over time. As observed below, there's been a series of at least four cuts in the last five years to the dividend, highlighting that the current dividend warrants scrutiny and could be at risk.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nWhenever you see dividend cuts like this, it's often helpful to ask whether the current dividends are supported by current cash flows and earnings. Over the last five years, with the exception of 2021 when interest rates were near zero, Armour has been generating losses in earnings per share. Since the situation has become somewhat troubling, on the earnings call, management noted that it is suspending management fees until further notice. Previously, the company suspended management fees during the pandemic due to the uncertainty surrounding the business, and since then, they haven't reinstituted that back.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nOutlook\n\nCan Armour right the ship? In my view, if the latest results are any indication, management hasn't been making the right bets to generate earnings for shareholders. At the end of the quarter, book value per share was $22.07 per common share. In the 23 days after quarter end, the book value fell 7.2% to $20.48 per common share.\n\nWhen looking at the yield spreads, during the quarter, net yield on interest earning assets was $5.3 million vs net interest income of $12.2 million. While the quarter had positive net income of $14.5 million, this was in large part due to a favorable move in interest rates and spreads. Going back to FY'22 and FY'23, net income was a loss of $230 million and $67 million, which I think are more reflective of what returns would look like in this business during this interest rate environment. At present, the company pays $3.0 million in dividends to preferred stockholders and 35.3 million in dividends to common shareholders each quarter, which is much higher than current earnings run rate, even for this most recent quarter of positive net income.\n\nCompany Filings\n\nHow should one approach Armour as an investment? With respect to the macroeconomic outlook, the way I would think about Armour is essentially a bet on interest rates. If you're constructive on spreads longer term and that the Fed will begin to aggressively start cutting rates, then an investment in Armour could make sense.\n\nBased on what's being priced into the curve, Jerome Powell's latest comments noted that if the Federal Reserve cuts too much and too quickly, inflation could re-accelerate, which would force policymakers to reverse course and impose punishing rate hikes. On the other hand, if they wait too long to reduce borrowing costs, the Fed risks a weakening of the economy, which could trigger a recession if the market isn't ready.\n\nAt present, inflation is at 3.27%, slightly above the Fed's long-term target of 2%. In my view, I don't foresee the Fed cutting too much. Why? The dollar remains strong (ability to print more money if needed given political issues in Europe), rhetoric from the Fed has been hawkish, and overall GDP growth looks poised to climb at least 2% this year.\n\nOverall, I think most investors have underestimated the resiliency of the U.S. economy, and it may, in fact, turn out that we get few rate cuts than previously expected. Earlier this year, the market was pricing in 5 rate cuts, and it's looking less likely that's about to happen.\n\nGiven this, I'm inclined to avoid shares of Armour. With implied leverage of 7.4 and Debt/Equity of 6.8, I find Armour to be carrying risk above my comfort level.\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, an investment in Armour is a levered bet on interest rates. However, even if you think interest rates are going to come down faster than expected, I'd still avoid shares. Over the last ten years, shares have lost about 88% of their value and so even as interest rates have dropped over time, there's still been somewhat of an impairment in value. While the company pays generous dividends at a 15% yield, investors should be cautious investing in what I see as a value trap and a yield that's not adequately supported through the company's earnings and cash flows. In my view, with an unsustainable yield and a leveraged balance sheet, I would avoid shares today and rate shares as a 'sell'.",

    "title": "PotlatchDeltic: Inflation Hedge Being Given Away For Cheap (Rating Upgrade) (NASDAQ:PCH)",
    "body": "Andrei Metelev\n\nSome would say that we are stalking PotlatchDeltic Corporation (NASDAQ:PCH) and they would be in the ballpark of being right. Just look at the most recent three reviews of the company from our side.\n\n1) When we reviewed PCH in September of last year, we highlighted the rapidly declining operating income. The company was not even generating sufficient cashflow to cover its distribution. There were a few positives that offset some of the negatives noted above and we noted them in that piece. On the whole we were neutral on the stock and suggested $45 strike covered calls, expiring in May 2024 for those bullish (cost basis net of premium = $40.92)\n\nData by YCharts\n\n2) We wrote on this ticker again, and if you guessed it was in December 2023, you would not be wrong. If you guessed that we became bearish on the stock, we would be uncomfortable with how well you know us.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nThe three reasons that made us mildly optimistic on the stock back in September, no longer held true and we told you run for the hills and away from the timberlands.\n\n3) The most recent piece we wrote on this ticker was in April of this year. The stock had declined further and was trading at $41.19 then and we felt this was time once again to upgrade the stock to a hold. It would be an understatement to say all of these tactical trading calls have paid of far better than a buy and hope methodology. The price is getting closer to where we said we would start getting interested in the covered calls for this stock.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nBut do the current fundamentals justify the stock price? Let's review the recent numbers and find out.\n\nQ1-2024\n\nPCH had a tough 2023 relative to 2022, but things were way rougher in early 2024. Adjusted EBITDA was just at $29.4 million and the previously strong wood segments delivered negative numbers.\n\nPCH Q1-2024 Presentation\n\nYou can see the variance work up from Q4-2023 in the slide below. That looks a bit better and the key detractor there was lower developmental real estate sales.\n\nPCH Q1-2024 Presentation\n\nTimberlands has held steady here and it is the only one providing PCH with some cash flow today.\n\nPCH Q1-2024 Presentation\n\nWood products, while negative, was a big improvement from Q4-2023.\n\nPCH Q1-2024 Presentation\n\nWe can see the overall trend in the next picture. As lumber prices have lost all lumbar support, PCH has seen its adjusted EBITDA dwindle.\n\nPCH Q1-2024 Presentation\n\nEven the comparatives from 2023 don't really pain the full picture. You can see $200 million generated in adjusted EBITDA for all of 2023. Compare that to the adjusted EBITDA for just one quarter in 2021.\n\nGenerated record Total Adjusted EBITDDA of $275.0 million and Total Adjusted EBITDDA margin of 61%\n\nSource: PCH\n\nNot only has the EBITDA dropped precipitously, even the modest leverage the company carries has now become enormous. EBITDA leverage which generally runs at around 2X for PCH, is now near 5.0X.\n\nPCH Q1-2024 Presentation\n\nCash available for distribution or CAD has been running negative for two straight quarters.\n\nPCH Q1-2024 Presentation\n\nSo you would have to be blind to not see just how challenging the current setup is.\n\nWe Are Doing What???\n\nThe thing with cyclical sectors is that things look horrible at bottoms. There is no end in sight to negativity. Here, we have some of the worst Lumber prices in a long time. These prices are even lower when you adjust for inflation. After all you need labor to cut down trees and then you need the mills (which cost a lot more than they did 2 decades) back, to get your lumber from your timber. So yes prices are bad. We have the very obvious possibility of a recession and housing demand cannot possibly move up into that. So the chart below, which looks pretty bad, will get worse.\n\nITSO\n\nWe also have apartment construction peaking. We know because we have been dangling the chart in front of anyone who will look at it. The REITs themselves are telegraphing that inflation pressures are still strong and a rapid cut cycle is not in the immediate future. So the confluence of negativity is epic. That is also precisely what cyclical sectors look like at bottoms. PCH trades here at a solid 40% discount to consensus NAV as well. There is nothing stopping that NAV from moving lower. There is nothing stopping the discount from widening. But this is a price where if you have a long term outlook, you have to be fairly excited. You were not that chaser who went after it because PCH was producing heaps of cash flow in 2021. You are the methodical investor who realizes that this is an inflation hedge coming to you for cheap. Think about the possibilities when supply-demand equation turns, as it always does for commodities. PCH could easily double from here and dole out massive dividends along the way. Our favorite indicator is also flashing green. This is the Commitment of traders (COT) number which shows the smart-money, also known as the \"Commercials\" heavily long. Those unfamiliar might want to read our \"Sell\" rating article where we were bearish on PCH because of this. We have not seen such a bullish setup on Lumber before.\n\nBarChart\n\nVerdict\n\nWhile the debt to EBITDA may look scary, we evaluate this more in terms of debt to NAV. On that metric the total debt is about 15%-20% of NAV. They also have a ton of liquidity. But if they don't like the cost of debt, they can always dispose of the debt. Worst case scenario here is that PCH may have to liquidate a little timberland for 2024 and 2025 maturities.\n\nPCH Q1-2024 Presentation\n\nAll in all, PCH offers a trading opportunity as well as a longer term accumulation opportunity. Those buying for the long term may want to average in here slowly and possibly use covered calls to buffer their entries. One example is shown below.\n\nAuthor's App\n\nThis one also offers potential for some capital appreciation.\n\nWe rate this a Buy.\n\nPlease note that this is not financial advice. It may seem like it, sound like it, but surprisingly, it is not. Investors are expected to do their own due diligence and consult with a professional who knows their objectives and constraints.",

    "body": "mammuth/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images\n\nTesco PLC (OTCPK:TSCDF) continues to maintain the guidance of a flat profit development into next year, meaning that their strategy of funneling sales into Finest, which has a positive mix effect as discussed in our previous coverage, is working. It also means that they expect revenue acceleration in the coming quarters thanks to the Euros and the Olympics. These positives are needed because there has been a major minimum wage effect of 9%. The businesses under pressure in Booker are not major profit contributors. In all, we think that the guidance is reasonable and achievable. However, Tesco trades in line with peers, and we don't see them having any special edge at this point in a relative sense. In an absolute sense, we think that better and more obscure businesses can be bought at lower multiples on broader markets, and Tesco will always have to battle with fierce competition and pressure from wages.\n\nQ1 Trading Update\n\nAs usual, Tesco does not provide profit data in its Q1 and Q3 trading updates, with more significant disclosures only happening at the H1 and FY marks. Nonetheless, the trading update is a useful moment for analysts to ask questions and for qualitative disclosure to be made.\n\nThe first thing we note are the current sales changes. They are solid at around 3.4% growth in revenues, and the inflation impact is now quite minimal at not more than 2%. Volumes are strong in several of the segments, and the focus on keeping cost increases minimal has meant significant market share gains by Tesco in a continuing trend. Their policy is an Aldi price match.\n\nOur progress is clearly demonstrated by our growth in market share. With the latest Kantar read showing the highest gains for the last two years. This has been supported by 15 consecutive periods of switching gains... Ken Murphy, CEO of Tesco\n\nSales Highlights (Q1 TU)\n\nThe UK is seeing strong growth in volumes, and one of the elements at play is that they are commanding the mid-market within their shops with supermarket label Finest, which is an up-trade from their other Tesco labeled products but still more competitive in pricing than the branded products on their shelves. In our last coverage we noted that branded sellers were getting more aggressive with promotional pricing in order to compete with Tesco products, which is good for the national inflation situation and, of course, for Tesco customers, reflecting the highly competitive nature of the business.\n\nFinest is being expanded with pub classics now on offer in order to capitalise on what should be a solid couple of quarters for sports events. The Euros is the current consideration, with England continuing to get deeper in the tournament, and Tesco hopes it will get some biannual benefit from customers treating themselves when eating in to watch the games. The Olympics comes after and should offer some similar benefit.\n\nThe weak segment has been Bookers. Best Food Logistics was acquired at a nominal price and provides distribution services to customers like Burger King and Pret in the UK. They are downsizing their reach to try to improve profits, since the profitability is marginal in the business.\n\nLook, I mean, on your first question on Best Food Logistics and profitability. Look, it's not a material piece of the profit, so it's less than a handful of million. Imran Nawaz, CFO of Tesco\n\nTobacco is in secular decline. Taking a comp of Logista (OTCPK:CDNIF) which also does tobacco distribution, we see that tobacco distribution might be more of a profit detractor. The tobacco distribution business should have similar operating margins to the Tesco average based on this comp. But it is only around 3% of revenues still, and even annualising the 5% decline, we are only talking about 4-5 million GBP lost.\n\nBooker Breakdown (Q1 TU)\n\nThey also made a new acquisition within Booker of a spirits and drinks business that they can integrate and provide wholesale.\n\nValuation and Risks\n\nThe wage increase of employees is going to cost Tesco around 300 million GBP. Sainsbury (OTCQX:JSNSF) will also be investing around 200 million GBP. Labour costs are sampled at around 9-12% of sales for grocers. The figures provided by Sainsbury and Tesco imply a lower rate at their stores, around 6% for Sainsbury and around 5% for Tesco, knowing that both are doing around 10% wage increases at their stores.\n\nHowever, by another calculation, 220,000 employees affected are getting a 2,000 GBP annual pay increase, which amounts to an increase in costs of around 440 million GBP for Tesco or a little less than 10% of gross profit.\n\nRegardless, to hit profit targets, we think a comprehensive 5% sales growth will need to be achieved based on last year's annual figures before wage hikes. This estimation is based on the assumption that some commodities have deflated, and it should be possible to grow revenues while keeping incremental COGS growth outside of the wage increases flat. A more conservative guess would be to assume that Tesco manages to control gross margins at current levels of around 7% as of the FY, which would require an 8% sales increase to offset around 400 million GBP in increased wage costs, a midpoint of the given figure and our back of the envelope calculation.\n\nIS Snapshot (FY 2023 PR)\n\nWith mix effects, not all of that 5% needs to be volumes. Importantly, the Euros and the Olympics should be able to accelerate revenues beyond the current 3.9% mark to be able to hit 5% for the year. More mix and less volume effects are more likely to accrete the gross margin, since volume is more operationally intensive.\n\nWe think these numbers are doable, although the 8% sales growth would maybe be a stretch. But more importantly, we aren't that happy with Tesco's valuation. Its PE is almost exactly in line with another supermarket and grocer stock in the UK, Sainsbury. There is no relative valuation case at around 12.5x PE, and there isn't a super absolute case either. The reciprocal of the PE is the earnings yield, and it is less than 8%.\n\nBusinesses like Tesco aren't without risks. There are significant competitive challenges at all times, reflected in the fact that a major operational policy is to make sure that all prices are matched to Aldi, which is low cost, and there is meaningful pressure from labour prices as well, reflected in the substantial wage increases they've had to undertake and the intensity of coverage of the cost of living crisis in the UK. We feel that there are plenty of businesses at that PE or lower that are under less pressure and face fewer potential issues in more obscure markets, avoiding the supermarket and grocery business altogether, which has a challenging industry structure.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

    "title": "My Top 15 High Growth Dividend Stocks For July 2024",
    "body": "Pavel Muravev/iStock via Getty Images\n\nQuality Stocks\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY) added 3.53% in June posting its 7th positive month out of the last 8 calendar months. Vanguard's Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF Shares (VIG) posted a more modest gain of 1.41%. And my watchlist performed the weakest of the three, positing a gain of 0.69%. The watchlist continues to struggle in 2024, thus far trailing SPY and VIG every single month this year. Year-to-date my watchlist is down 4.85%, meanwhile VIG is up 7.66% and SPY is up 15.23%. While this underperformance is very large, strong past performance has kept the watchlist relatively close to VIG since inception.\n\nThis isn't the first time the watchlist found itself in a rough patch, and it likely won't be the last. However, relying on long-term data, I have conviction the strategy will bounce back and recoup lost ground in the months to come.\n\nThis is the first 6 month streak of underperformance for the watchlist relative to SPY and VIG since inception. Previously, the longest losing streak was 4 months, on two separate occasions.\n\nEven though SPY and VIG are off to a better start, my watchlist remains within a reasonable range to VIG and sees its gap to SPY continue to widen. Since inception, September of 2020, the watchlist has a CAGR of 11.07% compared to 11.18% for VIG and 14.02% for SPY.\n\nMy goal is not to beat SPY or VIG but to generate a long-term rate of return of at least 12%. Even though the watchlist posted a positive gain in June, its long term CAGR declined.\n\nThe main goal of this watchlist is to find the best combination of high-quality companies trading for attractive prices. I believe this is the optimal long-term strategy for building wealth.\n\nThe top 15 dividend growth stocks for July 2024 offer an average dividend yield of 1.56%. Collectively, they have increased dividend payments at a rate of 22.25% during the last 5 years. Based on dividend yield theory, these 15 stocks are about 31% undervalued right now, and I think they are poised to offer strong long-term returns.\n\nI would suggest considering two approaches to dividend investing. The first involves dollar-cost averaging into a diversified portfolio comprising at least 10-20 high-quality dividend-paying stocks spanning various sectors and industries. By adopting a dollar-cost averaging strategy, you mitigate the risk associated with attempting to time the market. Over an extended period, this method allows you to acquire shares at market highs, lows, and in-between, ultimately establishing an average cost basis situated in the middle.\n\nThe second method introduces a slightly higher level of risk. It entails investing in undervalued stocks while still adhering to a dollar-cost averaging strategy. In this approach, you diversify across a minimum of 10-20 distinct, high-quality companies spanning multiple sectors and industries. The increased risk stems from the possibility that your valuation methodology may prove inaccurate. However, by spreading investments across multiple stocks, the likelihood of correctly identifying undervalued opportunities may improve. The potential upside resulting from accurate selections may well outweigh any underperformance stemming from less successful picks.\n\nWatchlist Criteria\n\nThe criteria used to determine which stocks are included in my high-growth dividend stock watchlist remain unchanged for July 2024. It is made up of the 8 factors listed below that have historically outperformed the broad universe of dividend-paying stocks when analyzed collectively.\n\nMarket Cap of at least $10 billion.\n\nPayout Ratio no greater than 70%.\n\n5-year Dividend Growth rate of at least 5%.\n\n5-year Revenue Growth rate of at least 2%.\n\n5-year EPS Growth rate of at least 2%.\n\nS&P Earnings and Dividend Rating of B+ or better.\n\nWide or Narrow Moat (Morningstar).\n\nExemplary or Standard Management Team (Morningstar).\n\nThe rules identified 114 stocks for the month that were all ranked based on the above-mentioned metrics with the exclusion of market cap. I then computed the current valuation for each stock using dividend yield theory. All stocks were ranked for both quality and valuation, and sorted by the best combination of both. Next, I computed a forecasted rate of return for the next 5-year period for each of the stocks. This return is based on forecasted earnings growth, a return to fair value, and the dividend yield.\n\nThe highest-ranked 15 stocks with a forecasted return greater than or equal to 12% were chosen for the watchlist. The long-term hypothesis for this watchlist is that it will outperform a broad-quality dividend fund such as Vanguard's Dividend Appreciation ETF, VIG and that it will generate a 12% annualized rate of total return.\n\nWatchlist For July 2024\n\nCreated by Author\n\nAbove are the 15 stocks I am considering for further evaluation during the month. They are sorted in descending order by their rank and 5-year dividend growth rate.\n\nThe \"O/U\" column represents potential undervalue; this is a comparison of the current dividend yield to the historical dividend yield as a function of share price.\n\nThe expected return in the table above was computed using a discounted 5-year EPS forecast, a return to fair value, and the current dividend yield. There is also a margin of safety built into the forecasted return. These figures are just assumptions based on the available data, and there is no guarantee these returns will be attained.\n\nThere are 3 changes to the top 15 list from the prior month. Elevance Health (ELV), FedEx (FDX) and TJX Companies (TJX) have fallen further down the list, or do not meet the 12% expected rate of return threshold and were replaced by Albemarle (ALB), Coca Cola Europacific (CCEP) and Canadian National Railway (CNI).\n\nPast Performance\n\nThe top 15 list from June posted a modest gain of 0.69%, underperforming both benchmarks, and as a result, the long-term alpha has shrunk further. The long-term annualized rate of return for the watchlist decreased from 11.12% last month to 11.07%. My target rate of return is 12%, and the modest setback in June has moved the watchlist further from its target.\n\nMonth Top 15 All VIG SPY 1 Month 0.69% 0.78% 1.41% 3.53% 3 Month -3.47% -2.78% 0.46% 4.39% 6 Month -4.85% 4.66% 7.66% 15.23% 1 Year 2.26% 16.05% 14.12% 24.49% 2020 6.27% 6.15% 9.09% 7.94% 2021 33.81% 31.55% 23.75% 28.76% 2022 -8.58% -15.12% -9.80% -18.16% 2023 20.89% 21.88% 14.50% 26.18% 2024 -4.85% 4.66% 7.66% 15.23% Since Inception 49.54% 51.21% 50.11% 65.37% Annualized 11.07% 11.39% 11.18% 14.02% Click to enlarge\n\nTop 5 past and present watchlist stocks in June 2024:\n\nFedEx (FDX) +18.70%\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) +15.02%\n\nLam Research (LRCX) +14.41%\n\nIntuit (INTU) +14.01%\n\nNvidia (NVDA) +12.69%\n\nOne of the top 15 stocks selected for the month of June was amongst the top 5 performing stocks last month, FedEx. In total, there have been 82 unique dividend stocks selected by this watchlist since September 2020. It is worthy to note that Activision Blizzard was amongst this list prior to being acquired by Microsoft.\n\nTop 5 Stocks by Total Return since joining the watchlist:\n\nNvidia (NVDA) +827.36% (39 months). KLA Corporation (KLAC) +171.55% (38 months). Applied Materials (AMAT) +151.25% (41 months). Progressive (PGR) +145.48% (41 months). Costco (COST) +139.48% (46 months).\n\nSince not all stocks have been on the watchlist for the full 46 months of their existence, comparing a monthly average return can help normalize the results. Here are the top 5 stocks with the highest average monthly return since joining the watchlist.\n\nNVIDIA +5.88% (41 months) Discover Financial Services +4.00% (10 months) Bank of America +3.54% (10 months) KLA Corporation +2.66% (38 months) Applied Materials +2.27% (41 months)\n\nDrivers Of Alpha\n\nThe watchlist underperformed VIG in June. Only six watchlist stocks outpaced the ETF last month.\n\nThe remaining 9 stocks underperformed VIG.\n\nTotal Return For All Watchlist Stocks\n\nHere are the total returns for all past and present watchlist stocks since first appearing on the watchlist. Out of the 82 stocks that are on this list, 65 (64 last month) have positive total returns and 17 have negative total returns, the average return is 41.77% (38.61% last month). The watchlist has been around for 46 months, and the average duration for all 82 stocks is 33.76 months.\n\nSymbol Since Joining Count NVDA 827.36% 39 KLAC 171.55% 38 AMAT 151.25% 41 PGR 145.48% 41 COST 139.48% 46 LRCX 128.83% 41 CTAS 127.70% 41 MPWR 124.86% 40 APH 123.13% 41 MSFT 104.62% 46 TSCO 101.57% 41 INTU 94.80% 46 BK 90.24% 46 ADP 86.63% 46 TJX 81.73% 41 CDW 76.76% 41 JPM 72.03% 41 ROL 63.45% 29 UNH 60.48% 41 DFS 48.09% 10 MCO 47.89% 46 SCHW 46.16% 41 CI 45.10% 28 EXPD 45.02% 41 FAST 42.51% 46 FDX 42.03% 28 BBY 42.00% 24 BAC 41.64% 10 BLK 39.24% 46 LMT 38.97% 46 SHW 37.86% 41 LOW 36.64% 46 GGG 36.28% 46 NOC 34.77% 46 ROP 34.74% 46 MSCI 33.69% 46 ACN 33.31% 46 HD 33.01% 46 DPZ 32.02% 46 GS 30.72% 35 WRB 29.91% 15 ICE 29.85% 41 BX 28.65% 23 TXN 28.54% 41 V 27.20% 46 MA 25.72% 46 MCHP 24.11% 13 TMO 22.10% 39 FDS 20.76% 46 USB 19.30% 44 MS 18.61% 37 EOG 17.87% 16 WST 17.00% 46 NTRS 16.39% 46 DE 12.15% 31 ELV 10.50% 5 KR 8.82% 12 ZTS 6.00% 17 JKHY 5.55% 46 CCEP 5.39% 3 CMCSA 5.32% 46 ATVI 4.39% 29 WTRG 1.61% 6 HUM 0.98% 40 ALLE 0.03% 12 ROST -0.74% 3 SSNC -1.28% 40 TROW -3.02% 46 CRH -12.69% 3 ODFL -19.96% 4 GPN -25.10% 4 SWKS -26.99% 30 SBUX -29.49% 30 NKE -30.06% 6 DG -32.47% 39 LAD -33.96% 39 BALL -35.57% 30 FMC -50.04% 25 SIRI -55.22% 27 AAP -61.64% 24 MKTX -61.67% 41 PARA -74.98% 36 Click to enlarge\n\nDividend Analysis For New Stocks\n\nBelow are a 7-year dividend yield theory chart, a dividend history chart, and a dividend growth table for the 3 new stocks on the watchlist this month.\n\nFirst up is Albemarle.\n\nThe chart below shows the actual price of Albemarle (black line) graphed along with the following 3 valuation zones.

Five of the stocks presented during the last 46 months have gone on to lose more than 50%. A watchlist, much like an index, includes both good and bad companies. It's very difficult to create an automated stock selection strategy that only produces great ideas. However, rather than focusing on the few bad apples that have appeared on this list, let's shed a little light on its success. Eleven stocks identified by this process have gone on to produce returns in excess of +100% and another eight have generated returns in excess of 50%.\n\nI have used this list to find many great stocks that I have added to my personal portfolio, but I encourage you to use it primarily as a starting point for further research. The watchlist aims to find the best combination of high-quality companies trading for attractive prices. It's based purely on quantitative data and therefore may not consider important qualitative factors that may impact future returns.",

    "title": "PepsiCo: Consistent Earnings Growth Despite Challenging Conditions (NASDAQ:PEP)",
    "body": "Fotoatelie\n\nOverview\n\nAs a dividend growth investor, I love the ability to collect income from companies that have very visible product portfolios. The cusp of summer is here and that means lots of barbeques, family gatherings, and events that will have PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) products. I previously covered PEP and discussed how the price drop made it more attractive than Coca-Cola (KO). This time around, I wanted to provide an updated valuation and talk about how the lackluster recent performance can be attributed more to cyclical vulnerabilities rather than fundamental issues within. I will be providing my personal thoughts on the upcoming earnings as well.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nWe can see that PEP has lagged the S&P 500 (SPY) over the last five-year period. However, this isn't unique, since we can also see that the consumer staples sector (XLP) has also be underperforming. This underperformance can likely be linked to factors such as elevated interest rates and continued high inflation levels month after month. This sort of environment encourages tightening consumer spend and, as a result, PEP has experienced slower sales growth than normal. Despite the slower growth rates, PEP has managed to offset this by strengthening their balance sheet with increased cash positions.\n\nIn addition, PEP remains attractively priced from a valuation perspective. I believe that the price of PEP remains heavily suppressed by the current high interest rate environment. Despite the slower growth rates, PEP has still ultimately managed to grow when other consumer-based peers are struggling to maintain the same momentum. Let's first take a look at the current financial picture and why I believe that PEP still remains a buy despite the underperformance.\n\nPepsi Earnings Preview\n\nPEP's portfolio of products has allowed the company to have several different avenues that generate revenue. The North America beverage channel brings in about 30% of the net revenue while the Frito-Lay portfolio brings in about 27% of the net revenue. Data compiled by Deloitte shows us that consumer spending has continued to decrease while consumers prioritize saving in an effort to offset higher inflation levels and higher interest rates.\n\nDeloitte\n\nDespite these challenges, PEP has been able to grow year over year net revenue. Taking a look at their last annual report, we can see that net revenue increased by 6% year over year. Most importantly, free cash flow has increased by 39% year over year, totaling $8.1B. PEP has boosted their free cash flow by shaving down expenses through different cost-saving initiates and job layoffs. For instance, PEP continues to lay off employees within the Frito-Lay segment as a way to offset slower sales growth and maintain profitability momentum. Creating a larger emphasis on cash during times where the sector goes through lower sales volume helps put PEP in an ideal situation to manage these headwinds efficiently.\n\nIf PEP is able to maintain this level of free cash flow growth going forward, there's a likely chance that the dividend will also continue to grow at a sufficient pace. This free cash flow can also be used to increase capital expenditure to continue growing their strong portfolio of products. Capital spending did increase 6% year over year and this trend is likely to continue as it attracts new customers through new products and promotions. They are able to grow these cash flow levels by implementing price increases in all segments, across all regions of operations. While this was a good way to offset lower volumes throughout the pandemic era, I don't know how necessary these price increases are to maintain growth going forward.\n\nAs interest rates are cut and inflation continues to cool, these things may serve as a catalyst to higher consumer spending. We've already seen inflation tick down for two consecutive months and this could give the consumer a bit of relief which translates to an increased likelihood of sales volumes increasing. The higher volume of spending could eliminate the absolute need to continue increasing prices. I stay cautious that squeezing customers too much could cause them to shift their focus to cheaper alternatives in the snack and beverage category.\n\nPEP Annual Report\n\nPEP will be announcing their Q2 earnings on July 11th and I believe that the quarter will show continued strength in their balance sheet, even if sales are slumped. Since PEP continues to prioritize strong cash management, I think there's a possibility that we see free cash flow grow. Earnings per share for their Q1 results amounted to $1.48 but Q2 has historically been a stronger quarter for PEP.\n\nThis leads me to believe that its possible we can see a higher EPS of at least $2.10 - $2.20, which would align with the consensus EPS estimate of $2.16. Q2 earnings per share has continued to grow year after year since 2020. After all, the fiscal year guidance still sees an estimated 4% increase in organic revenue and an 8% increase in core constant earnings per share.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nLiquidity remains strong, however, with cash and equivalents totaling $8B as of the latest report. For reference, PEP ended the year 2022 with cash equivalents sitting at $4.9B. Additionally, when rates were near zero levels in 2020, their long-term debt total sat at $40.3B, but this has since come down to $37.7B which is more ideal in this high interest rate environment. PEP should be able to navigate these headwinds as cash from operations totals $12.79B and cash per share sits at $5.85, which sits well above the sector median of $1.63.\n\nVulnerabilities & Comparison\n\nInterest rates remain a vulnerability to consumer-facing companies like PEP. It's no coincidence that as interest rates were cut to near zero levels in 2020, the price of PEP started to rapidly appreciate consistently until interest rates started to get hiked. Throughout the course of 2022, interest rates were consistently increased and as rates approached their peak, PEP's price lost its upward momentum and eventually retracted back to the current level and stabilized.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nInterest rates increase the cost of borrowing and may slow any growth initiatives that PEP may want to pursue. Their long-term debt sits at one of the highest levels ever over the last decade, now totaling $37.7B. If portions of this debt were issued on a floating rate bases, this would mean that it is more expensive to maintain this debt balance, as interest payments would rise.\n\nOn the consumer side of things, higher interest rates also contribute to lowered consumer spend. Taking a look at the consumer price index changes, we can see that food related costs have increased by about 25% between 2019 to 2023. As a result, this may cause lots of consumers to shift their spending to cheaper alternatives. This is a huge vulnerability since there are plenty of store-branded alternative potato chip and soda options out there. There is survey data to support the fact that 54% of shoppers say they'll choose store-branded grocery items as a substitute for national brands.\n\nUSDA\n\nStore branded alternatives are typically cheaper, which adds to their appeal during these unfavorable market conditions. I imagine that a lot of consumers out there are able to stomach the marginal difference in taste and quality of these snack and soda products if it means they get to save a bit of money. As mentioned, the continual price increases that PEP has been implementing have a finite lifespan, and it'll eventually tire the consumer and cause them to shift their dollars elsewhere.\n\nThe consumer sector continues to underperform the rest of the market, but PEP has remained one of the top choices in the sector. Just to serve as a comparison, I've grouped together some beverage and snack peers that operate in similar market spaces. We can see that the revenue growth of PEP has outpaced these peers, totaling 36% over a five-year span.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nEven when comparing the total return over the last five years, we can see that PEP is on the top end of the range, only being beat by Coca-Cola. However, KO has a much slower dividend growth rate and doesn't have as steady of an earnings growth performance since the pandemic.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nEven when looking at the dividend growth over the last five years, PEP also remains at the top end of the range. The combination of these performance metrics makes PEP the most well-balanced option to gain exposure to the consumer sector. PEP provides an excellent level of dividend growth, revenue consistency, cash and equivalents buffer, and strong pricing strategy that has offset lower volumes.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThe Recovery - Valuation\n\nPEP remains attractive priced in terms of valuation metrics. PEP's valuation has always traded at a premium to the sector medians, so in this case, it would be more appropriate to compare PEP to its own five-year average ratios. For instance, PEP currently trades at a price to earnings ratio of 24.7x compared against the sector median price to earnings ratio of 19.6x. However, PEP's five-year average price to earnings ratio is closer to 26.5x. In addition, PEP's price to book ratio sits at 11.8x, which undercuts its five-year average price to book ratio of 13.6x. These metrics may indicate that there is some upside to be captured here when conditions in the sector improve.\n\nWall St. analysts seem to agree with this consensus, based on their average price target of $185.03 per share. This would represent a potential 12.5% price upside from the current level. The highest price target sits at $210 per share, while the lowest price target sits at $151 per share. In order to get another source of reference for an estimated price target, I also wanted to run a discounted cash flow calculation. Free cash flow per share sits at $5.27 and while management provided an estimated EPS growth target of 8%, I wanted to manage expectations and consider any potential underperformance. Therefore, I thought a 7% estimated growth rate was a reasonable input here.\n\nI wanted to keep the estimated growth rate at 7% even after the initial two years in the table below so that expectations can be aligned with the sector median. The year-over-year median EBITDA growth for the sector sits at 6.9%. Additionally, PEP's own five-year average revenue growth is about 7.25%, so I think that using a 7% baseline growth rate is totally reasonable when looking forward.\n\nMoney Chimp\n\nWith these inputs in mind, we come to an estimated fair value of $187.96 per share. From the current price level, this indicates a potential upside of over 14% which closely aligns to the Wall St. price target. When you consider this potential upside is accompanied by a growing dividend, we have the opportunity to capture a double-digit return by accumulating here.\n\nPepsi Dividend Growth\n\nPEP's management has proven to value the dividend growth by maintaining consistent raises. PEP recently increased their dividend by 7% and the latest quarterly dividend sits at $1.355 per share, making the current dividend yield 3.3%. The dividend remains well-supported despite the ongoing headwinds. The payout ratio currently sits at 66%, which is aligned with the five-year average payout ratio of 67%. I believe that the payout ratio can be improved once sales start to increase and operating profit margins improve. As long as the payout ratio doesn't rise above the 70% mark, I feel confident that PEP will be able to maintain.\n\nPEP has crossed into dividend king territory by consecutively raising dividends for over 51 years in a row. The dividend growth has been quite solid and delivers the level of growth sufficient enough to compound dividend income over time. For instance, the dividend has increased at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 8.1% over the last ten years. Even on a smaller time frame of five years, the dividend has increased at a CAGR of 6.6%.\n\nThis level of consistent growth makes it ideal for dividend growth investors that wish to have a source of reliable dividend income. To visualize this, I ran a back test of a $10,000 investment over the last year. This graph also assumes that you added a fixed monthly contribution of $500 to your investment, as well as reinvested all dividends back into PEP to help accumulate more shares and compound your income quicker.\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nIn 2015, your dividend income would have totaled $392. Fast forwarding to 2023 reveals that through a combination of a long-term outlook and continual accumulation of more shares, your dividend income would have now grown to $3,178. This means that your income would have almost 10x'ed over the last decade holding period. Most importantly, the dividends received from PEP are classified as qualified dividends. This means that the income received from PEP would be treated at the most favorable tax rates. This is what makes PEP such a valuable holding for investors looking to eventually retire off their dividend income.\n\nTakeaway\n\nIn conclusion, PEP remains a compelling buy at these levels. The company's efficient cash management and ability to continue growing revenue in unfavorable conditions is a testament to the high quality here. The upcoming earnings will likely show continual improvements in the balance sheet as cash equivalents grow while debt gets eliminated. From a valuation standpoint, I think there is the potential for a solid double-digit upside to be captured here, which can be fueled by the eventual increase in sales volume from lower interest rates. The combination of lower interest rates and cooling inflation should ultimately contribute to earnings growth moving forward. In the meantime, I plan to continue collecting a growing stream of dividends until market conditions improve.",

    "title": "1 Phenomenal Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
    "body": "The pace of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption has only accelerated over the past year and has shuffled the ranks of some of the world's largest companies, with several household names vying for bragging rights. Microsoft currently leads the pack, having unseated Apple, each with a market cap of roughly $3.4 trillion. Nvidia's rise through the ranks has been breathtaking to behold, having nearly tripled over the past year to take the third spot at $3 trillion. Several other major purveyors of AI, namely Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms, boast valuations of between $1.3 trillion and $2.3 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of just $49 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like sacrilege to propose that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, might be headed for the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating adoption of AI has increased the need for servers capable of running and training AI systems, and the company's long track record of success makes Supermicro a clear candidate for inclusion in this elite fraternity.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nFlexible server options\n\nWhile Supermicro has made a splash in recent years, investors might be surprised to learn the company has been creating customized servers for more than three decades. The accelerating adoption of generative AI shone a spotlight on the under-the-radar server maker, bringing it out of the shadows.\n\nSupermicro's claim to fame is the company's highly customizable building-block architecture, which helps the company provide server solutions for customers of all sizes and shapes. Furthermore, Supermicro's long focus on energy efficiency has taken on greater significance as cost becomes a factor. It also offers a variety of free-air, liquid-cooling, and traditional air-cooling technologies, giving each customer just what they're looking for.\n\nThe company has partnerships with all the leading chipmakers, giving it access to the most in-demand AI processors. This includes strong working relationships with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.\n\nThis approach has served the company well. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), Supermicro's revenue surged 200% year over year to $3.85 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $6.65 jumped 308%. Management is guiding that its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year guidance to revenue of $14.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $23.69, which would represent growth of 109% and 100%, respectively.\n\nManagement reports that Supermicro is growing at nearly 20 times the industry average, which clearly shows the company is taking market share from the competition. Analysts at Bank of America agree, suggesting Supermicro will increase its market share from 10% last year to 17% by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nSupermicro is one of the premier names in the AI server market. The company's agility has been paramount in taking share from its rivals, as its building-block server architecture means it has something for everyone. Supermicro has also established critical partnerships with the chipmakers that supply the company with the most requested processors, giving it ample supply to meet the accelerating demand.\n\nDespite those advantages, it will still be some time before Supermicro ascends the ranks to become a trillionaire. According to Wall Street, Supermicro is poised to generate revenue of $14.9 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $305 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\n\nIt's important to put this in context: The company is ramping up its production capabilities just to be able to generate sales of $25 billion annually, so a nearly 20-fold increase in revenue is still off in the distant future.\n\nIf the company were able to keep up its triple-digit year-over-year growth rate, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap by 2029. However, keeping up that frantic pace of growth for five years would be unparalleled for a well-established company. Yet, even if we cut its growth rate in half, Supermicro could hypothetically reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\n\nWhile that might sound far-fetched, the evidence suggests it's more likely than you might think. BofA analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya posited the AI data center market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% over the coming three years, and by taking share from its rivals, Supermicro's revenue could \"grow even faster.\"\n\nHe's not the only one who thinks the data center upgrade cycle is about to take off. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes the installed base of data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years to support the accelerating adoption of AI.\n\nSo if Supermicro is successful in capturing even a small part of that fast-growing market, the path to the $1 trillion club will be paved with profits.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Generative AI Sales Could Soar 2,040%: My Pick for the Best AI Stock to Buy Now (Hint: Not Nvidia)",
    "body": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) uses large language models and other machine learning models to create text, images, video, audio, and computer code. Use cases range from digital assistants that improve worker productivity to intelligent avatars that make video games more lifelike.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence expects generative AI revenue to exceed $1.3 trillion in 2032, up from $63.5 billion in 2023. Put differently, Bloomberg believes spending across generative AI hardware, software, and services will surge 2,040% over the next nine years.\n\nSome analysts see an even bigger market. For instance, McKinsey & Company research suggests generative AI will eventually contribute $7.9 trillion annually to the global economy. Opportunities like that come along rarely, so investors should position their portfolios accordingly.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a logical stock to own. In fact, I think most investors should have some exposure to the chipmaker. But Nvidia is by no means the only company that will benefit, and owning a single AI stock is a poor strategy. Here's why I think Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) is the best AI stock to buy now.\n\nNvidia dominates the market for artificial intelligence processors\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) have long been the gold standard in accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence. The spotlight has certainly intensified over the past year, given that Nvidia's revenue and net income have grown at a triple-digit pace for four consecutive quarters. But investors should understand that Nvidia did not stumble mindlessly into its recent success.\n\nNvidia has dominated the data center GPU market for nearly two decades, and the company has been setting performance records at the MLPerfs -- objective benchmarks that measure how quickly AI systems can perform AI training and inference tasks -- since those tests were created in 2018. One reason for that success is the CUDA programming language, which lets Nvidia GPUs (originally built for computer graphics) accelerate other data center workloads.\n\nNvidia introduced CUDA in 2006, and the platform has since expanded to include hundreds of frameworks and software libraries that streamline data preparation, model training, and AI application development. No other chipmaker has a supporting software ecosystem that is remotely comparable, so Nvidia has naturally emerged as the leader in AI processors. To quote The Wall Street Journal, \"Nvidia chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe problem (if there is one) is valuation. Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually over the next three to five years. If that number is divided into its current price-to-earnings ratio of 74, the result is a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 2.2. That is not exorbitant. In fact, that multiple is a discount to the three-year average of 3.1, so risk-tolerant investors should consider buying a small position today.\n\nHowever, I think Super Micro (also called Supermicro) is the better buy right now because the stock is much cheaper, yet the company stands to benefit greatly as businesses invest in generative AI hardware.\n\nSupermicro is gaining share in the artificial intelligence server market\n\nSupermicro builds accelerated computing platforms. Its portfolio spans individual servers and storage systems to full-rack solutions purpose-built for enterprise and cloud data centers. The company works closely with partners like Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices to equip its hardware with the latest chips.\n\nSamik Chatterjee at JPMorgan Chase sees Supermicro as the \"leading company in the AI compute market.\" More importantly, Supermicro is quickly gaining market share. The company accounted for 10% of AI server sales through the quarter ended in December, but Tom Blakely at KeyBanc says that figure could reach 23% this year. He also believes Supermicro has \"competitive moats that should sustain if not expand this share in coming years.\"\n\nBlakely is referring to internal manufacturing capabilities and a unique building-block approach to product development. Engineers comprise about half of Supermicro's workforce, and the company handles most research and development internally (in Silicon Valley). In turn, Supermicro can quickly and efficiently bring new products to market, and its modular approach only enhances that ability.\n\nSpecifically, Supermicro is often first to market with new technologies because it can \"quickly assemble a broad portfolio of solutions by leveraging common building blocks across product lines.\" In other words, the company can quickly outfit partially preassembled servers with the latest central processing units (CPUs), GPUs, memory, and interconnects, such that it often beats its competitors to market.\n\nCEO Charles Liang recently highlighted that advantage: \"We provide optimized AI solutions at scale, offering a time-to-market advantage and shorter lead times over our competition.\"\n\nSupermicro trades at a more reasonable valuation than Nvidia\n\nThe number of annual AI server shipments is expected to increase sixfold between 2023 and 2028, according to 650 Group. Supermicro is well positioned to benefit as demand increases, given its market leadership, which itself is supported by internal engineering capabilities and a unique approach to product development.\n\nWall Street expects Supermicro to grow earnings per share at 48% annually over the next three to five years. If that number is divided into its current valuation of 47 times earnings, the result is a PEG ratio below 1. To be clear, Supermicro is not a hidden gem. In fact, it was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 during the first half of 2024. But its valuation is very reasonable, especially compared to Nvidia's PEG ratio of 2.2.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Prediction: 2 AI Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Palantir 3 Years From Now",
    "body": "Palantir Technologies' (NYSE: PLTR) stock price has rallied about 50% this year as the data analytics company dazzled the bulls with its accelerating revenue growth and soaring profits. Its revenue rose 17% in 2023, and it expects 20%-21% growth in 2024 as its government business stabilizes and its U.S. commercial business accelerates. It's also stayed profitable for six consecutive quarters, and analysts anticipate 71% earnings growth this year.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Palantir to grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 56%. That rosy outlook, along with Palantir's growth potential in the AI market, drove its stock higher.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut Palantir's stock isn't cheap right now at 21 times this year's sales, and it could struggle to maintain those premium valuations if the macro and competitive headwinds throttle its near-term growth. So if you're worried the stock will lose its luster again, you should check out two less valuable AI companies that might just be worth more than Palantir in three years: Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU).\n\nWhat do these two AI companies do?\n\nSuper Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, produces high-performance, liquid-cooled servers for demanding data center tasks. It generates about half of its revenue from dedicated AI servers, and its long-term partnership with Nvidia grants it access to the chipmaker's new data center GPUs before many of its top competitors. Bank of America expects its share of the dedicated AI server market to grow from 10% to 17% over the next three years.\n\nBaidu owns the largest online search engine in China. It also owns a majority share of iQiyi, one of the country's leading streaming video platforms, the Apollo software platform for autonomous vehicles, and the Baidu AI Cloud platform. It generates most of its revenue from online ads, but it's been diversifying that core business with Managed Business Pages (which empower it to manage a client's entire brand presence within its ecosystem) to reduce its dependence on traditional search and display ads. It's also beefing up its mobile app with more tools and expanding its non-marketing (cloud, AI, and other) division to reduce its exposure to the macro-sensitive advertising market.\n\nWhy could these two companies become more valuable than Palantir?\n\nSupermicro and Baidu could become more valuable than Palantir because they both look cheaper relative to their estimated sales growth over the next three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompany Market Cap Price-to-Sales Ratio (Current Year) Estimated Revenue CAGR (Next 3 Years) Palantir $57.6 billion 21.3 20% Supermicro $49.6 billion 3.3 58% Baidu $31.0 billion 1.6 6%\n\nData source: Yahoo Finance, Marketscreener.\n\nIf Palantir maintains its lofty price-to-sales ratio through 2026, it could be worth $80.6 billion in a bull case scenario by 2026. But if the macro or competitive headwinds unexpectedly curb its growth, its price-to-sales ratio could easily be cut in half.\n\nIf Supermicro matches analysts' expectations and simply maintains the same price-to-sales ratio over the next three years, it could be worth about $93 billion by 2026. It should fetch an even higher valuation if it's finally revalued as a higher-growth AI stock instead of just a legacy server maker like Dell Technologies.\n\nBaidu's recent growth has been throttled by competitive and macro headwinds in China, but its valuation is being severely compressed by the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. If those tensions ease, we might see Baidu's stock trade at about 4 to 5 times its forward sales again -- as it did about four years ago. If Baidu merely matches analysts' estimates and trades at about 4 times sales by 2026, it would be worth $88 billion. But that's a base case scenario: it could be worth a lot more if its new cloud and AI investments pay off and significantly boost its sales again.\n\nBut are Supermicro and Baidu better buys than Palantir?\n\nWe should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they indicate that Palantir's stock is more richly valued than Supermicro and Baidu. Benjamin Graham said: \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\" I believe Palantir is still in the voting phase as investors pay a premium for its AI-driven features, but Supermicro and Baidu have advanced into the weighing phase -- so they could both outperform Palantir over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Nvidia and Broadcom Announced 10-for-1 Stock Splits. This Nasdaq-100 Stock Is Most Likely to Split Next.",
    "body": "Nvidia shares have surged 760% since the beginning of 2023, and Broadcom shares have surged 205% during the same period. Nvidia has already reset its share price by completing a 10-for-1 stock split on June 7, and Broadcom has a 10-for-1 stock split planned for July 12.\n\nImportantly, Nvidia was the fourth-most expensive stock in the Nasdaq-100 prior to its split, and Broadcom is currently the third-most expensive stock in the index. That's not surprising. The primary purpose of a forward stock split is to reduce the share price, thereby making the stock more accessible and more liquid.\n\nWith that in mind, the Nasdaq-100 stock most likely to split next is the one with the highest price, which is Booking Holdings. However, as my colleague Jon Quast eloquently describes, CEO Glen Fogel opposes the idea of a stock split. So, we can strike Booking Holdings from the list and move on to the next most expensive stock, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI).\n\nInvestors should never buy a stock just because they expect it to split, but MercadoLibre is a worthwhile long-term investment whether it splits or not. Read on to see why.\n\nMercadoLibre is the market leader in e-commerce and retail advertising in Latin America\n\nMercadoLibre operates the largest online commerce and payments ecosystem in Latin America, a region where e-commerce penetration is about half that of the United States. Its marketplace receives nearly four times as many monthly visitors as the next competitor. MercadoLibre is expected to account for 29% of domestic online retail sales this year, up 70 basis points (0.7 percentage points) from the prior year.\n\nMercadoLibre has reinforced its success with adjacent financial services, logistics support, and advertising tools, which make its marketplace more convenient for merchants. The company has been successful on all counts. MercadoLibre is one of the largest fintech companies in Latin America, it operates the fastest and most extensive domestic delivery network, and it accounts for more than 50% of retail media ad spending in the region.\n\nMercadoLibre reported strong financial results in the first quarter, handily beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 36% to $4.3 billion, reflecting sales growth in the commerce and fintech segments of 49% and 22%, respectively. Meanwhile, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income increased 71% to $6.78 per diluted share.\n\nDuring the first quarter, commerce sales benefited from increased adoption of fulfillment and advertising services, indicating that MercadoLibre is more effectively monetizing merchants on its marketplace. Additionally, fintech sales benefited from accelerating growth in total payment volume and increased engagement with credit products.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows MercadoLibre's revenue growth across both segments over the last five quarters.\n\nMercadoLibre's commerce revenue growth has accelerated in four consecutive quarters.\n\nGiven its strong presence in several markets, investors have good reason to believe MercadoLibre can maintain that momentum. The company is steadily gaining share in e-commerce, which bodes well for its fintech and advertising businesses. In fact, MercadoLibre is forecasted to be the fastest-growing ad tech company in the world in 2024.\n\nMore broadly, the digital economy in Latin America is expected to expand at 23% annually over the next three years.\n\nMercadoLibre stock trades at a reasonable price compared to Wall Street's earnings forecast\n\nWall Street expects MercadoLibre to grow earnings per share at 51% annually through 2026. In that context, the current valuation of 74.2 times earnings appears reasonable, especially when the two-year average is 109.7 times earnings.\n\nInvestors should be cognizant of the risks. Most notably, Argentina (MercadoLibre's third-largest geography behind Brazil and Mexico) is suffering from hyperinflation, such that domestic sales declined 22% in the first quarter, as measured in U.S. dollars, despite surging 239%, as measured in Argentine pesos. That will likely be a headwind for the foreseeable future.\n\nMercadoLibre has historically been a very volatile stock. It carries a three-year beta of 1.59, meaning it moved 159 basis points for every 100-basis-point movement in the S&P 500 during the last three years. Volatility cuts both ways. When MercadoLibre shares are rising, they can rise quickly. But when the stock is falling, it can fall sharply.\n\nInvestors comfortable with that type of risk and volatility should consider buying a small position in this potential Nasdaq-100 stock-split stock today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

    "title": "This Stock Beat Nvidia in the First Half. Can It Do It Again?",
    "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) added to its winnings in the first half, gaining about 150% after already climbing 1,300% over the past five years. The company dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, holding an 80% share, and also sells a variety of related products and services to companies launching AI projects. This has resulted in growth, with earnings advancing in the triple digits quarter after quarter.\n\nAs great as this sounds, though, Nvidia isn't the best performer of the first half. Another stock actually soared past the chipmaker, skyrocketing 188%. This company also operates in the AI space and has seen earnings climb -- and this player actually benefits from growth of Nvidia and other chip designers.\n\nCould this Nvidia- and market-beating stock offer investors a repeat performance in the second half? Let's find out.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nServing AI data centers\n\nThe player that's wowed the market in recent times actually has been around for quite a while -- more than 30 years to be exact. I'm talking about Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), a maker of servers, workstations, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment crucial to the operations of AI data centers. Supermicro's revenue progressively rose over the years, but the AI boom marked a clear turning point, helping sales and net income to skyrocket.\n\nEarlier this year, Supermicro even reported its first $3 billion quarter -- that was the company's annual revenue level as recently as 2021.\n\nSupermicro has benefited from demand for top AI chips because customers generally need not only a chip but a variety of equipment -- and the company integrates these chips into its products. So when Nvidia or Intel, for example, launch a new chip, this creates demand for Supermicro's products too. To maximize the benefit, Supermicro works hand-in-hand with these companies, monitoring their development pipelines so that it can immediately include their innovations in its equipment.\n\nAnd Supermicro's \"building blocks\" process -- with most of its products sharing common parts -- also makes it easy to quickly produce equipment tailored to customers' needs. All of this has helped the company grow five times faster than its industry over the past 12 months.\n\nThere's reason to be optimistic this will continue because AI market growth is in its early days. Analysts predict today's $200 billion market will reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade -- and this should translate into sustained demand for Supermicro's products.\n\nStory continues\n\nA new growth driver\n\nOn top of this, Supermicro's direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology may serve as a new growth driver for the company. AI data centers generate a tremendous amount of heat, and this situation only will worsen as workloads intensify.\n\nBut Supermicro's DLC technology solves this problem, and customers now are taking notice. Supermicro's DLC solutions, increasing from zero market share to less than 1% in the company's 30-year history, could take as much as a 30% share over the next couple of years, The Taipei Times reported, citing the company's chief executive officer Charles Liang.\n\nAll of this means Supermicro's spectacular growth may be far from over, and in the second half of this year, Nvidia's release of its game-changing new architecture -- Blackwell -- and chip could offer the equipment maker a new boost. Supermicro recently offered a sneak peek of its Blackwell products and says it's focused on developing new generative AI and inference-optimized systems accommodating the market leaders' latest chips.\n\nCould Supermicro beat Nvidia?\n\nNow, let's get back to our question: Could Supermicro continue to beat Nvidia and the general market in the second half? I think it's very likely this equipment giant will outperform the market, thanks to its growth prospects and position in the hot area of AI.\n\nAs for surpassing Nvidia's gains, it's possible. In spite of Supermicro's first-half increase, the company trades at a significant discount to the chip designer -- about 24x forward earnings estimates versus 46x for Nvidia. At the same time, the earnings-per-share growth estimate of 62% for the coming five years for Supermicro tops average estimates of 46% for Nvidia.\n\nThese points could attract investors and help Supermicro soar in the second half. But even if this top equipment company doesn't offer us a repeat performance in the coming months, that's OK. Supermicro still has what it takes to deliver earnings growth and share performance over the long term, and that's great news for investors today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "body": "By Nidal al-Mughrabi\n\nCAIRO (Reuters) -Hamas is waiting for a response from Israel on its ceasefire proposal, two officials from the militant Islamist group said on Sunday, five days after it accepted a key part of a U.S. plan aimed at ending the nine-month-old war in Gaza.\n\n\"We have left our response with the mediators and are waiting to hear the occupation's response,\" one of the two Hamas officials told Reuters, asking not to be named.\n\nThe three-phase plan for the Palestinian enclave was put forward at the end of May by U.S. President Joe Biden and is being mediated by Qatar and Egypt. It aims to end the war and free around 120 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas.\n\nAnother Palestinian official, with knowledge of the ceasefire deliberations, said Israel was in talks with the Qataris.\n\n\"They have discussed with them Hamas' response and they promised to give them Israel's response within days,\" the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that negotiations would continue this week but has not given any detailed timeline.\n\nHamas, which controls Gaza, has dropped a key demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before it would sign an agreement. Instead, it said it would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, a Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.\n\nA Palestinian official close to the peace efforts has said the proposal could lead to a framework agreement if embraced by Israel and would end the war.\n\nU.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns will travel to Qatar this week for negotiations, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe conflict was triggered nine months ago on Oct. 7 when Hamas-led fighters attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages in the worst assault in Israel's history, according to official Israeli figures.\n\nMore than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military onslaught, according to Gaza health officials, and the coastal enclave has largely been reduced to rubble.\n\nThe U.N. agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, called the situation increasingly tragic, saying in a post on X, \"families continue to face forced displacement, massive destruction and constant fear.

    "body": "Government in Tata talks but not guaranteeing all jobs\n\n35 minutes ago By Mark Palmer & Nick Bourne , BBC News Share\n\nPort Talbot's Tata steel plant future a 'major priority' - Reynolds\n\nThe UK government's new business secretary has said \"job guarantees\" will form part of the negotiations with steel giant Tata about its Port Talbot site. Jonathan Reynolds said there was \"a better deal available\" on the future of the plant, but said newer technologies would employ fewer people. The previous Conservative government agreed a \u00a3500m rescue package to help keep the plant open and shift to greener production methods, but 2,800 UK jobs would still be lost. Mr Reynolds said he and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had already spoken to Tata and were involved in active negotiations over the Port Talbot plant's future. \"I'm going to make sure that job guarantees are part of the negotiation that we're having,\" he told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.\n\nPressed on whether that meant he could guarantee all jobs, he responded: \"Blast furnaces employ more people than some of the newer technologies available. \"So there's a range of things you have to understand but I absolutely agree with the point that we have to make sure that this is a transition which works for working people and that they're part of that.\" Tata responded to Labour's election victory by saying it would \"be engaging with new ministers over our ambitious plans to invest in and transform Port Talbot\". Mr Reynolds said the timescale for the government's negotiations was \"not a large one\".\n\nPA Media One of the furnaces at Port Talbot closed last Friday and a second will shut in September\n\nUnite union general secretary Sharon Graham said the steel industry had been decimated. She said it needed investment, job guarantees and procurement legislation that \"all UK infrastructure projects should use UK steel\". \"We need to back British steel, we need to back British business - investment is going to be key,\" she told the BBC. Mr Reynolds said Labour's manifesto had pledged \u00a32.5bn on top of the \u00a3500m already agreed by the former government. \"It's not about underwriting loss making businesses in perhaps the way we might have thought of industrial policy in the past. It is about being a partner for investment in the future,\" he said. \"There is more money available for the steel industry under our plans for government, but that's about making sure we make this transition with the private sector together and recognise how we have to make sure that decarbonisation is not de-industrialisation and we've got to do that together. \"But there is a better deal available for Port Talbot and the steel industry as a whole - I'm sure of that.\"\n\nGetty Images Tata says Port Talbot\u2019s blast furnace operation has been incurring losses of \u00a31m a day",

    "title": "6 foods that could be making you age faster",
    "body": "You know that the foods you eat affect everything from your waistline to your mood. New research shows how your diet may also play a role in how well you age.\n\nSeveral studies have explored the connection between popular diets and aging: The Mediterranean diet has been shown to slow the progression of aging and foods rich in antioxidants and nutrients like vitamin E and choline\u2014hello nuts, eggs and fish\u2014appear to have a protective effect on cognitive health. But what about foods that have the opposite effect?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sugar, fat and salt, preservatives\u2026and other chemical compounds [in a typical American diet],\u201d says Raelene Brooks, PhD, RN, dietician and dean of the College of Nursing at the University of Phoenix. \u201cThose types of foods lead to an inflammatory response that can affect our DNA in a negative way, which can lead to aging.\u201d\n\nThese six foods could make you age faster:\n\n1. Coffee\n\nNed a java jolt to get going in the mornings? You might want to limit it to a couple of cups.\n\nCoffee drinkers who consumed more than six cups of coffee per day tended to have smaller brain volume and a 53% higher risk of being diagnosed with dementia compared to coffee drinkers who filled their cups less often. Some research even found that each 100 mg of caffeine (about the equivalent of one cup of coffee) was linked to 2.4 years of accelerated aging. But you might not need to abandon your morning cup of Joe altogether.\n\n\u201cThere are many more studies suggesting benefits of coffee,\u201d explains Alice H. Lichtenstein, D.Sc., leader of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Team at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University\n\nIn fact, moderate amounts of coffee have been linked to numerous health benefits from improved muscle strength to decreased risk of cardiovascular disease; some research even found that those who drank between 1.5 and 3.5 cups of coffee per day were 21% less likely to die during the study period than non-coffee drinkers.\n\n2. Dairy\n\nConsuming milk has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and colorectal cancer but a growing number of studies have explored the downsides of dairy.\n\nWhole milk might be especially problematic. In addition to higher rates of prostate cancer and Parkinson\u2019s disease, it\u2019s been linked to higher rates of cognitive decline in older adults and increased biological aging.\n\n\u201cWhole milk has a higher fat content and there has been research linked to a higher fat diets and inflammation,\u201d Brooks says. \u201cWhen inflammation gets triggered\u2026the cells are not able to regenerate efficiently [and] start to degrade.\u201d\n\n3. Spicy foods\n\nBland diets are, well, bland, but adding too much spice to your food might put you at higher risk of developing dementia.\n\nResearchers followed a group of older Chinese adults for 15 years and found that those who consistently consumed more than 50 grams (about \u00bc cup) of chili per day had lower cognitive scores than those who ate less spicy meals.\n\nIt might not be a worrisome finding in the United States\u201445% of Americans expressed a preference for \u201cmild\u201d foods\u2014so don\u2019t go giving up the chili paste, hot peppers and curry powder just yet. But Brooks does suggest opting for fresh spices and over processed options.\n\n\u201cThe combination of preservatives and sodium [in some packaged spices and hot sauces] could affect the brain,\u201d she explains.\n\n4. Sodium\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that sodium is hard on your heart.\n\n\u201cIn many people, excess dietary sodium increases blood pressure,\u201d says Lichtenstein. \u201cHigh blood pressure is associated with increased risk of stroke, heart disease [and] age-related chronic diseases.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend limiting sodium intake to 2,300 milligrams per day, but most Americans consume 50% more, possibly because sodium is hiding in foods ranging from condiments and cereal to processed cheese. Those sneaky sources of sodium may be harming your brain.\n\nDiets that were high in sodium, which one study defined as greater than 12,000 milligrams (or 2.1 teaspoons) per day, were linked to lower cognitive function and a 330% increase in the risk of cognitive impairment.\n\n5. Carbohydrates\n\nHave a love-hate relationship with carbs? So does science. The high protein/low carb keto diet might make your organs age faster or it could improve brain performance (or not).\n\nEven though the research is contradictory, one thing is clear: Carbohydrates trigger an inflammatory response, which has a negative impact on your health. But Brooks has one word for those who think aging well means giving up pasta and bread. \u201cModeration.\u201d\n\n6. Artificial sweetener\n\nYou might want to skip the diet soda.\n\nDrinking one diet soda per day was associated with an increased risk of dementia and higher artificial sweetener consumption was linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk, including heart attack and stroke. Lichtenstein calls the link \u201ctenuous\u201d and notes that it could be attributed to other risk factors, including diets higher in red and processed meats and ultra-processed foods.\n\nBrooks is less surprised by the results.\n\n\u201cArtificial sweeteners are man-made chemicals designed to trick the brain into thinking it\u2019s eating sugar but without the calories,\u201d she says. \u201cAnytime you\u2019ve got that type of compound that\u2019s triggering the brain [and causing] inflammation it\u2019s a negative thing.\u201d\n\nMore on aging well and living longer:",

    "body": "Have you thought of hiring a personal trainer or group classes at the gym are working for you? Many fitness enthusiasts are now opting for personal trainers to help them stay consistent with their exercises, push their limits, and try new things such as adding weight training, cycling, boxing, or weight-lifting to cardio workouts.\n\nNaomi Wakhu, who has been a personal trainer for 12 years, says people shy away from personal trainers as they consider them to be expensive. However, she underscores the need for a personal trainer saying, \u201cMany people nowadays prefer working with a personal trainer because they can hold you accountable and keep you motivated.\n\n\u201cA personal trainer makes work easier for you. You do not have to do anything. No one can pay Sh3,000 for a session and not get value for their money. Clients get to interact with their trainers one-on-one,\" she says, adding that personal trainers are flexible, adapting to client schedules and physical abilities, and accommodating weather, making it easier for them to help you achieve your fitness goals.\n\nNaomi Wakhu does a plank on the ring workout exercise at VMX Fitness Gym in Nairobi on July 4, 2024. Photo credit: Bonface Bogita | Nation Media Group\n\nShe gives an example of one of her longest customers.\n\n\u201cI have been with my longest client for five years now and I have gotten to watch her through the different phases of her life. Within five years, she has gotten pregnant twice. I have seen her body change during the first pregnancy, where she lost balance and developed a weak core. After her first baby, she came back as she wanted to be fit and well-toned. We worked on this. She got pregnant again and found she was unable to do some core workouts all over again. I worked with her during the pregnancy helping her hips open up. Now eight months after her second birth, her core is strong and she has more balance. This is what I love to see,\u201d says Naomi, who trained at the Alison Caroline Institute International school as a fitness coach.\n\nI was to meet Naomi at 2pm and by 2:04 pm she had arrived at VMX Fitness Gym in Nairobi's Village Market.\n\n\u201cAs a personal trainer, you cannot afford to be late for appointments,\u201d she says.\n\nHer typical day starts at 5am and you will always find her carrying her helmet. \u201cI use Bolt Boda or Uber Boda as it helps me to manoeuvre through the heavy traffic in the city as I rush to train my clients.\u201d\n\nOver the years, her clients' list has grown. \u201cI do trainings from Monday to Friday. I also have online sessions on Zoom because I have clients from the US, Brazil and Germany,\u201d she says.\n\nThe clientele\n\nThe majority of her clients are couples and elderly people.\n\n\u201cOlder people are more driven to stay alive and energetic. Older people exercise to deal with hip and back problems, and they cannot go to gyms, so I go to their homes. Others have undergone several surgeries, so I help them do exercises that help rehabilitate their bodies,\" she says.\n\n\"The younger clients I work with are more interested in losing weight, growing their glutes, bulking and gaining muscle,\" she adds.\n\nHaving seen a gap, she is now focusing on being a personal trainer for the seniors, helping them with movement.\n\n\u201cWorking with the older generation has taught me how crucial movement is to one\u2019s general health. What matters most is your mobility. Even if you build muscles but your mobility is not good, you are going to struggle,\" she says.\n\nThe exercise plan\n\nTo come up with an exercise regime for her clients, because personalised exercises work best, Naomi first has to check their height, body measurements, and blood pressure, and find out if they have undergone any surgeries or any injuries.\n\n\"This helps to determine everyone's workouts,\u201d Naomi says adding, \"The exercises start with warm-ups, and end with stretches. I also incorporate a lot of mobility exercises. These help ensure one does not get injuries. Mobility exercises make the joints move and exercise your spine. When you do mobility exercises, your muscles stretch fast and it is easier to get results because there is better blood flow in the system. Finally, we do the main workouts to help you build strong muscles and bones. These depend entirely on what the client wants. Some want to lose weight, add weight, or just feel good,\u201d Naomi says.\n\nNaomi Wakhu does push-ups at VMX Fitness Gym in Nairobi on July 4, 2024. Photo credit: Bonface Bogita | Nation Media Group\n\nThe equipment\n\nSo what equipment do you need if you want to work from home with a personal trainer?\n\n\u201cMost of my clients have fully equipped gyms. But what you must have are resistance bands, ankle weights, sliders and dumbbells,\" she says.\n\nBut bodyweight exercises for those who have no home gyms also help one lose weight and tone their muscles.\n\n\"I teach Pilates exercises to those who have no equipment as it helps strengthen their muscles and improve flexibility,\" she says, adding that she also carries her own resistance bands, dumbbells and ankle weights to spice up the Pilates classes.\n\nOne of the fears that people have in bringing a personal trainer to their home is privacy.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nNaomi says she signs contracts with her clients. This, she says, protects her as she goes to train people from one home to another.\n\n\u201cI ensure that I maintain professionalism with a client. I do not get too personal with my clients. Once we sign the contract, it ensures that my interests and those of my clients are protected,\u201d she says.\n\nNaomi\u2019s personal training career stemmed from frustration. She was a volleyball player.\n\n\u201cImmediately after high school, I left my home village in Busia and moved to Nairobi to join a volleyball team. I played volleyball for three years before things took a different turn. I was one of the best players, and I was sure that I would be on the list of players on the 2013 team, but when the list came out, my name was not there. This, I believe, was fuelled by the fact that I had an altercation with my coach,\u201d she says.\n\nNaomi Wakhu poses for a photo during a boxing workout at VMX Fitness Gym in Nairobi on July 4, 2024. Photo credit: Bonface Bogita | Nation Media Group\n\nThe pay\n\nPersonal training also pays well.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, I got my first client, and from then on, my client base has grown mainly as a result of referrals. Now, I train at least six clients a day. A session costs Sh3,000, but many people pay in packages. So I charge Sh30,000 for a package of 10 sessions,\u201d the 33-year-old says.\n\nShe adds, \u201cWhen I finished school, I was timid and naive. I didn\u2019t know how to get started. Back then, I would even take Sh500 per session. Then I started getting more client referrals, and this gave me confidence that I may be doing a good job.\u201d\n\nWhen she is not training a client in their homes, you will likely find Naomi at VMX Fitness Gym and Calisthens Fitness Centre.\n\nHer fitness journey\n\n\u201cWhen I started training, it was all because I wanted to feel and look good but now I am more interested in my mobility,\u201d she says.\n\nTo improve herself, Naomi is currently doing callisthenics, which is mainly focused on \u201cyour mobility and flexibility. Naomi, who says that your weight is also highly dependent on what you eat, has taken up a high-protein diet.",

Bondholders \u2013 which include big investment groups such as BlackRock, Pimco, Fidelity and AllianceBernstein \u2013 have said they are willing to take a 20% loss.\n\nUkraine\u2019s official bilateral creditors, including the UK, have agreed to continue suspending Kyiv\u2019s debt payments until 2027, but there has been no agreement to extend the arrangement with private creditors. The relief offered by private creditors is worth around 12% of Ukraine\u2019s annual national output (GDP).\n\nUnless a deal is struck or an extension to the two-year moratorium is agreed by the end of this month, Ukraine will formally default on its debts in September.\n\nKyiv fears that once the 1 August deadline expires, asset managers will sell their bonds to hedge funds, which will then sue. Ukraine\u2019s bonds are all governed by English law, so any legal case would be brought in the UK.\n\nDebt Justice said Ukraine\u2019s bonds were trading at 28-31 cents on the dollar, closer to Kyiv\u2019s suggested 60% haircut than the 20% bondholders have proposed.\n\nHeidi Chow, Debt Justice\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cUkraine is resisting an invasion. It should not have to fight off shameless bondholders at the same time, who are trying to squeeze every ounce of profit out of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThese loans were given at high interest because of the supposed risk. That risk materialised the day Russia invaded.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s bonds \u201care governed by UK law, so an incoming UK government could pass a law to support Ukraine by making it clear that no lenders can sue the country while the war carries on\u201d, she said.\n\nThe Commons international development select committee called last year for legislation that would force private creditors to take part in debt relief, and in opposition Labour expressed support for the idea.\n\nDebt Justice is urging the government to change the law so that a debtor country negotiating in good faith with its creditors could not be sued. It says this would give Ukraine the political and legal protection to maintain the current debt suspension until bondholders were willing to accept the scale of debt restructuring required.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "title": "The Stock Market Is In One Giant Trade That Is Near Its End",
    "body": "FatCamera/E+ via Getty Images\n\nIf the \"rally\" in the S&P 500 seems confusing, it shouldn't be. The rally is nothing more than a handful of names continuing to push the overall concentrated index higher. At this point, most of the gains are driven by the volatility dispersion trade, as traders play Ring Around the Rosie with the Magnificent 7 names.\n\nIt may seem completely random to see Amazon (AMZN) suddenly break out of trading starting on June 20 after struggling for months, coming on surging call volume and rising implied volatility. \"It must be the AI trade; that is the only explanation! Of course\". However, notice in the chart below how the gains seemed to stop once the call volume subsided and implied volatility leveled off.\n\nBloomberg\n\nIt wasn't only Amazon that was in on the action; Microsoft (MSFT) was too. With the stock price surging, driven by a big move higher in implied volatility and stronger option volumes\n\nBloomberg\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG) played along the week of June 20 with similar characteristics \u2014 surging call volume activity, an up movement in the stock, and rising implied volatility levels.\n\nBloomberg\n\nThe funny thing is that when Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet stopped, Tesla (TSLA) picked it up on June 26. With a surging stock price, sharply rising implied volatility levels for an at-the-money 30-day option, and call volume surging.\n\nBloomberg\n\nOn July 5, it seemed to be Meta's (META) turn because it appears to have been neglected for the most part. The stock jumped by nearly 6 percent, saw its implied volatility increase, and saw call volume rise more than double.\n\nBloomberg\n\nThis is happening as the S&P 500 has continued to climb, and an at-the-money 1-month implied volatility for the index continued to move lower with spiking on a few occasions, above the usual range.\n\nBloomberg\n\nA Quarterly Game\n\nTypically, we think about a gamma squeeze when considering a surging stock price, rising call volume, and increasing implied volatility. However, when we couple the rolling gamma squeezes across multiple names in the S&P 500 as implied volatility for the index is falling, it has the elements of a volatility dispersion trade, which has been noted before.\n\nThis trade is the most notable around earnings season, repeating seasonal and quarterly patterns. Typically, the implied volatility levels for these stocks rise about a month before earnings due to earnings risk and then drop sharply once earnings have passed.\n\nLast year, this trade in Meta started around the end of June, with IV flattening out around July 6. It also coincided with a sharp rise in call volumes beginning on July 5 and then coming down slowly. The stock price rose from around $285 to $325 then. However, after the results, IV crashed, and the stock returned to around $285 over the next couple of weeks.\n\nBloomberg\n\nThis pattern repeats about every quarter, starting one month before the earnings season begins and ending once earnings are reported.\n\nBloomberg\n\nCorrelations At All-Time Lows\n\nThis is why the 1-month implied correlation index has pushed on to new lows, falling below 4, and is now trading nearly three handles below its previous all-time lows set in 2017/18. This indicates that the current implied volatility across the 50 largest companies in the S&P 500 and index implied volatility levels are not moving in the same direction, and the lower the value, the weaker the correlation.\n\nBloomberg\n\nHowever, once implied volatility levels in the stocks peak, the implied correlation index will form a local bottom and, in most cases, turn higher. This would indicate that some kind of local bottom in the 1-month implied correlation is due very soon, with the potential for a turn higher.\n\nBloomberg\n\nThe 3-month, 9-month, and 12-month implied correlation indexes often flatten out or turn higher before the 1-month implied correlation indexes. This has happened many times over the past year alone. The 3-, 9-, and 12-month indexes could already be near a turning point.\n\nBloomberg\n\nBlurred Vision\n\nBut this rotation into these differing stocks due to this trade is why we see this endless rotation in mega-cap names with big moves. It is noticeable, too, when breaking down the movements and the weightings of the stocks over those preferred time frames. From June 20 until June 26, the Bloomberg 500 shows that the stocks with the biggest impacts in the index, a proxy for the S&P 500, were Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, with Tesla in fourth. This was over a stretch where 229 stocks were higher while 261 were lower.\n\nBloomberg\n\nThe period between June 27 and July 3 saw Tesla's share surge, leading to the Bloomberg 500's rise, followed by Apple and Microsoft. Tesla's shares surged by more than 25% in that small trading window, adding more than $130 billion in market cap. During a period where the 257 stocks were higher and just 242 stocks were lower.\n\nBloomberg\n\nOn July 5, Apple and Meta led the tracking proxy higher, contributing 50% of the day's gains, with Meta up nearly 6%. This was in the midst of a massive gamma squeeze, as the number of stocks higher was just 257, with 241 down.\n\nBloomberg\n\nOverall, the Bloomberg 500 gained about 1.6% from June 20 through July 5, during which 252 stocks moved higher and 249 stocks moved lower. This was mainly due to what appears to be a volatility dispersion trade among a handful of the largest stocks in the market.\n\nBloomberg\n\nSo again, if it seems you are seeing things with a stock de jour weekly, you are not. It is accurate, and there is a reason for it.\n\nThis trade is very close to its end because of the seasonal cycles.",

    "title": "Sonoco Products Stock: Selloff Is Overdone, Buy To Lock In 4.2% Yield (NYSE:SON)",
    "body": "bunhill/E+ via Getty Images\n\nWith markets currently sitting at all-time highs, it may be prudent to increase allocations to defensive sectors like consumer staples, health care and utilities. One of the challenges with the consumer staples segment is picking the right brand or product category. Sonoco Products Company (NYSE:SON) is a packaging supplier to many of the leader consumer products companies around the globe. Why not get broad exposure to consumer staples without the risk of choosing a single brand or category while collecting a growing dividend and 4.2% yield?\n\nRecently, the shares have sold off from a high of $61.50 to just under $50 on news that the company is acquiring Eviosys, a private equity owned company that was acquired from Crown Holdings (CCK) in 2021. I think the selloff is too steep, and the shares offer a compelling valuation.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nSonoco has been an innovator in packaging technology for 125 years and as a proof point, they have received over 500 patents just since 2020. The company produces four categories of packaging, and they focus on the segment of the broader packaging industry that is considered value-add. This means that they are not just a raw material paper supplier or steel producer, which are relatively more prone to commodity price cycles.\n\nSonoco 2024 Investor Day Presentation\n\nAfter the close of the Eviosys acquisition, the combined company will generate about $9.2 billion in revenue. Rigid paper containers will constitute about 16% of revenue, metal packaging 38%, flexibles and thermoforming 14%, and industrial paper packaging 27%. The remaining 5% is \"other\" and is a variety of packaging materials including plastic, paper, foam, and various other specialty materials.\n\nWhy The Market Is Sour On Eviosys Acquisition\n\nThe selloff in SON shares actually started prior to the acquisition announcement, so we can't attribute all of the downturn to this. That said, shares opened -2.3% on the day of the announcement (June 24th) and traded as low as -5.7%. They've continued to drift lower to where they are now down about -10.6% since the acquisition news. Clearly, the market does not like the deal, and we need to understand why.\n\nSonoco is paying $3.9 billion and funding it via the sale of $2.7 billion in new bonds, issuance of $500 million of common equity and a $700 million term loan. Management also communicated that they will be raising $1 billion of cash from divesting non-core businesses, including the Thermosafe business. Depending on the timing of the sale of these businesses, management said that they may not need the $700 million term loan, but that even if they do, they expect to pay it off in 3 months.\n\nSonoco - Eviosys M&A Call Presentation\n\nMore debt and share dilution (the bad)\n\nLooking at the new capital structure (after the acquisition and the divestitures) we see that SON will carry 3.6X net debt to EBITDA. The common share count will also increase from 98.3 million to about 109 million (assumes 10 million shares sold at $50 per share for proceeds of $500 million).\n\nI also wonder if the market is skeptical of the strategic rationale for this purchase. While Eviosys does add scale in metal packaging when combined with the metal can business that SON bought from Ball in 2022, would it have been better to find an acquisition in the rigid paper packaging market where management says that the long-term growth rate is higher (see above graphic)?\n\nAccretive to earnings, cash flow, and no impact to investment grade rating (the good)\n\nManagement's strategic case for the acquisition is that it will create a more focused company better able to serve global customers and weighted more heavily towards consumer-oriented end markets (~70%). Financially, they project that the combined company will generate higher EBITDA margins of 17% or more (from ~16% today).\n\nAccretive by 25% to consensus 2025 EPS based on $100 million of cost synergies and increase of $350MM free cash flow in 2025. On the M&A call, the CFO confirmed that the EPS forecast includes the impact of the share dilution.\n\nMoody's and S&P confirm IG rating on close and forecast is that leverage ratio will be under 3.0X in 24 months post close. Notably, the CFO believes that the cost of debt on the new bonds will be in the vicinity of 4.5% (+/-) aided by the fact that they will be euro-denominated, and they will hedge some of the offering.\n\nThe $100 million synergy goal is very conservative in my opinion. Management indicated that a large portion of it will come from enhanced purchasing power and procurement savings, especially in the large steel spend.\n\nCompelling Valuation And Dividend Record\n\nThe \"new\" Sonoco will primarily (81% of revenue) be a metal container and paperboard/rigid paper manufacturer. As such, I've built a set of peers using the comparison tool on Seeking Alpa that you can access here. Sonoco trades at...\n\nLowest forward P/E on a GAAP EPS basis\n\nSecond-lowest forward EV/EBITDA\n\nLowest Price/Cash Flow TTM\n\nSeeking Alpha Comparison\n\nThe valuation discount is not justified by poor performance. Sonoco is in the middle to upper half of the pack on profitability metrics, with a clear path towards hitting 17%+ EBITDA margins.\n\nSeeking Alpha Comparison\n\nIn years past shares have generally traded for over 10 times cash flow with the exception of the pandemic period in 2020 to early 2021. The long-run average for the industry seems to hover around 7 to 8 times cash flow.\n\nSeeking Alpha Charting\n\nAt this depressed valuation, you are paid to wait for operating results to continue improving while collecting a 4.2% dividend yield. Sonoco is the king of dividends in its industry.\n\nAt the current share price, the dividend yield is higher than where it has been during 96% of the past twenty years. I like that management has expressly declared that the \"dividend is foundational\" and that they believe it drives discipline and creates shareholder value. Better yet, 99 years of paying a dividend and 41 years of increasing it bring serious credibility to these statements.\n\nKoyfin Percentile Rank Dataset\n\nOver those 41 years, the dividend has increased at just over 10% compounded annually. While I don't expect that the dividend can continue growing at that rate, I do think a 4% growth rate is very achievable, and it is just a tad lower than the growth rate over the past 5 years. The global population is projected to increase from 7.6 billion to 9.8 billion by 2050 or about 1% annually. Combine population growth with inflation of around 3% and real economic growth on top of that and a 4% dividend growth rate seems conservative.\n\nGrowth Outlook To 2028\n\nThe stock price probably does not show much improvement until management delivers on their goals for the acquisition, namely paying down the debt and increasing operating margins, as well as showing in-line or better revenue growth.\n\nI think management has done a good job streamlining the business, having shed some non-core operations (like timber lands) and reorganizing from +20 business units to the current 4 core ones. At the 2024 Investor Day, management outlined a plan to increase adjusted EBITDA by about 40% to $1.5 billion by 2028. The previously communicated target of $1.5 billion in EBITDA will be revised upward with the acquisition to about $1.9 billion.\n\nThe plan to achieve the higher margins is built on investments in automation, bringing regional back-office shared services into one global center and reducing the number of ERP systems from six to three.\n\nLooking out to 2028, I think the company can earn $760 million and with 109 million shares that translates to EPS of $6.92. Only one analyst on the street provides a 2028 forecast, and it is at $7.44 GAAP EPS. With some improvement in the PE multiple to 12 to 15 times, shares could rise to between $83 and $104. Without any valuation multiple expansion, we still pocket the dividend yield and earnings growth.\n\nSigns Of Selloff Is Nearing The End\n\nThe question is whether this is a value trap or is the floor in for the share price and thus presenting a good entry point? One indication that the floor may be in or that we are near it is that a large institutional buyer seems to have bought the stock on the Friday before the acquisition announcement (which is a little fishy, perhaps). Shares were trading down through a key support level at $56 all day, and then in the last hour volume surged, driving the shares back up over $1 before the close.\n\nTradingView.com\n\nThis pattern of buying in the last 30 minutes of the trading day has continued the past week and I think the shares are stabilizing between $48 and $50 where support has rested in the past too.\n\nRisks And Flags\n\nWe need to watch and see where the cost of debt for the upcoming bond sale prices. If it lands higher than the mid 4% range and/or the company does not maintain its investment grade rating, it is a sign of doubt from the credit market and would definitely impair the stock price.\n\nThere is also a risk that the company is unable to achieve at least $1 billion in proceeds from divestitures of non-core businesses, thus impacting the ability and timing for the company to pay off the $700 million term loan. Right now, the mergers & acquisitions market is fair, in my opinion, and deals are getting done. That could change quickly with a market selloff and if investors move to a risk off sentiment.\n\nThird, while company revenues are geared towards consumer staples end-markets, it is categorized in the materials sector for the market, which is generally viewed as procyclical. Any downturn in the economy could cause broad-based selling of materials stocks, and Sonoco shares could get dragged further down and not benefit from a rotation into consumer staples and other defensive sectors.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a stock for value investors or those who want to rotate into a consumer staples supply chain for defensive reasons given the market conditions right now. It's not often that you get to buy a company that has been paying a dividend for nearly 100 years and continues to increase the dividend for 41 years and counting at a compelling valuation.\n\nIt's also a company that seems to have a reasonably good culture, and my experience is that you don't last for 125 years if you don't treat people well. I like their motto: \"People build businesses by doing the right things\".",

    "title": "Where Will Tesla Stock Be in 5 Years?",
    "body": "Share prices of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are up roughly 21% in five days since it was reported that second-quarter vehicle deliveries beat Wall Street's expectations. However, the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer's longer-term downward trend remains in effect as it grapples with high interest rates, competition, and other macroeconomic factors.\n\nCould the second-quarter deliveries indicate a sustainable recovery, or will Tesla continue fading out? Let's explore what the next five years could have in store for this innovative EV leader.\n\nSecond-quarter deliveries beat expectations -- or did they?\n\nTesla investors don't have to wait until earnings (expected to be released this month) to get updated on the company's performance. Management typically releases production and delivery data along with other vehicle manufacturers on a quarterly basis (it used to be released monthly). And the much-anticipated second-quarter numbers were no exception.\n\nWith 443,956 cars delivered in the second quarter, Tesla beat Wall Street's consensus forecast of 439,000. But this is still down 4.8% from the prior-year period and represents the second consecutive quarter of declining deliveries after a 13% year-over-year drop in the first quarter.\n\nThe better-than-expected delivery numbers sparked a double-digit percentage rally in the stock price, but the automaker is not out of the woods yet. The extent of the weakness could be revealed when the company releases its full quarterly report.\n\nSeveral key problems might come up. First is pricing. Automakers can drive volume growth by lowering prices. But this can come at the expense of revenue per car sold and margins. For Tesla, this could pose a big problem because its previously high margins are the main thing differentiating it from its uninspiring mass-market rivals.\n\nIn the first quarter, its operating margins fell from 11.4% to 5.5%. And continued declines could turn the company into just another automaker.\n\nMusk to the rescue?\n\nWith a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 6.33, its stock trades at a significant premium over the typical large U.S. automaker. For context, Ford Motor Company and General Motors trade for a P/S of just 0.3 and 0.36, respectively. And if Tesla becomes just another car company, it could lose much of its $560 billion valuation. Shareholders are betting that CEO Elon Musk won't let this happen.\n\nFresh off securing an equity-based pay package worth $44.9 billion, Musk is incentivized to do everything possible to boost the stock price. He seems to be downplaying the automotive opportunity in favor of new growth drivers like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nStory continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe company is working on Dojo, a supercomputer designed to help train its machine-learning models for full self-driving (FSD). While Tesla isn't the only company tackling this effort, it has some advantages because of the vast amount of user data it can gather from its customers with FSD software installed in their cars. Musk says its robotaxi will be revealed on Aug. 8, along with its next-gen vehicle platform.\n\nIf the robotaxis are consumer-ready, they could unlock a new nonautomotive revenue stream for Tesla, while putting it in a prime position to explore other AI uses like warehouse automation or possibly even humanoid robots over the next five years and beyond.\n\nIs the stock a buy?\n\nTesla has once again become a highly speculative company. If current trends continue, its previously high-margin EV business could become commodified over the next five years amid rising competition and lower pricing power. This isn't enough to justify the stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 57 compared to the Nasdaq Composite's average P/E of 32.\n\nInvestors who buy the stock now are betting on Elon Musk and his ability to transform the company into more than just an automaker through AI and robotics. This is a tall order. And the controversial executive has a track record of overpromising and underdelivering.\n\nWith that said, Musk has rescued Tesla from the brink on several occasions, so there is good reason for the market to have some faith in him. The stock looks like a hold pending more information.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "The Ultimate Crypto to Buy Hand Over Fist With $1,000 Today",
    "body": "After a hot start to 2024, things have cooled off considerably in crypto over the last couple of months. However, rest assured these types of lulls are common in even bull markets and often provide investors with valuable opportunities.\n\nWhile there are several options out there today, some are more alluring than others. Here is why Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is the ultimate cryptocurrency to invest in today.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSome simple math first\n\nFrom a holistic view, it's easy to see why Ethereum takes the title of the ultimate cryptocurrency to invest in today. It is arguably one of the most widely used blockchains in the world and boasts an array of innovative use cases, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), borrowing and lending protocols, and stablecoins, just to name a few. Not to mention it is the unequivocal leader of one of crypto's highest potential economies -- decentralized finance (DeFi). Today, more than 60% of the DeFi economy calls Ethereum home, making it an ideal investment to gain exposure to the market's burgeoning potential.\n\nYet, despite its well-known capabilities, compared to other cryptocurrencies Ethereum's price is further off of its previous all-time high. Take Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) for example. Today, Bitcoin sits about 15% off its all-time high of $73,000. As of this writing, Ethereum remains roughly 35% off of its peak price of more than $4,600.\n\nNot only is it a safe bet that Ethereum will eclipse its previous record, but it will likely set a new one as this bull market progresses. As to how high? Only time will tell, but rest assured Ethereum's leading position in DeFi and its vast array of use cases will ensure its price keeps climbing over the years.\n\nEthereum should get a big break soon\n\nNow to focus on a more specific event. It is expected that in the coming weeks (maybe months if things don't go to plan) a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) will get approved. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to get a spot ETF approved, back in January this year.\n\nThere are three reasons an ETF is so important. First, it democratizes access for investors. Buying and purchasing cryptocurrencies on exchanges can be difficult for the technically challenged. But with an ETF it's as easy as buying through of one's preferred brokerage with just a couple of clicks.\n\nSecond, it opens the door for institutional investors. Institutions are already allocating to Bitcoin and now they have their eyes on Ethereum. Known for their deep pockets, the arrival of institutional investors holds the potential to transform Ethereum's value as wealth managers begin to better understand its foundational role in the digital economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast but not least, the spot ETF approval gives Ethereum an unofficial stamp of legitimacy. Right now only Bitcoin can make this claim, but this will soon change and put Ethereum in an exclusive class. While this alone might not cause its price to go higher, it does help provide staying power that is often hard to come by in crypto.\n\nThe road to the spot ETF approval looks to be in sight, but there is still some time and potential obstacles to be cleared before Ethereum gets there. In the meantime, as the rest of the market jostles and struggles to build momentum, I'll be using this time to grab more Ethereum while it trades at a discount relative to its long-term potential. For those with a few extra bucks at their disposal and looking to increase their crypto exposure, few other options stand out as much as Ethereum.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ethereum right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ethereum wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "2 Boring Stocks to Buy Right Now",
    "body": "There's plenty of excitement in the stock market right now as artificial intelligence (AI) technology drives huge gains from some stocks. While investing in AI could be a good idea, it's not the only way to generate solid long-term returns. Don't forget about boring, unloved stocks trading at pessimistic prices.\n\nTwo boring stocks worth buying today are tobacco giant British American Tobacco (NYSE: BTI) and telecom titan AT&T (NYSE: T).\n\nBritish American Tobacco\n\nWhile the tobacco industry may not seem all that exciting, a major transition is currently playing out. Volumes of traditional combustibles, like cigarettes, are in decline, particularly in the United States. However, vaping is surging in popularity. According to YouGov, vape usage among U.S. adults surged nearly 40% between 2019 and 2023.\n\nBritish American Tobacco is betting that demand for newer, non-combustible products can offset slumping demand for standard tobacco products. The company's Vuse brand enjoyed a global value share of 41.1% in its key markets during the first half of 2024 and a higher value share of 51.5% in the U.S.\n\nEven with global tobacco industry volume expected to decline by 3% this year, British American Tobacco expects to generate low-single-digit organic revenue growth and organic adjusted profit growth at constant currency. Pricing power stemming from brand loyalty in the core cigarette business and growth in newer products are pushing up the top and bottom lines despite a tough industry backdrop.\n\nBased on the average analyst estimate for 2024 adjusted earnings per share, British American Tobacco stock trades for less than 7 times earnings. The dividend is also attractive, with a dividend yield that tops 9%.\n\nBritish American Tobacco will never be a growth stock, but with a rock-bottom valuation and a solid plan to continue growing despite waning demand for cigarettes, the stock looks like a great deal.\n\nAT&T\n\nLike British American Tobacco, telecom giant AT&T is not a growth stock. The company's core wireless business is a slow-growing affair. The fiber internet business is growing faster, but offsetting some of that growth is the continual decline of the legacy copper wireline business.\n\nWhile AT&T's revenue growth is sluggish, shifting the business toward higher-margin 5G wireless and fiber internet services can drive free cash flow higher at a faster rate. AT&T has been consistently adding wireless subscribers for the past few years, with 349,000 net postpaid phone additions in the first quarter of 2024. The fiber business added 252,000 net subscribers, increasing fiber revenue by nearly 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAT&T expects to generate free cash flow between $17 billion and $18 billion this year. That's up from $16.8 billion in 2023. Beyond growing the wireless and fiber businesses, the intensity of capital spending will be coming down a bit in the next few years as the 5G investment cycle passes its peak.\n\nBased on the current market capitalization, AT&T stock trades for less than 8 times the midpoint of the company's free-cash-flow guidance range. The stock also sports a nice dividend, although not quite as generous as that of British American Tobacco. Based on the most recent payment, AT&T stock yields about 5.9%.\n\nWith a deeply pessimistic valuation, AT&T stock could be a big winner for investors in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in British American Tobacco right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in British American Tobacco, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and British American Tobacco wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Could Kamala Harris beat Donald Trump in November's presidential race? By Reuters",
    "body": "By Nandita Bose, Jeff Mason and Bianca Flowers\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - She worries Republican donors, has name recognition, and Democratic Party heavyweights are beginning to line up behind her.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris would be President Joe Biden's natural successor if he bowed to growing pressure and stepped aside as the Democratic candidate in the 2024 election, top Democrats say.\n\nNow party donors, activists and officials are asking: Does she have a better chance than Biden of beating Donald Trump? Biden is staying in the race, he has said repeatedly.\n\nHarris, 59, a former U.S. senator and California attorney general, would be the first woman to become president of the United States if she were the party's nominee and prevailed in the Nov. 5 election. She is the first African American and Asian person to serve as vice president.\n\nHer three-and-a-half-year White House tenure has been characterized by a lackluster start, staff turnover, and early policy portfolios including migration from Central America that did not produce major successes.\n\nAs recently as last year, many inside the White House and the Biden campaign team privately worried Harris was a liability for the campaign. The situation has changed significantly since then, Democratic officials have said, as she stepped forward on abortion rights and courted young voters.\n\nSOME POLLS FAVOR HARRIS\n\nRecent polls suggest Harris could do better than Biden against Trump, the Republican candidate, although she would face a tight contest.\n\nA CNN poll released on July 2 found voters favor Trump over Biden by six percentage points, 49% to 43%. Harris also trailed Trump, 47% to 45%, within the margin of error.\n\nIt also found independents back Harris 43%-40% over Trump, and moderate voters of both parties prefer her 51-39%.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll after last week's televised debate between Trump and a faltering Biden found Harris and Trump were nearly tied, with 42% supporting her and 43% backing him.\n\nOnly former first lady Michelle Obama, who has never expressed any interest in getting into the race, polled higher among possible alternatives to Biden.\n\nInternal polling shared by the Biden campaign after the debate shows Harris with the same odds as Biden of beating Trump, with 45% of voters saying they would vote for her versus 48% for Trump.\n\nInfluential Democrats including U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn, the man who was key to Biden's 2020 win; Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York congressman and senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus and Summer Lee, a House Democrat from Pennsylvania have signaled Harris would be the best option to lead the ticket if Biden chooses to step aside.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has also privately signaled the same to lawmakers, a Congressional aide said.\n\nHarris is taken so seriously, two Republican donors told Reuters they would prefer for Trump to face Biden than her.\n\n\"I would prefer Biden to stay in place\" rather than be replaced by Harris, said Pauline Lee, a fundraiser for Trump in Nevada after the June 27 debate, who said she thought Biden had proved himself to be \"incompetent.\"\n\nAnd some on Wall Street, an important Democratic fundraising center, are starting to indicate a preference.\n\n\"Biden is already behind Trump, and is unlikely to be able to overcome that gap given where his campaign is currently. Having VP Harris likely improves Democrats' odds of taking the White House,\" said Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group, a financial services company, after the debate. \"There's potentially more upside for her chances than Biden's at this point.\"\n\nA majority of Americans see Harris in a negative light, as they do both men running for president.\n\nPolling outlet Five Thirty Eight said 37.1% of voters approve of Harris and 49.6% disapprove. Those numbers compare to 36.9% and 57.1% for Biden, and 38.6% and 53.6% for Trump.\n\nWOMEN, BLACK VOTERS, GAZA\n\nSince the Supreme Court repealed women's constitutional right to abortion in 2022, Harris has become the Biden administration's foremost voice on reproductive rights, an issue Democrats are betting on to help them win the 2024 election.\n\nSome Democrats believe Harris could energize Democratic-leaning groups whose enthusiasm for Biden has faded, including Black voters, young voters and those who do not approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"She would energize the Black, brown, and Asian Pacific members of our coalition...she would immediately pull the dispirited youth of our country back into the fold,\" said Tim Ryan, a former Democratic Congressman from Ohio, in a recent op-ed.\n\nDemocratic and Republican suburban women may also be more comfortable with her then Trump or Biden, he said.\n\nAs vice president, Harris's public Israel strategy is identical to Biden's, although she was the first senior leader of the U.S. government to call for a ceasefire in March.\n\n\"Simply swapping out the candidate does not address the central concern\" of the movement, said Abbas Alawieh, a member of the national \"Uncommitted\" movement that withheld votes for Biden in the primary based on his support of Israel.\n\nIf Biden were to step aside, there could be a competition between other Democrats to become the nominee.\n\nIf the party were then to choose another candidate over Harris, some Democrats say it could lose the support of many Black voters who were critical to Biden's election win in 2020.\n\n\"There is no alternative besides Kamala Harris,\" said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of Black voter outreach group BlackPAC.\n\n\"If the Democratic Party thinks that they have problems now with their base being confused... Jump over the Black woman, the vice president, and I don't think the Democratic Party actually recovers.\"\n\nTOO LEFTY?\n\nHowever, Harris may struggle to reel in moderate Democrats and the independent voters who like Biden's centrist policies, some Democratic donors said. Both parties seek independents to help pull them over the finishing line in presidential elections.\n\n\"Her greatest weakness is that her public brand has been associated with the far left wing of the Democratic Party ... and the left wing of the Democratic party cannot win a national election,\" said Dmitri Mehlhorn, a fundraiser and adviser to LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman. \"That is the challenge that she will have to overcome if she is the nominee.\"\n\nHarris would take over money raised by the Biden campaign and inherit campaign infrastructure, a critical advantage with just four months before election day on Nov. 5.\n\nBut any Democratic campaign still needs to raise hundreds of millions of dollars more before November to be successful, strategists say. And there, Harris could be a liability.\n\n\"I can tell you we have a really tough time raising money for her\" said a source at the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAs a presidential candidate ahead of the 2020 election, Harris lagged Biden in raising money. She dropped out of the race in December 2019, the same month her campaign reported $39.3 million in total contributions. Biden's campaign reported $60.9 million in the same period.\n\nHowever, Biden's campaign raised a record $48 million in the 24 hours after he named Harris as his running mate in 2020.\n\nHarris's prosecutorial background could shine in a head-to-head debate against Trump, some Democrats said.\n\n\"She is incredibly focused and forceful and smart, and if she prosecutes the case against the criminality of Donald Trump, she will rip him apart,\" said Mehlhorn.\n\nRepublican attacks on Harris are ramping up as she has been floated as a possible Biden replacement. Conservative talking heads are re-circulating criticism leveled at her during the 2020 race, including from some Democrats, that Harris laughs too much, that she is untested, and unqualified.\n\nKelly Dittmar, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said the attacks are part of a long history of objectifying and denigrating women of color in politics.\n\n\"Unfortunately the reliance on both racist and sexist attacks and tropes against women running for office is historically common and persists to this day,\" said Dittmar.",

    "body": "Investing.com -- The first half of 2024 was marked by an artificial intelligence-driven jump in stock markets, volatility in bond yields, and political uncertainty, according to analysts at UBS.\n\nSo what does the third quarter have in store for investors? In a note to clients on July 1, the analysts outlined several key themes they will be focusing on during the current three-month period.\n\nFirst, they said that while they believe the momentum of the AI boom will remain strong in the coming months, many are wondering about the staying power of a tailwind that has lifted a relatively small number of stocks related to the nascent technology.\n\nPart of this worry, they added, stems from a recent dip in shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) after the AI-poster child touched a record high level and briefly became the world's most valuable company by market capitalization in June.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, the analysts said the AI segment \"currently offers the best mix of attractive and visible earnings growth profiles, strong competitive positioning, and a reinvestment runway.\" As a result, they are particularly bullish on semiconductor firms.\n\nOutside of AI, the analysts also predicted that the Federal Reserve will likely begin to ratchet down rates in the second half of 2024.\n\nMinutes released earlier this week from the Fed's June policy gathering showed that officials were reticient to begin to slashing interest rates down from a more than two-decade high range of 5.25% to 5.5% until they had seen more evidence of waning inflation. However, the analysts argued that data on both inflation and economic activity \"have been supportive of a loosening in financial conditions.\"\n\nThey are predicting that the Fed will roll out two rate cuts this year, with the first in September.\n\nIn terms of specific asset classes, the analysts added that they view gold as a hedge against ongoing geopolitical tensions and \"election-related fears around factors like Fed independence.\"\n\nThey projected that gold prices will rise to $2,600 per ounce by the end of the year and $2,700 an ounce by mid-2025. was trading at $2,364.07 per ounce at 06:48 EST (10:48 GMT) on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, they said there is now an \"attractive entry point\" for investors looking to move into fixed income from cash prior to an expected decline in yields stemming from the Fed's anticipated rate cuts.\n\n\"If the Fed pivots in September, as we expect, U.S. Treasuries should rally as the market shifts its attention to the magnitude of rate cuts not only this year, but also next year and beyond,\" the analysts said.\n\nFinally, U.S. politics will be a key theme for markets, especially after a disastrous debate performance by President Joe Biden last week cast doubt over his ability to stay in the race for reelection. At the moment, polls suggest that the November vote will result in a so-called \"red sweep\", with Donald Trump regaining the presidency and Republicans taking control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nIn such a scenario, the analysts recommended having \"sufficient exposure to financials\", noting that these companies would benefit from conservative lawmakers lowering industry regulations. On the other hand, they expressed some caution around consumer discretionary and renewable energy names, saying they \"could lag\" in the event of a red sweep.",

Sameer Al-doumy | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFrance's left-wing New Popular Front coalition on Sunday unexpectedly thwarted a far-right advance, clinching the largest number of seats but falling short of an absolute majority in a parliamentary run-off vote, early data showed. The New Popular Front \u2014 an alliance of five parties ranging from the far-left France Unbowed to the Socialists and the Ecologists \u2014 could secure between 180 and 215 seats in the latest electoral round, according to an IFOP estimate for French broadcaster TV 1. Ipsos projected a lead of between 172 to 192 seats for the faction. French President Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble party and its allies were set to gain between 150 and 180 seats, according to IFOP, while far-right Rassemblement National \u2014 which won the first round of elections and was widely seen as likely to retain a strong momentum in the runoff vote \u2014 seen in third place with 120-150 seats. None of the parties have accrued the necessary absolute majority of 289 seats to rule alone, suggesting markets could open on Monday to a hung parliament in Europe's third-largest economy, if the Sunday results are confirmed. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, part of Macron's Ensemble party, on Sunday stated his intentions to step down, following the results. \"Faithful to the Republican tradition and in accordance with my principles, tomorrow morning I will submit my resignation to the president of the Republic,\" Attal said, according to a CNBC translation. \"I know that, in light of the results of this evening, many French people feel a certain uncertainty about the future, as no absolute majority has emerged [in parliament]. Our country is experiencing an unprecedented political situation,\" Attal added.\n\nwatch now\n\nLudovic Subran, chief economist at Allianz, told CNBC on Sunday that \"France rejected the extreme right, [and] now needs to peel off the ... leftist part and build center left for tomorrow to reassure markets.\" An initial ballot last Sunday suggested RN would become the largest party in France's National Assembly but, in the last week, factions on the center-right and left joined forces to try to block its advance, withdrawing candidates in many constituencies where another candidate was better placed to beat the far-right party. By offering voters a starker choice and fewer candidates, RN's opponents hoped that the electorate would choose the non-RN candidate. The move appears to have worked, with anti-RN voters galvanized into action. Turnout in the second ballot was a higher 67.1%, the highest since 1997, pollster Ipsos said. \"The chief of state must bow and admit this defeat. The prime minister must leave,\" Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the France Unbowed party, said in a CNBC-translated social media update after the release of the early poll data. \"Mr. Macron must call on the NFP to govern. It is prepared to apply its agenda all of its agenda, nothing but its agenda.\" He added that the party had \"tirelessly\" fought Macron's policies for the past seven years. \"We refuse any combination with the presidential camp,\" Melenchon said, in a separate CNBC-translated post. Melenchon has become a figurehead of the NFP, although the alliance does not have an official leader. France Unbowed is viewed as the biggest party in the bloc although the party's far-left stance has dented its appeal among some center-left voters. A period of horse-trading and instability is now likely to take hold in France, as political alliances are forged with the aim of forming a government, but it's unclear to what extent President Macron will be willing to work with the left-wing alliance.\n\nwatch now",

    "body": "US President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the Supreme Court's immunity ruling at the Cross Hall of the White House in Washington, DC on July 1, 2024.\n\nTwo Democrats with a powerful network of friends are circulating a proposal for President Joe Biden to bow out of the 2024 race and launch an expedited Democratic primary to choose a new nominee before the August convention.\n\nRosa Brooks, a Georgetown University law professor who previously served in both the Obama and Clinton administrations, and Ted Dintersmith, a high-dollar Democratic donor, co-authored the proposal, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC. Semafor was first to report the memo.\n\nThe proposal comes as pressure builds on Biden to exit the race following his stumbling debate on June 27 against former President Donald Trump. The president's debate performance triggered alarm bells for Democratic strategists, lawmakers, donors and voters, escalating lingering concerns about Biden's age and ability to beat Trump.\n\nBrooks said that she and Dintersmith initially sent the memo on Tuesday to dozens of powerful Democrats, including significant donors, Biden appointees and campaign officials.\n\nAs Brooks put it in an interview with CNBC, they sent the plan to \"Everybody who we thought might have the ear of anybody who has any influence over the president's decision-making.\"\n\nThe proposal lays out several key steps, beginning with Biden announcing that he will exit the race in mid-July in a \"speech for the ages,\" as the memo's authors envision it.\n\n\"Overnight, Biden is hailed as a modern-day George Washington, not an octogenarian clinging to power with a 37% approval rating,\" the proposal reads. \"From goat to hero.\"\n\nThe next phase of the plan is a \"blitz primary,\" where prospective Democratic candidates submit their bids and delegates of the Democratic National Convention ultimately narrow down the list to six contenders.\n\nThe hypothetical accelerated primary would involve a massive social media content campaign to engage voters, including forums between the candidates moderated by celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Taylor Swift or Stephen Colbert, according to the memo.\n\nBrooks and Dintersmith's vision ends with delegates voting on the final nominee at the DNC, which would theoretically benefit from boosted viewership and donations from the viral hype of the preceding blitz primary.\n\nBrooks, who noted that she is not a political strategist, said that the proposal should be treated as more of a living document and that many of the details of the plan have changed as the Democrats who saw the memo hypothetically toyed with its ideas.\n\n\"We know we're not in any position to define what actually happens, but we're so encouraged by the uniform reaction: 'Wow! If something along these lines happened, America would be lifted up from our current doldrums,'\" Dintersmith said in an email to CNBC.\n\nSince initially sending the proposal on Tuesday, Brooks said they have received dozens of responses, most of which liked the plan, even if it has a slim chance of actually being executed.\n\n\"The tone has very much been, 'Oh my God, this is probably impossible, but what a great idea,'\" Brooks said.\n\nShe added that the more time that goes on, the more she feels that people are beginning to see the plan as viable: \"It's gone, in a few days from, 'Oh, this would be so great if only it could happen, but it probably can't,' to 'Why can't it?'\"\n\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposal.",

    "body": "Ridvan_celik | E+ | Getty Images\n\nEmployment scams surged last year, as criminals leveraged artificial intelligence to steal money and personal information from unsuspecting job seekers, experts said. Consumer reports of job scams jumped 118% in 2023 from the prior year, according to a recent report by the Identity Theft Resource Center. Thieves generally pose as recruiters and post fake job listings to entice applicants, then steal valuable information during the \"interview\" process. Often, they put these phony listings on reputable websites like LinkedIn and other job search platforms, ITRC said, making it tough to disentangle truth from fiction.\n\nThe typical victim loses about $2,000\n\nA chief danger is divulging information about financial accounts or sensitive personal data (like a Social Security number) that criminals can then use to steal a job seeker's identity. Consumers reported losing $367 million to job and business opportunity scams in 2022, up 76% year over year, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The typical victim lost a \"whopping\" $2,000, the FTC said.\n\nwatch now\n\nJob scams aren't the most prevalent fraud: They accounted for only 9% of total identity scams in 2023, second to Google Voice scams, which totaled 60%, ITRC said. (Google Voice scams trick people into sharing a Google verification code, which scammers can use for nefarious ends. They often target people on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace.) However, employment scams are an \"emerging\" threat, said ITRC president and CEO Eva Velasquez. \"Job scams have been around since there were jobs,\" Velasquez said. \"[But] they'll continue to grow because of a number of external factors that are occurring.\"\n\nAI and remote work fuel job-scam growth\n\nAI advancements are one of those factors: They allow scammers to generate job listings and recruitment messages that look and feel more legitimate, experts said. \"AI tools help refine the 'pitch' to make it more believable as well as compensate for cultural and grammar differences in language usage,\" according to the ITRC report. What's more, the rise of remote work during the pandemic era have made workers and job seekers more comfortable with digital-only transactions, Velasquez said. Job seekers may never see a physical person during a phony hiring or interview process: They may interact with a supposed recruiter only via text or WhatsApp message, Velasquez said, which amounts to a \"big red flag.\" Recent college grads, immigrants or other people new to the U.S. workforce may think such digital-only hiring normal, especially for fully remote jobs, she said. But hiring generally doesn't work this way, she added.\n\nHow job scams can rip you off\n\nCon artists will \"push you for money\" during the hiring process, the FTC said. They may send an invoice for advance payment of on-the-job equipment (like a computer ) or job training. They promise to reimburse you, but won't, according to the federal agency. Scammers may also ask for your personal information \u2014 like a driver's license, Social Security number or bank account details \u2014 upfront in order to fill out \"employment paperwork,\" the FTC said. More from Personal Finance:\n\nWhy job skills could make or break your next interview\n\nWhy a five-day return to office is unlikely\n\nJob market is still strong but has 'gotten competitive' \"Scammers will promise you a great job, but what they really want is your money and your personal information,\" New York Secretary of State Robert Rodriguez said in a consumer alert this year. Job seekers should not expect to have to hand over personal information until after they've received and accepted a job offer, Velasquez said. (While this is a good screen for legitimacy, it may not provide a safety guarantee in all cases, she said.)\n\nHow to protect yourself from job scams",

Our country is experiencing an unprecedented political situation,\" Attal added\n\nHis departure was widely expected in the wake of the first presidential vote, when analysts had circulated the possibility that Macron would have to concede the prime minister's office to RN leader Jordan Bardella, if the far right retained its advance.\n\n\"From the beginning of this campaign, I was alerted to three risks: the risk of an absolute majority dominated by the France Unbowed, the risk of an absolute majority dominated by Rassemblement National, and the risk of the disappearance of a movement that embodies our ideas and our values,\" Attal said Sunday night. \"These three risks, today, were discarded by the French people. Tonight, no absolute majority can be led by the extremes.\"\n\nIn light of the run-off results, Attal set the scene for a period of transition for France's political landscape:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, this evening, a new era begins.

    "body": "Investors are grappling with a host of mixed signals as recent data suggests the economy may be softening and the S&P 500 surges to new highs.\n\nAs investors navigate this complicated environment, they may turn to research from top-rated Wall Street analysts as they search for stocks with strong balance sheets and solid growth prospects.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\n\nMicron Technology\n\nChipmaker Micron Technology (MU) is this week's first pick. The company recently reported beats on the top and bottom lines for the fiscal third quarter, thanks to the demand induced by the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) wave. Management is confident about the road ahead and expects to generate record revenue in fiscal 2025, backed by artificial intelligence-driven opportunities.\n\nReacting to the results, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a buy rating on MU stock and increased his price target to $158 from $138. The analyst sees the post-earnings pullback in the stock as a good opportunity for investors to build a position. He expects AI-driven demand and a disciplined supply to fuel better-than-consensus earnings growth in calendar year 2025.\n\nThe analyst highlighted several reasons for his bullish investment thesis, including market share gains in the lucrative high-bandwidth memory space and AI compute growth in Micron's data center business and edge computing.\n\nHari pointed out that Micron generated free cash flow of $425 million in the fiscal third quarter, marking a rebound from several quarters of negative FCF. He added that the company \"remains committed to driving positive cash flow in FY4Q and into FY2025, even considering the material increase in capex that is expected in FY2025.\"\n\nHari ranks No. 25 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 29.2%. (See Micron Technical Analysis on TipRanks)\n\nAmazon\n\nWe move to e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). Recently, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney reaffirmed a buy rating on AMZN stock with a price target of $225 following his firm's 12th Annual U.S. Online Retail survey, which involved 1,100 respondents.\n\nHighlighting the survey results, Mahaney said that Amazon continues to be the market leader in the U.S. online retail space, with its dominance reflecting in three vital shopping metrics that his firm tracks \u2013 price, selection and convenience. However, he cautioned that the survey indicated a mixed competitive backdrop for Amazon Retail, especially with rival Walmart (WMT) displaying notable improvement in the selection and convenience metrics.\n\nMahaney noted that AMZN remains three to four times ahead of its closest rival across all the three key metrics. Moreover, the company continues to improve its score in satisfaction, which increased 2% year-over-year to 84% and reflected a significant jump from the 65% bottom seen in 2020. The analyst thinks that the enhanced score is a \"reflection of Amazon's continued focus on improving speed and selection (esp. via the regionalization initiatives).\"\n\nThe analyst also noted that the penetration of Amazon Prime touched a record high of 81%. Attractive features like Prime Video, Free Same Day Delivery, Prime Music and Grocery made the Prime membership more attractive to the survey respondents.\n\nOverall, Amazon remains Evercore's \"No. 1 Large Cap Long,\" with the survey results backing the company's long-term investment thesis. Notably, the survey results supported the analyst's views about three fundamental catalysts in 2024 \u2013 significant acceleration in the growth of Amazon Web Services, rising operating margins of the North American Retail business and solid free cash flow margins.\n\nMahaney ranks No. 20 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 32.2%. (See Amazon Hedge Funds Trading Activity on TipRanks)\n\nTwilio\n\nCloud communications platform Twilio (TWLO) is this week's third pick. The company reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter of 2024, with active customer accounts growing to more than 313,000 as of March 31, from 300,000 at the end of the prior-year quarter. However, shares declined following the results as the Q2 guidance missed estimates and reflected the impact of weak customer spending.\n\nNevertheless, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth recently initiated coverage of TWLO stock with a buy rating and a price target of $75. The analyst sees the sell-off in the stock as an attractive buying opportunity, backed by his belief that \"TWLO is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing acceleration of AI-driven digital customer engagement.\"\n\nThe analyst expects Twilio to gain from the demand for artificial intelligence-based automated responses that ensure timely and cost-effective customer interaction. He expects the company's continued investment in research and development and the integration of predictive and generative AI into its new products to boost customer adoption.\n\nFeinseth also highlighted Twilio's cutting-edge \"call center as a service\" platform and its industry-leading position in the communications market. He expects the company's cost saving efforts and efficiency measures to drive higher margins and boost profitability.\n\nFeinseth ranks No. 195 among more than 8,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.1%. (See Twilio Stock Charts on TipRanks)",

    "body": "Here's why, if you haven't updated your beneficiaries since you opened your accounts, it's worth checking in ASAP.\n\n\"It's the no. 1 mistake most people make,\" he says. \"They think it's all taken care of. But the beneficiary form overrides the will. Most people don't know that. And they don't update their beneficiary forms.\"\n\nThere is one major exception to the rule, however, and it has nothing to do with the stocks, exchange-traded funds or mutual funds you own. If you aren't regularly checking in to make sure your beneficiaries are up to date, you could be making a costly error, says Ed Slott, a certified public accountant and founder of IRAHelp.com.\n\nAs long as you have a broadly diversified portfolio that matches your tolerance for risk, the thinking goes, not much good can come from worrying about the daily ups and downs of your investments. Instead, sit back, and watch compound interest work its magic over the decades you're invested.\n\nWhen it comes to investing accounts, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, financial pros will generally tell you, the less you look at them, the better.\n\nIn the event of your death, your brokerage or plan administrator distributes your assets to whomever you have designated as your beneficiary. Failing to name a beneficiary at all can result in your loved ones having to duke it out in court in an often lengthy and arduous process known as probate over who receives the money.\n\nTo name a beneficiary, you'll have to log on to your brokerage or plan administrator's website and enter some information about who you want to receive your assets, usually their name, date of birth and, optionally, Social Security number.\n\nThis process generally only takes a couple of minutes, and you likely breezed through it when you opened your accounts. So why check back in? Because your situation may change. And if you die before changing your beneficiary designations, the wrong people may get your savings.\n\nSlott cites the recent case of Jeffrey Rolison, who enrolled in the Procter & Gamble 401(k) plan in 1987, naming then girlfriend Margret Losinger (nee Sjostedt) as his beneficiary. The couple broke up in 1989.\n\n\"Over the years, they sent reminders to him. 'We're going digital \u2014 we're moving beneficiary forms online. Do you want to make a change?'\" Slott says. \"Over all those years, he never changed it.\"\n\nSo when Rolison died in 2015, a woman he broke up with decades before received about $750,000 he'd saved in his account. His estate contested the inheritance, and lost.\n\nTo avoid a similar fate for your loved ones, Slott recommends updating the beneficiaries on all your accounts at least once per year. \"You should also have your antennas up when there's what I call a life event,\" he says. \"A birth or death. A marriage or a divorce. A new grandchild, a change in the tax law. These are things that should be looked at.\"\n\nBeneficiary designations typically supersede a will or trust and are often paid out directly by your brokerage or plan provider to the person or people you designate. And make sure you find a way to give the people you name a heads up. In the case of Fidelity, for instance, \"beneficiaries must contact Fidelity themselves to receive their assets,\" company policy reads. \"We'll distribute your assets to your beneficiaries without requiring a will or other legal documents.\n\nWant to be a successful, confident communicator?

    "body": "Participants gesture as they stand with a giant banner which reads as \"France is the fabric of migration\" during an election night rally following the first results of the second round of France's legislative election, at Place de la Republique in Paris on July 7, 2024. Emmanuel Dunand | Afp | Getty Images\n\nInitial indications on Sunday evening for the French parliamentary run-off vote threw up some big surprises, leaving political commentators contemplating a \"hung parliament\" scenario that could prove challenging for both policymaking and financial markets. France's left-wing New Popular Front coalition is seen by some projections to gain the most seats in the election, with French President Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble party and its allies in second place, and with the far-right Rassemblement National coming in third. With none of the groups expected to hit the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority, gridlock could ensue over the coming weeks. The euro slipped about 0.3% against the U.S. dollar in thin trading on Sunday evening after the exit polls were released. In the run-up to the second round vote, analysts at Citi warned that stock markets may be slightly too optimistic about the French election and that \"higher-probability outcomes\" such as a deadlock \"would imply somewhere between 5-20% lower equity market valuations.\" \"Combined with our finding that French equities tend to be more volatile than peers' around elections, this could be reason to expect additional choppiness from here ... For context, a 10% move in French equities is usually accompanied by an 8% move by the overall Stoxx 600 ,\" the analysts said in a note dated June 26.\n\nwatch now\n\nAnalysts at investment firm Daiwa Capital Markets also spoke of uncertainty if no single party managed to gain an absolute majority. In a research note earlier this week, the analysts said a grand coalition of the moderate left and center parties, a unity government or a minority government were all feasible outcomes. \"Regardless, uncertainty about the outlook for French policymaking is likely to be long-lasting,\" the analysts said.\n\nConcerns on spending\n\nThe tax and spending plans of the left-wing New Popular Front and the hard-right Rassemblement National (RN, or National Rally) party have been a key cause of concern since the snap election was announced. France is facing a challenging fiscal position, and the European Commission announced two weeks ago that it intended to place France under an Excessive Deficit Procedure due to its failure to keep its budget deficit within 3 percent of gross domestic product. An EDP is an action launched by the European Commission against any EU member state that exceeds the budgetary deficit ceiling or fails to reduce their debts. \"A fractious parliament means that it will be difficult for any government to pass the budget cuts that are necessary for France to comply with the EU's budget rules and put its public debt on a sustainable path,\" Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said in a note immediately after the exit pols were released.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"The chance of France's government (and the governments of other countries) clashing with the EU over fiscal policy has increased now that the bloc's budget rules have been re-introduced and several countries \u2013 including France and Italy \u2013 are set to be put into Excessive Deficit Procedures,\" he added.\n\nBond rout\n\nJitters have spread through France's bond market in recent weeks. The premium on the country's borrowing costs compared to those of Germany has recently been trading at its highest level since 2012. France's benchmark 10-year government bond yield has also risen above 3.3%, roughly a 12-month high, since the snap election was called by Macron in the middle of June. David Roche, president and global strategist at Independent Strategy, said in a note Sunday that the early indications of a win for the left-wing alliance could actually be worse economically than a National Rally government. He said that any relief at avoiding a far-right RN outright victory will be short lived and recommended shorting French government bonds versus German bonds \"where the spread is only 70 basis points.\" Shorting involves betting that the price of an asset will fall.\n\nwatch now",

    "body": "If you still doubt the power that the biggest stocks have over this market, Friday's performance should dispel it: Meta Platforms added $29.95, or 5.8%, bumping its gain this year to more than 52.8%. Amazon rallied $2.41, or 1.2%, and is now up roughly 31.6% in 2024. Alphabet increased $4.78, or 2.5%, for a year-to-date return of more than 36.6%. Microsoft put on $6.79, or 1.4%, and is up 24.8% for the year. Apple tacked on $4.79, or 2.1%, to give it a 17.9% gain. They are simply staggering gains for these mega-cap tech stocks in the portfolio. Sure, Nvidia shed a few bucks on Friday as the chipmaker continues to adjust to its 10-for-1 split. But the stock is still up 154.1% for year. By comparison, the broad-based S & P 500 index is up 15.7%, while the more tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 22.2%. Put aside for a moment that we also own Eli Lilly . Shares of the drugmaker rose $16.47 (1.8%) on Friday, bringing its total gain for the year to 57.4% \u2014 despite a vicious and gratuitously political attack by President Joe Biden. Biden, who has waged a not-so-subtle war on pharma since taking office, on Tuesday called on Lilly and Novo Nordisk to cut the prices of their weight-loss and diabetes drugs. This is a triumph of titan tech over everything, everything in the world. How much of this rally is based on the strength of recent earnings versus a belief that earnings will not dissipate if gross domestic product slows with a concomitant decline in inflation? The latter is something the June consumer price index (CPI), which comes out Thursday, could prove dispositive. The answer is that these tech giants \u2014 plus Lilly because of its explosive GLP-1 franchise that's way out in front of its competition \u2014 are viewed as triumphant regardless of the economy's direction. They are sainted. Plain and simple. Unlike the world of sports, Wall Street is a place of theses. We may think, for example, that there are elite teams within the purity of the National Football League. We ascribe their successes to management teams placing the best players on the field and moving them correctly. We don't say they have a secular wind at their backs. On Wall Street, we have to attribute gains to something more than management's skill in putting the best products on the field and then moving them correctly. We don't say: Apple's business is much better than we thought. We say that Apple can transcend the economy because its consumer business is so strong that its colleagues \u2014 not competitors but colleagues \u2014 will shower it with the AI they have spent billions of dollars to build. The only question is which AI company will pay Apple the most to access the 2.2 billion active users of its devices because enterprise isn't big enough to continue its dominance. These are companies that invent amazing franchises \u2014 YouTube, Reels, Amazon Web Services, Copilot \u2014 that can manage the obstacles of a slowdown. There are a few others. Costco and Walmart are both up about 34% this year by capturing the zeitgeist of a frugal consumer in an economic squeeze. Of course, there's the effervescent Tesla , the unsinkable brainchild of Elon Musk, once again back in the black, sheerly out of a cult of personality. How dare anyone doubt his alchemy? But the theses, the endless theses. They are almost novelistic \u2014 more fantasy than fact \u2014 in discrediting the ability of the best to get better. They keep coming back to one main point: You can't have these companies dominate without something bad happening to the stock market. The lack of a belief that the ascension of these stocks is actually good for the market is a given. Do you ever hear: Thank heavens for these stocks? Nah, it's all about the impossibility of their ability to continue to dominate without a decline of some magnitude \u2014 perhaps a decline of great magnitude. Let me present a different, factual manifesto: The companies with these amazing gains are companies that just don't stop inventing. There is never a moment when something new isn't working for them. Their stocks beat the averages because their businesses, based on innovation and not financial engineering, transcend the innovations of others. Is it really a fluke that the most inventive of pharmaceutical companies rivals the performance of the lower capitalized of these mega-caps? I don't think so. There's a two-fold pernicious nature to the denigration of a market based on the advances of a sainted few. The first is that these stocks have gotten ridiculously overvalued. And the second is that no one in his or her right mind would invest in a market dominated by a handful of stocks. Let me attack these two points. The first one is true to some degree. How did Apple tack on such a high multiple (34 times earnings) when we are used to 23 times at best? The triumph of the consumer market over the enterprise. But the multiples of Alphabet and Meta in the mid-20s don't seem that expensive. What are we supposed to pay for the best of the best in Amazon and Microsoft other than twice the market multiple and then a tad more? I don't know. Like Nvidia, they might turn out to be cheap on next year's numbers. Or we just don't know how to value them so we just pay the max amount, like court-side NBA tickets or a box on the fifty-yard line. Far more important to me: Why the heck does it matter to the overall market? If you have most of the new money indexed, what do you expect? Every new dollar is in more than quarters to these companies. You want them to become smaller? Then you need index money to come out of the market. But we all accept that most indexed money is sticky, if not epoxied, to the S & P 500. So what's the deal? Why not complain about passive investing as the culprit and not some non-existent cult of the titan? You know my bias: These are the best in good times and bad. But their incredible market caps have much more to do with \"money in\" than with some sort of freak scenario that will be undone by events or Treasury auctions like the 10-year and the 30-year we have this week. In that sense, I have had to adopt a \"quit your complaining\" view of their strength, lest I feel compelled to sell them. You could argue that the Club's strength is an insistence that we not be bound to faux dogma about these stocks. The Circes won't stop. Strap yourself to the mast for tomorrow's round of \"unsustainable.\" I will, once again, ask myself why the Club is anomalous. Why do so many people have to be driven from the market because of concentration if it can be justified by invention and flows of funds? Isn't it enough to say the sheer mental acuity is enough to justify superiority and superiority means a bigger piece of a growing pie even if some of the multiples have gotten out of whack versus revenues? So once again, temptation to take profits will be there. And once again, that temptation, justified by the fictional thesis of a market collapsing under the weight of the mega-caps, or a Samson-like ETF, must be resisted. Or ask yourself: Hasn't the complaint been front and center for many years? Has it ever been right? With that the defense of the status quo rests. Let the prosecution begin anew, perhaps with some sort of new theory, or perhaps, with no theory at all save \"this can't possibly last.\" On rebuttal, I would say not only could it last, but look for others to join in.

    "body": "Expats living in the U.S. say the best part of living here is having plenty of career opportunities, but for many, a high cost of living makes it a challenging experience.\n\nThe U.S. ranks as the No. 35 best country for expats out of 53 global countries, according to the latest Expat Insider report from InterNations, the global community for people who live abroad.\n\nThe report, which considers survey responses from more than 12,500 expats around the world, covers their satisfaction across five broad indices: quality of life, ease of settling in, working abroad, personal finance and \"expat essentials\" like the ability to find housing and navigate the local language.\n\nOut of these indices, the U.S. ranks highest for \"working abroad.\"\n\nThe U.S. stands out for its local job market and career prospects for expats, according to survey respondents. Expats say the local business culture supports flexibility, and 65% of people are happy in their job, compared with 60% of people who feel the same way globally.\n\nHowever, foreigners say American work culture isn't great. Expats working full time in the U.S. say they work an average of 43.7 hours per week, versus the 42.5 hours global average. They also point to limited vacation time as a factor that negatively impacts their experience.\n\nOutside of work, about half, 52%, of expats in the states say they're dissatisfied with the overall cost of living, compared with 39% of expats who feel similarly around the world.\n\nThe biggest financial barriers are the costs of housing, health care and transportation, especially in areas without a robust public transit infrastructure where people must rely on cars. Only 31% of expats in the U.S. say they're happy with their living expenses, versus 40% globally.\n\nNewcomers say Americans are friendly overall but also express difficulty making friends and settling into a social life.\n\nOverall, expats in the U.S. rate the country highly for its robust digital access (ranging from high-speed internet to the use of digital payments), ease for navigating the local language, leisure options, and a welcoming culture.\n\nThe average expat in the U.S. is about 48 years old, according to the InterNations survey data. Their top reasons for moving here are to attend school or university (16%), because they were sent by their employer (12%), or because of their partner's job (10%). For those working in the U.S., they're most likely to work in finance, health care or information technology.\n\nThe top countries for expats this year, meanwhile, are Panama, Mexico and Indonesia, according to InterNations.\n\nWant to land your dream job?

    "body": "Millennials and Gen Zers are taking advantage of their off-days and weekends by \"bed rotting\" \u2014 a trend that involves spending the entire day under the comfort of their duvets while sleeping in, watching television or mindlessly scrolling a device. It's meant to be their way of decompressing or staving off burnout after a long work week, but the trend could be doing more harm than good, according to Samantha Boardman, a psychiatrist and clinical instructor at Weill-Cornell Medical College and author of the book \"Everyday Vitality, Turning Stress Into Strength.\" \"It's very tempting,\" Boardman tells CNBC Make It. \"But the reality is, many people after they engage in some extended period of bed rotting, they don't feel that much better. If anything, they feel a little bit more drained.\"\n\nWhy bed rotting could be doing more harm than good\n\nBed rotting could potentially disrupt your circadian rhythm, your body's natural alarm clock that tells you when to sleep and wake, Boardman says. If you've ever had a rot day, or just slept in longer than normal, it may have left you feeling groggy and less refreshed or made it harder to fall asleep at a reasonable time at night. Getting enough sleep is important to your health. But too much sleep is also associated with many health issues, including heart disease, obesity and depression, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Similarly, research shows that extended time staring at your phone or TV screen can cause eye strain, sleep disturbance and poor mental health. When you're sleeping too much, binge watching a new series or getting lost in social media, you aren't engaging in true rest, Boardman says. You're merely distracting yourself from whatever problem is at hand, be it exhaustion from work, a stressful problem or an unhealthy lifestyle.\n\nBetter ways to recharge",

Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Sunday.\n\n\"The clock is ticking,\" Murphy, a close ally of the president, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"This is going to be a really important and vital week for the country and for the President.\"\n\nSince Biden's fumbling debate performance on June 27, the chorus of Democratic lawmakers, strategists and donors calling on him to bow out of the presidential race has only grown louder. And while voter polls have delivered mixed results, several have shown the president falling further behind Trump.\n\nThe week ahead is crucial with the House and the Senate back in session after a holiday recess, giving Democrats the chance to discuss their concerns in person. Five House Democrats so far have publicly called on Biden to drop out of the race, but more lawmakers have expressed worry behind closed doors.\n\nAs the drop-out pressure mounts, Biden has been in damage control mode as he staunchly pledged to remain in the race.\n\nOn Wednesday, five days after the debate disaster, the president held a variety of phone calls and meetings with Capitol Hill allies, Democratic governors and campaign staff to reassure them of his commitment to the race and ability to win.\n\nOn Friday, Biden did an unedited, 22-minute sit-down with ABC News, his first televised interview aimed at reversing some of the damage of his debate flop. But the interview did little to ease voter concerns, Murphy said.\n\n\"Friday night's interview did not answer all the questions that people in my state have,\" he added. \"They need to see more from the President and I hope that we see that this week.\"\n\nAlso on Friday, Biden made a campaign stop in the key battleground state of Wisconsin.

    "body": "Country Star Reveals Real-Life Miracle He Saw Amid Addiction, Chaos: 'I Asked God to Help Me'\n\nCountry star T. Graham Brown was always a \u201cbeliever in Jesus,\u201d but, over time, he sort of \u201cdrifted away\u201d from the truth \u2014 that is, until a conversation with himself and God ushered in a real-life miracle.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nBrown, 69, told Fox News he was baptized early in life and was \u201calways \u2026 a believer in Jesus.\u201d But, as time went on, he found himself on the wrong path, struggling with addiction and mental health issues.\n\n\u201cI was always taught about Jesus, and I don\u2019t think even in my drunkest days, I don\u2019t think I ever missed saying my prayers at night,\u201d he once told Jesus Calling. \u201cI don\u2019t really remember ever not doing that: I\u2019ve always said my prayers.\u201d\n\nBut the chaos kept progressing. At one point, he was pouring vodka into his coffee in the morning \u2014 just one of the signs he was no longer in control.\n\nEventually, it all came to a head.\n\n\u201cOne morning \u2014 and this is a clich\u00e9 of a story \u2014 but I\u2019d been trying to get sober,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cI\u2019d get on the horse and ride for a while, then fall off. I\u2019d get on the horse, ride awhile and fall off. I went to rehab. That didn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Brown had an honest conversation with himself and the Lord one morning around 14 years ago that everything came together.\n\n\u201cI think I was ready, and I can remember it like it was yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked in the mirror and I actually talked to myself. I said, \u2018Man, what are you doing? You\u2019re about to blow everything. You need to straighten up and do something about this, man. You\u2019re smarter than this.'\u201d\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t all Brown proclaimed. He also made a request of God.\n\n\u201cAnd I asked God to help me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know, from that instant \u2014 I have not had one craving.\u201d\n\nUnderscoring how incredible this development truly was, the country crooner said he went from looking for a buzz around the clock to never even thinking about it.\n\n\u201cI got to call that a miracle,\u201d he said, noting he now has a clear mine. \u201cThis has just been wonderful.\u201d\n\nBrown has been making country music for decades.\n\nIn 1998, over a decade into his career, he made his first connection with Christian audiences when he released \u201cWine Into Water,\u201d a song detailing his struggles with alcohol. That song has been recorded by more than 100 artists, according to his biography.\n\nCountry music singer T. Graham Brown remembers his friend Naomi Judd for her openness about mental health struggles.\n\n\n\n\"I've been there... you go to this severe depression where, I've sat there and looked at a pistol. I've had those suicidal thoughts too.\" pic.twitter.com/xiyxvQAsdt \u2014 Brianna Keilar (@brikeilarcnn) May 2, 2022\n\nBrown has also been open about his struggles with depression and bipolar disorder. Speaking about his late friend Naomi Judd, who took her own life in 2022, he told CNN about his own battles.\n\n\u201cI can tell you exactly what she\u2019s facing, because I have the same problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve sat there and looked at a pistol. I\u2019ve had those suicidal thoughts, too.\u201d\n\nRead Brown\u2019s full story over at Fox News.",

    "title": "Texas braces for Beryl as storm threatens to regain hurricane strength before making landfall",
    "body": "Beryl began lashing Texas with rain and intensifying winds Sunday as coastal residents boarded up windows, left beach towns under evacuation orders and prepared for the powerful storm that has already cut a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Carribean.\n\nAlthough Beryl remained a tropical storm Sunday as it churned toward Texas, it threatened to potentially regain hurricane strength in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall early Monday. The storm was projected to come ashore in the middle of the Texas coast around Matagorda Bay, an area about 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Houston, but officials cautioned the path could still change.\n\nTexas officials warned the storm would cause power outages and flooding but also expressed worry that not enough coastal residents and beach vacationers in Beryl\u2019s path were heeding warnings to leave.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that kind of trigger our concern a little bit, we\u2019ve looked at all of the roads leaving the coast and the maps are still green,\u201d said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is serving as the state\u2019s acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is travelling overseas. \u201cSo we don\u2019t see many people leaving.\u201d\n\nAlong the Texas coast, many residents and business owners took the typical storm precautions, but also expressed uncertainty about the storm\u2019s intensity.\n\nIn Port Lavaca, Jimmy May fastened plywood over the windows of his electrical supply company and said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the possible storm surge. He recalled that his business had escaped flooding in a previous hurricane that brought a 20-foot (6-meter) storm surge.\n\n\u201cIn town, you know, if you\u2019re in the low-lying areas, obviously, you need to get out of there,\u201d he said.\n\nFarther down the coast in Freeport, Mark Richardson, a 64-year-old retiree, said homeowners were busy \u201ctrying to tie everything down\u201d and worried that Beryl had people unsure about where along the Texas coast it would make landfall. He spent Sunday morning on the beach and said ocean swells were quickly rising.\n\n\u201cThe ocean is getting very angry, very fast,\u201d he said.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic\u2019s record warmth.\n\nThree times in its one week of life, Beryl has gained 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.\n\nBeryl\u2019s explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm shows the literal hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean, and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said.\n\nTexas officials warned people along the entire coastline to prepare for possible flooding, heavy rain and wind. The hurricane warning extended from Baffin Bay, south of Corpus Christi, to Sargent, south of Houston.\n\nBeryl lurked as another potential heavy rain event for Houston, where storms in recent months have knocked out power across the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city and flooded neighborhoods. A flash flood watch was in effect for a wide swath of the Texas coast, where forecasters expected Beryl to dump as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain in some areas.\n\nPotential storm surges between 4 and 7 feet (1.22 and 2.13 meters) above ground level were forecast around Matagorda. The warnings extended to the same coastal areas where Hurricane Harvey came ashore in 2017 as a Category 4 hurricane, far more powerful than Beryl\u2019s expected intensity by the time the storm reaches landfall.\n\nThose looking to catch a flight out of the area could find that option all but impossible as Beryl closed in. Hundreds of flights from Houston\u2019s two major commercial airports had been delayed by midafternoon Sunday and dozens more canceled, according to FlightAware data.\n\nIn Corpus Christi, officials asked visitors to cut their trips short and return home early if possible. Residents were advised to secure homes by boarding up windows if necessary and using sandbags to guard against possible flooding.\n\nTraffic was nonstop for the past three days at an Ace Hardware in the city as customers bought tarps, rope, duct tape, sandbags and generators, employee Elizabeth Landry said Saturday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just worried about the wind, the rain,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re wanting to prepare just in case.\u201d\n\nThe White House said Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had sent emergency responders, search-and-rescue teams, bottled water, and other resources along the coast.\n\nSeveral coastal counties called for voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas that are prone to flooding. Local officials also banned beach camping and urged tourists traveling on the Fourth of July holiday weekend to move recreational vehicles from coastal parks.\n\nBeryl earlier this week battered Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane, toppling trees but causing no injuries or deaths before weakening to a tropical storm as it moved across the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nBefore hitting Mexico, Beryl wrought destruction in Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados. Three people were reported dead in Grenada, three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in Venezuela and two in Jamaica.\n\nBeryl would be the 10th hurricane to hit Texas in July since 1851 and the fourth in the last 25 years, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.",

    "title": "Euro falls as France\u2019s left wing looks to score stunning election victory, raising fears of more spending and deeper deficits",
    "body": "The euro fell after initial projections in France\u2019s legislative elections pointed to a shock victory for the leftist alliance, whose campaign for a sharp increase in government spending risks unsettling investors.\n\nThe common currency slipped 0.3% to around $1.0807 at the start of the session in Asia as traders began to digest an outcome they\u2019d largely written off just days ago, and has the potential to reignite a tumultuous few weeks for markets.\n\nInitial projections show the New Popular Front, which includes the Socialists and far-left France Unbowed, is poised to get between 170 and 215 seats in the National Assembly. Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally \u2014 which had been widely expected to win the most seats \u2014 is seen coming in third, after President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance.\n\nWhile money managers have spent the last week or so fretting over a Le Pen-dominated government, the left\u2019s success will likely still concern markets, given it amounts to a fresh dose of uncertainty in the euro-area\u2019s second-largest economy and because the cohort is committed to a broad easing of fiscal policy.\n\nThat would exacerbate fears over France\u2019s already-bloated balance sheet and put the nation on a collision course with the European Union, which is already taking action to curb the budget deficit.\n\n\u201cFrench politics confounds yet again,\u201d said Geoffrey Yu, senior strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. \u201cBased on the results, risks of expansionary fiscal policy remain, and perhaps on the margins have picked up.\u201d\n\nWhile the left alliance is unlikely to win an absolute majority \u2014 potentially limiting how much it can do \u2014 the result could roil French assets in the coming days.\n\nFrench markets plunged into a tailspin in June, wiping out billions of euros from stocks and bonds as Macron\u2019s snap poll prompted concern that the far-right would take power. But over the past week, traders pared a chunk of those losses as opinion polls indicated that the National Rally would fall short of an outright majority. France\u2019s CAC 40 Index last week erased about half of the losses it endured in the aftermath of Macron\u2019s announcement.\n\nThe picture painted by initial projections Sunday night is very different: Macron\u2019s centrist party \u2014 favored by investors \u2014 is on track for second place, despite a poor showing in the first round of voting. The outcome could leave the president in a position to cobble together a centrist coalition.\n\nStill, the inevitable political wrangling, and anxiety about the influence of the left within a hung parliament, could push up the yield on the nation\u2019s 10-year debt \u2014 known as OATs \u2014 pushing the spread over safer German bunds wider once again. That spread had eased to close at 66 basis points on Friday, after rocketing to more than 80 basis points last month \u2014 levels last seen during the euro-area\u2019s sovereign debt crisis.\n\nThe \u201cshocking result\u201d could easily send the spread back above 80 basis points, according to James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities. \u201cRates markets went into the elections with the OAT vs bund spread pricing in a scenario for a hung parliament \u2014 but a hung parliament led by RN not NFP,\u201d he wrote in a note.\n\nFrench bond futures start trading again at 2:10 a.m. in Paris, followed by cash bonds at 8 a.m. and stocks at 9 a.m.\n\nAn absolute majority for the left was identified by investors as the scenario they were most concerned about in the days ahead of the first round of votes. But that possibility was discounted after Le Pen\u2019s National Rally convincingly won the first round. Among its pledges, the left coalition wants to reverse seven years of pro-business reform and hike the minimum wage.\n\nTo implement its policies, the leftist New Popular Front would require nearly \u20ac95 billion ($102 billion) in extra funds per year, six times the spending planned by Macron and his allies and almost double that proposed by the National Rally, think tank Institut Montaigne said before the vote.\n\nFrance is already grappling with a budget deficit that at 5.5% far exceeds the 3% of economic output allowed under European Union rules. The International Monetary Fund predicts that \u2014 without further measures \u2014 debt would rise to 112% of economic output in 2024, and increase by about 1.5 percentage points a year over the medium-term.\n\nS&P Global Ratings downgraded France in late May, highlighting the French government\u2019s missed goals in plans to restrain the budget deficit after huge spending during the Covid pandemic and energy crisis.\n\nVincent Juvyns, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said tensions were likely with reforms spearheaded by Macron now in doubt, potentially hurting the value of French bonds versus their peers.\n\n\u201cMarkets may demand a higher spread as long as the new government hasn\u2019t clarified its fiscal position,\u201d he said. \u201cThe European Commission and rating agencies are expecting 20 to 30 billions of cuts but the government will actually have to deal with a party which want to increase spending by 120 billion.\u201d",

Permits, an indicator of future construction, also fell as high interest rates weighed on housing demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the supply side of the equation has been even more out of whack.

But because it takes years to bring new sawmills on line, a lot of the lumber supply that was commissioned back then is just now coming to market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a classic bullwhip,\u201d Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist who leads Fastmarkets\u2019 wood products team, told Fortune earlier. \u201cThe supply side [responds] in a like manner to demand, and by the time it comes to the market that demand picture is already changed\u2014and in this case in a negative way.\u201d",

    "title": "French left-wing coalition poised for shock victory over Macron\u2019s centrists and Le Pen\u2019s far right in legislative election",
    "body": "A coalition of the French left that quickly banded together to beat a surging far right in legislative elections won the most seats in parliament but not a majority, according to polling projections Sunday, a stunning outcome that threatens to plunge the country into political and economic turmoil.\n\nThe projections put President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance in second, no longer in control of parliament, and the bruised far right in third.\n\nWith no bloc securing a clear majority, France faces uncertainty that could rattle markets and its economy, the European Union\u2019s second-largest, and cast a shadow of political instability over the Paris Olympics opening in less than three weeks.\n\nFinal results are not expected until late Sunday or early Monday in the highly volatile snap election that redrew the political map of France even before votes were cast, galvanizing parties on the left to put differences aside and join together when Macron announced just four weeks ago that he was dissolving parliament and calling the election, in a huge gamble that the president hoped would shore up his centrist alliance.\n\nIt does not appear to have paid off for the deeply unpopular president. Projections forecast that his alliance would no longer be the largest single group in parliament, possibly by a long way. The National Rally party of Marine Le Pen greatly increased the number of seats it holds, but fell far short of its hopes of securing an absolute majority that would have given France its first far-right government since World War II.\n\nIn Paris\u2019 Stalingrad square, supporters on the left cheered and applauded as projections showing the alliance ahead flashed up on a giant screen. Cries of joy also rang out in Republique plaza in eastern Paris, with people spontaneously hugging strangers and several minutes of nonstop applause after the projections landed.\n\nJordan Bardella, Le Pen\u2019s 28-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who\u2019d been hoping to become prime minister, rued that the outcome of the vote \u201cthrows France into the arms of the extreme left.\u201d\n\nThe most prominent of the leftist coalition\u2019s leaders, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, urged Macron to invite the New Popular Front coalition to form a government. The alliance, he said, \u201cis ready to govern.\u201d\n\nThe projections, if confirmed by official counts, will spell intense uncertainty for a pillar of the European Union, with no clarity about who might become prime minister \u2014 and the prospect that Macron will be forced to govern alongside someone opposed to most of his domestic policies. The results will influence the war in Ukraine, global diplomacy and Europe\u2019s economic stability.\n\nThe polling projections are based on the actual vote count in select constituencies.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would resign but also that he would remain on an interim basis during the Olympics or for as long as needed, given that there could be weeks of negotiations to choose a new premier.\n\nIn a statement from his office, Macron indicated that he wouldn\u2019t be rushed into inviting a potential prime minister to form a government. It said he was watching as results come in and would wait for the new National Assembly to take shape before taking \u201cthe necessary decisions,\u201d all while respecting \u201cthe sovereign choice of the French.\u201d\n\nA hung parliament with no single bloc coming close to getting the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority in the National Assembly, the more powerful of France\u2019s two legislative chambers, would be unknown territory for modern France.\n\nUnlike other countries in Europe that are more accustomed to coalition governments, France doesn\u2019t have a tradition of lawmakers from rival political camps coming together to form a majority.\n\nMacron stunned France, and many in his own government, by dissolving parliament after the far right surged in French voting for the European elections in June.\n\nMacron argued that sending voters back to the ballot boxes would provide France with \u201cclarification.\u201d The president was hoping that with France\u2019s fate in their hands, voters might shift from the far right and left and return to mainstream parties closer to the center \u2014 where Macron found much of the support that won him the presidency in 2017 and again in 2022. That, he hoped, would fortify his presidency for his remaining three years in office.\n\nBut rather than rally behind him, millions of voters seized on his surprise decision as an opportunity to vent their anger.\n\nIn last weekend\u2019s first round of balloting, voters backed candidates from the National Rally, in even greater numbers than in voting for the European Parliament. The coalition of parties on the left took second and his centrist alliance was a distant third.\n\nThe sharp polarization of French politics \u2013 especially in this torrid and quick campaign \u2013 is sure to complicate any coalition-building effort. Racism and antisemitism marred the electoral campaign, along with Russian disinformation campaigns, and more than 50 candidates reported being physically attacked \u2014 highly unusual for France. The government said it deployed 30,000 police for Sunday\u2019s runoff vote \u2013 an indication of both the high stakes and concerns that a far-right victory, or even no clear win for any bloc, could trigger protests.\n\nAny cobbled-together majority risks being fragile, vulnerable to no-confidence votes that could cause it to fall.\n\nProlonged instability could increase suggestions from his opponents that Macron should cut short his second and last term. The French Constitution prevents him from dissolving parliament again in the next 12 months, barring that as a route to possibly give France greater clarity.",

    "body": "While Americans are already burdened with massive student loan debts that will take decades to pay off as the cost of education continues to grow, schools have been hiking tuition.\n\nBut a report Tuesday from Fitch Ratings said recent increases at private colleges and universities still weren\u2019t enough to keep pace with rising expenses.\n\nLast fiscal year, the median adjusted operating margin fell to its lowest point in over a decade, according to the ratings agency. That\u2019s even as schools\u2019 investment levels and support from their endowments was relatively steady. And the outlook doesn\u2019t appear any better.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, additional operating pressure is expected through with many institutions grappling with elevated costs and a fractured enrollment environment,\u201d Emily Wadhwani, senior director at Fitch, said in a statement.\n\nCash flow will likely face more pressure, especially as problems with the FAFSA student aid process earlier this year add to concerns about fall enrollment, she said.\n\nAfter two years of declines, fiscal 2023 saw an improvement in net tuition and fee revenue, according to the report. But the median hike was still well below pre-pandemic levels and not enough to offset inflation.\n\nAs a result, Fitch-adjusted operating margins fell in all rating categories to a median of negative 1.7% across the portfolio of schools. That also reflects the first full year since fiscal 2019 with little to no federal institutional aid.\n\nThere\u2019s also a big divide among private schools, the report said. Those with the highest debt ratings\u2014in the AAA and AA categories\u2014saw an increase in student fees as a percentage of total revenues, but lower-rated schools did not.\n\nSo while margins at AAA and AA colleges dipped, they remained healthy and were even higher than in any of the three years preceding the pandemic, Fitch noted. For schools with lower ratings, however, the reverse was true.\n\n\u201cSector bifurcation will continue to widen the credit gap between larger, more selective institutions versus their smaller, less selective and more tuition-dependent counterparts,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn other words, elite schools that boast big endowments and wealthy donors are less vulnerable than the other schools that rely more on tuition revenue and suffer from more volatile enrollment.\n\nThe report comes weeks after the abrupt closure of the University of the Arts in Philadelphia amid plunging enrollment and \u201csignificant, unanticipated expenses.\u201d\n\nIn fact, private colleges have been closing at a rate of about two per month, according to the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.\n\nThat\u2019s as the total number of U.S. college students had been decreasing for years, even before the pandemic sparked a sharp drop in enrollment.\n\nPublic colleges and universities are under similar pressures, as the number of students enrolled in those schools plunged to 10.2 million in 2023, down 12% from a 2011 peak.\n\nAs a result, tuition and fee revenue net of financial aid fell 3.3% in 2023 to an average of $7,353 per full-time student, according to a report from the State Higher Education Executive Officers\u2019 Association, marking the largest decline going back to 1980.",

    "title": "Fed rate cuts: Expect 200 points of easing as economy slows more sharply",
    "body": "Get ready for a bonanza of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve that starts in a few months and extends all the way into next summer, according to analysts at Citi Research.\n\nIn a note on Friday, the bank cited fresh signs of a slowing economy for its view that the Fed will trim rates by 25 basis points eight times, starting in September and extending to July 2025.\n\nThat will lower the benchmark rate by a whopping 200 basis points, or from 5.25%-5.5% now to 3.25%-3.5%, where they will remain for the rest of 2025, the note said.\n\nThe economy has cooled off from its \u201cheady\u201d pace in 2023 with inflation resuming its slowdown after some unexpected stickiness, said Citi analysts led by chief U.S. economist Andrew Hollenhorst.\n\nBut the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s service-sector gauge, which abruptly reversed into negative territory, and the monthly jobs report, which showed unemployment rising to 4.1%, have raised the risk of a sharper weakening of economic activity and a faster pace of rate cuts, they added.\n\nThe data along with dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday suggest the first rate cut will very likely come in September.\n\n\u201cA continued softening of activity will provoke cuts at each of the subsequent seven Fed meetings, in our base case,\u201d Citi predicted.\n\nThe note also pointed to other signs of weakness in the jobs report. While the headline payroll gain of 206,000 appears solid, prior months were revised down. And June saw a decline of 49,000 temporary services jobs, with Citi calling it \u201cthe type of decline that is typically seen around recessions as employers begin reducing labor with the least strongly attached workers.\u201d\n\nPayroll data are also likely skewed to the upside, leaving the unemployment rate, which is derived from a separate survey, as the more important metric, it said. And on that front, Citi pointed to the \u201cSahm Rule\u201d recession indicator and said it could be triggered in August if unemployment continues to rise at its current pace.\n\nHollenhorst has been a relative contrarian this year by maintaining a dimmer view on the economy, even as the Wall Street consensus shifted to a soft landing.\n\nIn May, he doubled down on his warning that the U.S. is headed for a hard landing and that Fed rate cuts wouldn\u2019t be enough to prevent it. That followed a similar forecast in February, even amid blowout jobs reports.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday, Hollenhorst noted that a sharp recession would likely produce enough political consensus for more government spending to stimulate the economy, overcoming concerns about the massive deficit. But a more mild recession may not result in such a consensus, he added.\n\nHe also pointed out that just as Fed rate hikes slowed the economy less than anticipated, rate cuts have not stimulate as much. In addition, 10-year bond yields, which serve as benchmarks for a wide range of borrowing costs, are already below 2-year yields, leaving less room for further downside, especially as rising deficits and inflation add upward pressure.\n\n\u201cMost economic activity is going to be more responsive to a 5-year yield, the 10-year yield. It\u2019s not really about the overnight policy rate,\u201d Hollenhorst explained. \u201cSo there really are questions about how much can you transmit that stimulative effect of lower policy rates.\u201d",

The size of purchases has been a big focus and question mark for the market, as they can be delayed or not reported fully.\n\nA large number of central banks still planned to buy gold in the coming year, spurred by heightened geopolitical and financial risks that make owning the metal more attractive, according to a recent survey by the WGC. About 20 planned to raise their holdings, according to the survey, which didn\u2019t disclose which nations expect to buy.\n\nIndia has been a major buyer of gold in recent years, alongside countries such as China and Turkey.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India also moved 100 tons of its gold from the UK back to its domestic vaults, the Times of India reported in May.",

The person asked not to be identified discussing a projection that has yet to be made public.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest black eye for the missile program, which is being managed by Northrop Grumman Corp. to replace the 1970s-era Minuteman. The Sentinel is a key element of the effort to modernize the US nuclear force and counter growing arsenals held by Russia and China, but its cost projections have steadily grown.\n\nAlthough the new ICBM has substantial support in Congress, the fresh estimate may further embolden arms control advocacy groups who argue that the Sentinel should be scrapped in favor of extending the life of Minuteman III missiles.\n\nThe program will continue but the Pentagon is now assessing the long term implications, include when the first new missiles will be fielded, long-term budget impact and extent of future construction costs, the person said. Pentagon officials are set to brief Congress on the matter next week.\n\nMuch of the cost growth is linked to the program\u2019s Command and Launch segment, which includes the launch facilities and other ground infrastructure for the missiles, according to the person.\n\nIn January, a review found the cost of the Sentinel program had grown by 37% and the missile would go into service two years late, around 2032.\n\nThe Air Force earlier said that the Command and Launch segment of the Sentinel program includes more than 400 new launch facilities, thousands of miles of modern fiber-optic networks, the acquisition of permanent and temporary real estate easements with hundreds of landowners and support of the workforce that will convert the launch facilities from Minuteman III to Sentinel use.",

    "title": "Fraud has reached a \u2018crisis level\u2019 as overseas criminals use romance schemes and grandparent scams to steal life savings",
    "body": "The scammers are winning.\n\nSophisticated overseas criminals are stealing tens of billions of dollars from Americans every year, a crime wave projected to get worse as the U.S. population ages and technology like AI makes it easier than ever to perpetrate fraud and get away with it.\n\nInternet and telephone scams have grown \u201cexponentially,\u201d overwhelming police and prosecutors who catch and convict relatively few of the perpetrators, said Kathy Stokes, director of fraud prevention at AARP\u2019s Fraud Watch Network.\n\nVictims rarely get their money back, including older people who have lost life savings to romance scams, grandparent scams, technical support fraud and other common grifts.\n\n\u201cWe are at a crisis level in fraud in society,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cSo many people have joined the fray because it is pretty easy to be a criminal. They don\u2019t have to follow any rules. And you can make a lot of money, and then there\u2019s very little chance that you\u2019re going to get caught.\u201d\n\nA recent case from Ohio, in which an 81-year-old man was targeted by a scammer and allegedly responded with violence, illustrates the law enforcement challenge.\n\nPolice say the man fatally shot an Uber driver after wrongly assuming she was in on a plot to extract $12,000 in supposed bond money for a relative. The driver fell victim to the same scammer, dispatched to the home midway between Dayton and Columbus to pick up a package for delivery, according to authorities.\n\nHomeowner William Brock was charged with murder in the fatal March 25 shooting of Lo-Letha Hall, but the scammer who threatened Brock over the phone and set the tragic chain of events in motion remains on the loose more than three months later.\n\nBrock pleaded not guilty, saying he was in fear for his life.\n\nAdvantage scammers\n\nOnline and telephone rackets have become so commonplace that law enforcement agencies and adult protective services don\u2019t have the resources to keep up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like drinking from a fire hose,\u201d said Brady Finta, a former FBI agent who supervised elder fraud investigations. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much of it, logistically and reasonably, it\u2019s almost impossible to overcome right now.\u201d\n\nGrifts also can be difficult to investigate, particularly ones that originate overseas, with stolen funds quickly converted into hard-to-track cryptocurrency or siphoned into foreign bank accounts.\n\nSome police departments don\u2019t take financial scams as seriously as other crime and victims wind up discouraged and demoralized, according to Paul Greenwood, who spent 22 years prosecuting elder financial abuse cases in San Diego.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of law enforcement who think that because a victim sends money voluntarily through gift cards or through wire transfers, or for buying crypto, that they\u2019re actually engaging in a consensual transaction,\u201d said Greenwood, who travels the country teaching police how to spot fraud. \u201cAnd that is a big mistake because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not consensual. They\u2019ve been defrauded.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors typically don\u2019t get involved unless the fraud reaches a certain dollar amount, Greenwood said.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department says it does not impose a blanket monetary threshold for federal prosecution of elder financial abuse. But it confirmed that some of the 93 U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices nationwide may set their own thresholds, giving priority to cases in which there are more victims or greater financial impact. Federal prosecutors file hundreds of elder fraud and abuse cases annually.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of frauds go unreported. Often, victims are reluctant to come forward.\n\nA 74-year-old woman recently charged with robbing a credit union north of Cincinnati was the victim of an online scam, according to her family. Authorities say they believe the woman was preyed on by a scammer, yet there is no record she made a formal police report.\n\n\u201cThese people are very good at what they do, and they\u2019re very good at deceiving people and prying money out of them,\u201d said Fairview Township, Ohio, police Sgt. Brandon McCroskey, who investigated the robbery. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people almost want to fist fight the police and bank tellers because they \u2026 believe in their mind that they need to get this money out.\u201d\n\nA devastating scheme\n\nOlder people hold more wealth as a group and present a ripe target for scammers. The impact can be devastating since many of these victims are past their working years and don\u2019t have much time to recoup losses.\n\nElder fraud complaints to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center rose by 14% last year, with losses increasing by 11% to $3.4 billion, according to a recent FBI report.\n\nOther estimates put the annual loss much higher.\n\nA 2023 AARP study calculated that Americans over 60 lose $28.3 billion each year to fraud. The Federal Trade Commission, seeking to account for unreported losses, estimated fraudsters stole a staggering $137 billion in 2022, including $48 billion from older adults. The authors of that study acknowledged a \u201cconsiderable degree of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nIn San Diego, 80-year-old William Bortz said criminals stole his family\u2019s nest egg of almost $700,000 in an elaborate scheme involving a nonexistent Amazon order, a fake \u201crefund processing center\u201d in Hong Kong, doctored bank statements and an instruction that Bortz needed to \u201csynchronize bank accounts\u201d in order to get his money back.\n\nBortz\u2019s scammer was relentless and persuasive, harassing him with dozens of phone calls and, at one point, taking control of his computer.\n\nEven though he was the victim of a crime, Bortz struggles with self-blame.\n\n\u201cI understand now why so much elder abuse fraud is never reported. Because when you look back at it, you think, \u2018How could I have been so stupid?\u2019\u201d said Bortz, who retired after a career in banking, financial services and real estate.\n\nHis daughter, Ave Williams, said local police and the FBI were diligent in trying to track down the overseas scammer and recover the money, but ran into multiple dead ends. The family blames Bortz\u2019s bank, which Williams said ignored multiple red flags and facilitated several large wire transfers by her father over the course of eight days. The bank denied wrongdoing and the family\u2019s lawsuit against it was dismissed.\n\n\u201cThe scammers are getting better,\u201d Williams said. \u201dWe need our law enforcement to be given the tools they need, and we need our banks to get better because they are the first line of defense.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department contends industry needs to do more, saying the U.S. can\u2019t prosecute its way out the problem.\n\n\u201cPrivate industry \u2014 including the tech, retail, banking, fintech, and telecommunications sectors \u2014 must make it harder for fraudsters to defraud victims and harder to launder victim proceeds,\u201d the agency said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nA way forward\n\nBanking industry officials told a Senate subcommittee in May they are investing heavily in new technologies to stop fraud, \u201cand some hold great promise.\u201d The American Bankers Association says it\u2019s working on a program to coordinate real-time communication among banks to better flag suspicious activity and reduce the flow of stolen funds.\n\nBut industry officials said the banks cannot singlehandedly prevent fraud. They said the U.S. needs an overarching national strategy to combat scammers, calling the federal government\u2019s current efforts disjointed and uncoordinated.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies and industry need to join forces to fight fraud more quickly and efficiently, said Finta, the former FBI agent, who launched a nonprofit called the National Elder Fraud Coordination Center to cultivate better cooperation between law enforcement and major corporations like Walmart, Amazon and Google.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very, very smart people and there\u2019s very powerful, wealthy companies that want this to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we do have the ability, I think, to make a greater impact and to help out our brothers and sisters in law enforcement that are struggling with this tsunami of fraud.\u201d",

    "title": "Alaska\u2019s capital, with a population of 32,000, could ban cruise ships on Saturdays as tourists can spike to 18,000 a day",
    "body": "Each year, a crush of tourists arrives in Alaska\u2019s capital city on cruise ships to see wonders like the fast-diminishing Mendenhall Glacier. Now, long-simmering tensions over Juneau\u2019s tourism boom are coming to a head over a new voter initiative aimed at giving residents a respite from the influx.\n\nA measure that would ban cruise ships with 250 or more passengers from docking in Juneau on Saturdays qualified for the Oct. 1 municipal ballot, setting the stage for a debate about how much tourism is too much in a city that is experiencing first-hand the impacts of climate change. The measure would also ban ships on July 4, a day when locals flock to a downtown parade.\n\nThe \u201cship-free Saturdays\u201d initiative that qualified this week will go to voters unless the local Assembly enacts a similar measure by Aug. 15, which is seen as unlikely.\n\nJuneau, accessible only by water or air, is home to the Mendenhall Glacier, a major draw for the cruise passengers who arrive on multi-story ships towering over parts of the modest downtown skyline. Many residents of this city of about 32,000 have concerns about increased traffic, congested trails and the frequent buzz of sight-seeing helicopters transporting visitors to the Mendenhall and other glaciers.\n\nDeborah Craig, who has lived in Juneau for decades, supports ship-free Saturdays. Craig, who lives across the channel from where the ships dock, often hears their early-morning fog horns and broadcast announcements made to passengers that are audible across the water.\n\nThe current \u201coverwhelming\u201d number of visitors diminishes what residents love so much about Juneau, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about preserving the lifestyle that keeps us in Juneau, which is about clean air, clean water, pristine environment and easy access to trails, easy access to water sports and nature,\u201d she said of the initiative.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this perception that some people are not welcoming of tourists, and that\u2019s not the case at all,\u201d Craig said. \u201cIt\u2019s about volume. It\u2019s about too much \u2014 too many in a short period of time overwhelming a small community.\u201d\n\nThe current cruise season runs from early April to late October.\n\nOpponents of the initiative say limiting dockings will hurt local businesses that rely heavily on tourism and could invite lawsuits. A voter-approved limiton cruise passenger numbers in Bar Harbor, Maine, another community with a significant tourism economy, was challenged in federal court.\n\nLaura McDonnell, a business leader who owns Caribou Crossings, a gift shop in Juneau\u2019s downtown tourist core, said she makes 98% of her annual revenue during the summer season.\n\nTourism is about all the \u201clocal businesses that rely on cruise passengers and our place in the community,\u201d said McDonnell, who is involved in Protect Juneau\u2019s Future, which opposes the initiative.\n\nSome schools recently closed due to factors including declining enrollment, while the regional economy faces challenges, she said.\n\n\u201cI think that as a community, we really need to look at what\u2019s at stake for our economy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not in a position to be shrinking our economy.\u201d\n\nThe cruise industry accounted for $375 million in direct spending in Juneau in 2023, most of that attributable to spending by passengers, according to a report prepared for the city by McKinley Research Group LLC.\n\nAfter a two-year pandemic lull, cruise passenger numbers rose sharply in Juneau, hitting a record of more than 1.6 million in 2023. Under this year\u2019s schedule, Sept. 21 will be the first day since early May with no large ships in town.\n\nThe tourism debate is polarizing, and the city has been trying to find a middle ground, said Alexandra Pierce, Juneau\u2019s visitor industry director. But she noted there also needs to be a regional solution.\n\nIf the Juneau initiative passes, it will impact other, smaller communities in southeast Alaska because the ships, generally on trips originating in Seattle or Vancouver, Canada, will have to go somewhere if they can\u2019t dock in Juneau on Saturdays, she said.\n\nSome residents in Sitka, south of Juneau, are in the early stages of trying to limit cruise visitation to that small, island community, which is near a volcano.\n\nJuneau and major cruise lines, including Carnival Corp., Disney Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Group, agreed to a limit of five large ships a day, which took effect this year. They more recently signed a pact, set to take effect in 2026, seeking a daily limit of 16,000 cruise passengers Sundays through Fridays and 12,000 on Saturdays.\n\nPierce said the overall goal is to keep total cruise passenger visitation around 1.6 million, and to even out daily numbers of visitors that can spike to about 18,000 on the busiest days. Peak days in the past have felt \u201ca bit suffocating,\u201d she said. Juneau traditionally has been the most popular cruise port in the state.\n\nA number of projects around Juneau are expected to help make existing cruise numbers feel less impactful. Those include plans for a gondola at the city-owned ski area and increased visitor capacity at the Mendenhall Glacier recreation area, she said.\n\nRen\u00e9e Limoge Reeve, vice president of government and community relations for the trade group Cruise Lines International Association Alaska, said the agreements signed with the city were the first of their kind in Alaska.\n\nThe best strategy is \u201congoing, direct dialogue with local communities\u201d and working together in a way that also provides a predictable source of income for local businesses, she said.\n\nProtect Juneau\u2019s Future, led by local business leaders, said the success of the ballot measure would mean a loss of sales tax revenue and millions of dollars in direct spending by cruise passengers. The group was confident voters would reject the measure, its steering committee said in a statement.\n\nKarla Hart, a sponsor of the initiative and frequent critic of the cruise industry, said the threat of litigation has kept communities from taking steps to limit cruise numbers in the past. She was heartened by legal wins this year in the ongoing fight over the measure passed in Bar Harbor, a popular destination near Maine\u2019s Acadia National Park.\n\nShe believes the Juneau initiative will pass.\n\n\u201cEvery single person who is going to vote has a lived experience and knowledge of how the cruise industry impacts their lives,\u201d she said.",

    "title": "Michael Waweru, the unlikely tax czar who secured Kibaki\u2019s plans",
    "body": "If not for anything else, Michael Waweru, who died yesterday, was known for his unyielding commitment to his duties. As a tax collector, he was a man of principles, and carried out his work with a friendliness.\n\nTax dodgers, who would previously befriend the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Commissioner-General, found a wall that even politicians could not surmount.\n\n\u201cThey tried,\u201d Waweru said during the launch of his autobiography.\n\nBy the time he died on July 6, 2024, this legacy was intact. He stepped on toes as he collected taxes but built KRA as a friendly outfit with the slogan: Kulipa Ushuru ni Kujitegemea. If anyone dropped the baton later, it was not Waweru\u2019s fault. Tax collection, as he would remark, came with discipline. It was also about integrity of the people who manned the institution.\n\nShielded by President Mwai Kibaki \u2013 who never called to protect tax dodgers \u2013 Waweru had found a way to answer back politicians who tested his resolve.\n\nUntaxed goods\n\nAs he found out, Eldoret International Airport had become the platform for importers bringing in untaxed goods. He had to close it down, to the chagrin of importers. First, he ordered that all consolidated cargo should bear the names of individual imports, their Personal Identification Number and addresses. But rather than abide by the rules, some of the importers went to see Deputy PM Uhuru Kenyatta, who was also the Minister for Finance. They had hoped he would help them.\n\nAs Waweru later recounted in his book, The Tax Czar, \u201cUhuru called me and said, \u201cCan you come to my office? I want us to sort out this matter about Eldoret Airport.\u201d\n\nBut he answered without even thinking: \u201cDPM, I am sorry I will not come.\u201d\n\nUhuru was taken aback by Waweru\u2019s response. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cBecause if I come, from now on all tax matters will be resolved in your office and it is not healthy for you.\u201d\n\nWhat Waweru did not say was that he wanted to run the show without politicians. The other call came from Eldoret North MP William Ruto, who had met the same traders. Rather than call, Ruto went with them to KRA. When he was told that some of the seized cargo had chemicals for making addictive drugs, \u201che became restless and looked uncomfortable. He glanced at his watch several times and then abruptly stood up and said: \u2018I was going for another meeting. Please proceed without me\u2019.\u201d\n\nCigarette-making company\n\nAnother person who tried to push Waweru was then-Prime Minister Raila Odinga who had asked him to lift an agency notice against a friend running a cigarette-making company.\n\nWaweru told him: \u201cPrime Minister, you don\u2019t have the power to do that.\u201d\n\nAnd Raila said: \u201cI am the coordinator of government; how come I don\u2019t have the power?\u201d\n\nWaweru\u2019s responded: \u201cEven my minister does not tell me to collect taxes from one person and not another.\u201d\n\nAfter witnessing President Moi\u2019s struggles with the International Monetary Fund, Waweru\u2019s mission was to protect the ailing Kibaki from similar financial pressures. His close associates, including then Head of Civil Service, Francis Muthaura, protected him by doing the donkey-work and letting integrity drive the individuals. Those who misused that freedom ended up in the murky waters of the AngloLeasing scandal.\n\nWaweru\u2019s commitment bore fruit when David Mwiraria, as Finance Minister, presented a budget devoid of donor dependency \u2013 a ground-breaking achievement.\n\n\u201cI felt really nice. We would pick and choose our friends,\u201d he said.\n\nExceeding revenue targets five times in his nine-year tenure, Waweru helped the Kibaki government achieve fiscal independence.\n\nWaweru was hands-on. Every day at precisely 4pm, he would convene a meeting in the boardroom. This daily revenue update was a ritual.\n\nSh635 billion\n\nBy the time he left, the revenue had soared from Sh180 billion in 2002 to Sh635 billion in 2011, underpinning ambitious national projects.\n\nHe had never dreamt of playing such a role as a taxman. When it was thrust to him by President Kibaki, he decided to take the challenge. After 24 years, the Moi regime had run down the economy and tax collection was almost dead. The landscape was fertile with tax dodgers and conmen. KRA was the playground of politicos.\n\nAs he took over from John Munge, he was shown a red line to State House. \u201cIf that rings,\u201d he was told, \u201cIt is from State House!\u201d\n\nBut the phone never rang \u2013 and he never tried to test it until one day when he told businessman Eddy Njoroge (who had been appointed by Kibaki to revamp KenGen) about the phone.\n\n\u201cLet us see if it works,\u201d Njoroge had jokingly said. To their surprise, it was dead. It meant that Kibaki had no direct line to the taxman.\n\nWaweru had known Kibaki for years. While working with Pannel Bellhouse and Mwangi audit firm, Kibaki was one of his clients between 1982 and 1986. As an accountant, he had known most of the Kibaki men at Muthaiga Golf Club.\n\nWaweru\u2019s journey began in the Rift Valley, where his father worked for colonial settler John Harris. His early years were marked by the chaos of the State of Emergency. Fleeing with his mother, Waweru was left to navigate a disrupted childhood as his father was detained. When his father finally returned in 1956, Waweru did not recognise the \u201cstranger\u201d before him.\n\nWaweru etched his name into history as the inaugural graduate from his Nguka village in Mwea. It is this trajectory of firsts that eventually led to his appointment as the KRA boss.\n\nThis role, described by his associates as the true test of his capabilities, was laden with responsibility. Failure would have risked Waweru\u2019s reputation and Kibaki\u2019s legacy.\n\nFormidable company\n\nInitially, Waweru who had left Ernst and Young audit firm had decided to enroll for a Masters degree and later a PhD. That changed when he met Mr Solomon Karanja, who enlisted him in the secretariat of Kibaki campaign. Here, he worked with the likes of Eddy Njoroge, Nat Kangethe, Joe Wanjui and others to craft Kibaki\u2019s manifesto.\n\nAfter Kibaki\u2019s victory, Waweru thought he was done with his duties. Then the call came and it was Prof Nick Wanjohi on the line. Wanjohi\u2019s query was: \u201cWho do you think is going to deliver on the manifesto you have been working on?\u201d This drew Waweru back into public service.\n\nThe rise of TransCentury as a formidable company became the best illustration on building capital. The creation of TransCentury by Kibaki\u2019s allies exemplified the era\u2019s shift towards leveraging positions for entrepreneurial ventures. Just as Heri Limited symbolised Kenyatta-era investments, TransCentury became the nexus for Kibaki\u2019s associates to build a formidable business empire. They bought East African Cables and made billions. They tried their hand at Kenya Railways and burnt their fingers.",

    "body": "The boss of Royal Mail\u2019s parent company has said it will push on with a transformation of the group despite its \u00a33.57bn takeover, as Royal Mail prepares this month to cut more daily freight flights.\n\nMartin Seidenberg, the chief executive of International Distribution Services, plans \u201cthe biggest network change in 20 years\u201d to revamp Royal Mail\u2019s deliveries despite uncertainty created by the Czech energy tycoon Daniel Kretinsky\u2019s takeover, which has been backed by the board.\n\nAs part of the overhaul, Royal Mail is halving its daily chartered flights transporting post around the UK to 18 in an effort to reduce costs and cut its carbon emissions. The company cut the first 11 flights last week and will end another three on 20 July and a further four in early 2025.\n\nThe move, an element of Seidenberg\u2019s strategy after his arrival last year, represents its biggest ever reduction of domestic airmail, saving 30,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year by shifting the post on to the roads and cutting 1.2m air miles. It hopes to hit net zero by 2040.\n\nSeidenberg told the Guardian: \u201cThe flights are part of the wider transformation agenda. Take aside the bid situation \u2013 we had a couple of weeks where we had to focus on that one \u2013 the organisation continues to focus on transformation.\u201d\n\nRoyal Mail shifted the mail from the air to roads in part through an overhaul that has included later shift times of up to 90 minutes in delivery offices, meaning it can move mail by road over longer journey times and still meet next-day delivery targets.\n\n\u201cWe have more time to push the mail through the network by road, enabling us to take the flights out,\u201d said Seidenberg, adding that the change meant some customers such as online retailers could now hand over parcels as late as 1am for delivery that day.\n\nThe flights cut include routes from Stansted to Belfast and Edinburgh, and Inverness to Edinburgh and East Midlands airport (EMA). The 18 flights remaining include journeys between EMA and Belfast and Edinburgh, and Glasgow and the Scottish islands, with flights typically running between 7pm and 4am.\n\nThe 508-year-old company first moved mail by air on passenger services from the south-east of England to Scotland and Northern Ireland in the 1960s, but found their schedules limiting. In 1979 it established a small hub for chartered flights in Speke, Liverpool, rapidly growing from moving 600 postbags to 6,000 daily in just two years.\n\nIn 1992 a second hub at EMA was established, with 15 planes carrying 5,000 bags a night. A dedicated network, Skynet, was established the same year, connecting a matrix of hubs around the UK to allow mail to be moved on fewer, larger aircraft.\n\nBy 2003 the company had ditched some air services as part of a \u00a390m cost-cutting drive, and three years later operations were closed at Liverpool and Gatwick. A later move to limit road speeds of heavy vehicles pushed some mail volumes back into the air.\n\nDuring the pandemic the company began trials of delivering by drone to remote corners of the UK, including the Isles of Scilly and the Shetland Islands. But Seidenberg cautioned that regulations around the technology and its limited capacity meant widespread use of drones remained impractical for a \u201cmass production business\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And we do need to realise that this company is still in transformation. We\u2019re making good progress, but also we need to understand the change hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\n\u201cThis company still needs investment going forward.

    "title": "No rest for the winners: business secretary rushed on to Sunday politics shows | John Crace",
    "body": "The grownups are back in Westminster. The Tory psychodramas inside No 10 have been replaced by a serious Labour government focused on delivery. It\u2019s going to take time for all of us to make the adjustment. Except, time is the one thing Keir Starmer is not going to allow his new cabinet. He knows that the only way to win over those who didn\u2019t vote for him last Thursday is to make an immediate difference. These days even a landslide majority is no guarantee of a second term.\n\nEven so, Jonathan Reynolds, the new business and trade secretary, would probably have liked more than 40 or so hours to get his feet under the desk before being sent out on to the Sunday morning politics shows. I mean, he probably hasn\u2019t even worked out where the nearest toilet is in his department yet.\n\nBut there is no rest for the winners, and Trevor Phillips and Laura Kuenssberg seemed genuinely bewildered that he didn\u2019t have clear answers to every problem Britain faces. What the hell had Reynolds been doing on Saturday? Clearly, masterminding a penalty shootout win in the Euros was not enough. How quickly we take a new government for granted.\n\nAfter a half hearted \u201chow does it feel to be called secretary of state?\u201d \u2013 no need to answer, Jonny \u2013 Phillips cut to the chase. Tony Blair had written a 1,500-word agony aunt column for the Sunday Times giving Starmer advice, in which he had said Labour must deal with immigration.\n\nAlmost as if the former prime minister was a bit narked that someone had got a majority to match his own. Bitter, moi? Perish the thought. Tone had suggested introducing electronic ID cards. At which you began to suspect that he had a financial interest in the AI needed for their development. He\u2019s never been averse to making himself rich. So what was the new government\u2019s plan?\n\nReynolds tried to take it all in his stride. New government, new candour. It was almost as if cabinet ministers had been instructed to try to answer the questions. Nothing Blair could say would ever be unhelpful, he said. Though he could have been a lot more helpful.\n\nIt was like this. The prime minister would be looking very hard at both legal and illegal migration through the prism of the jobs market. Which sounded much more sensible than anything we had heard in the last few years. Though he became rather more vague about ID cards. It was early in the morning and no one had told him what the government line on this was. An hour or so later, he would categorically rule out ID cards in a radio interview. No one could say the new government didn\u2019t get things done quickly.\n\nWe moved on to Brexit and freedom of movement. Just don\u2019t call it freedom of movement. There would be a renegotiation of some of the barriers to trade. Just all done on a nod and a wink. Whatever it takes. Watch this space. Over on the BBC, Kuenssberg wanted to know how he was going to sort out the ongoing dispute at the steelworks in Port Talbot. Quickly, said Reynolds, without giving much away. Though not quickly enough for Laura. She sounded as if she was already disappointed in the new government.\n\nThen to the election itself. How could Labour say it had a mandate when it had only won about 35% of the vote? Both Phillips and Kuenssberg said this as if it was somehow Labour\u2019s fault rather than a consequence of the first-past-the-post system. As if Starmer was personally at fault for having adopted a strategy of trying to win as many seats as possible.\n\nStill, it would have been fun if Reynolds had said: \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re quite right. No one should be in government for the next five years on the basis of last Thursday\u2019s results. What the country had voted for was for No 10 to remain empty for the next five years with nobody doing anything at all. Let the UK burn.\u201d Instead he quite reasonably observed that people had wanted the Tories out and that voters who had backed Reform knew they were likely to get a Labour government and were quite happy with that.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It\u2019s not often that you get one-sixtieth of the Tory parliamentary party on the programme at once. So that was quite the coup for the BBC. And why not? While the Labour party is hellbent on being serious, we mustn\u2019t all lose our sense of humour. So thank God for the Conservatives for providing us with this comedy duo. The idea of a prolonged Tory leadership campaign will be the gift that keeps on giving \u2013 to me, at any rate \u2013 over the coming months. Maybe it will go on for years. The idea of the Tories uniting behind anyone is a category error.\n\nVicky and Honest Bob were adamant they hadn\u2019t agreed to appear on the show because they planned to stand for leader. Absolutely not. That had been the last thing on their minds. They would never have dreamed of coming on if that had been the case.\n\nNo, the reason they were on was because they wanted to be able to look voters in the eye and say: \u201cThank you for not choosing us last Thursday. We always wanted to be humiliated because we had betrayed your trust, so from the bottom of our hearts we are grateful for what you have done.\u201d Which was weird because only last week I could have sworn both had been insisting that the Tories were the only party who could be guaranteed to deliver on their promises.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to show the country that I understand,\u201d said Atkins. VOTE FOR ME. VOTE FOR ME. \u201cWe need to focus on our values.\u201d Just as soon as they\u2019ve discovered what those values are. Assuming they still have any. Honest Bob was hilarious. Someone should give him his own sitcom. Seldom has someone more obviously useless rated himself so highly. \u201cIn politics, you lose as a team,\u201d he said. Just marvellous. From the man who had resigned from Rishi Sunak\u2019s government at the turn of the year for it not being sufficiently rightwing. The only team he has ever been on is his own. And that of the pornographer Dirty Des when there\u2019s planning permission to be granted.\n\nOver on Sky, Phillips was lamenting that no Tory MP would come on his show. Clearly, Atkins and Honest Bob had suddenly taken their lack of leadership ambitions very seriously. Trevor had to make do with Nadhim Zahawi. Neither he nor Phillips could work out why he was on. The never-ending existential crisis for most ex-Tory ministers. So they both sat down to fill out his tax form. Just to make sure there were no mistakes this time round.",

    "title": "Antero Midstream: Solid Business But There Are Better Picks Out There (NYSE:AM)",
    "body": "Art Wager\n\nAntero Midstream (NYSE:NYSE:AM) is a midstream energy operator with a market cap of just over $7 billion. AM portfolio assets are comprised of gathering pipelines, compression facilities, interests in processing and fractionation plants, and water handling systems. AM is also active in establishing joint ventures to grow enter into larger projects without assuming full risk. Here the most notable JV of AM is formed together with MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX), where the underlying operations are around developing and operating large scale processing and fractionation assets.\n\nIf we look at the historical five-year total return performance and compare it with the overall midstream segment, we will clearly see how consistently AM has generated alpha over the relevant index. In the chart below it is evident that really starting from early 2020, AM has assumed a strong and upward-sloping return trajectory.\n\nYcharts\n\nSuch a notable gap in the registered returns could raise a question on whether AM's valuations have gone too far from the underlying value. In fact, relatively recently UBS cut its rating on AM from buy to hold referring to the fact that the risk and reward profile has reached an equilibrium.\n\nMoreover, the current dividend yield offered by AM is not that enticing compared to what we can find in the midstream space. Currently, AM yields only 6.1%, which is circa 120 basis points below the yield of Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEARCA:AMLP) index.\n\nLet's now assess the underlying fundamentals of AM to determine whether it makes sense to go long here.\n\nThesis\n\nAt its core, AM is a rather similar business to its peers such as Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), Enbridge (ENB), Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET), MPLX, etc. The business model is built on durable natural gas infrastructure assets, which enjoy almost a permanent demand profile with the only exceptions in the cash generation stemming from potential operational failures. Other than that, AM is able to generate consistent and periodically growing cash flows that are backed by sound contracts.\n\nThe only aspects that materially distinguish AM from its peers are the following two:\n\n100% of AM's cash generation is underpinned by fixed-fee contracts, thus mitigating the commodity risk factor. As opposed to most of its peers, AM is almost fully focused on natural gas segment, which is inherently more favorable from the valuations perspective (i.e., introduces a greater predictability in the business).\n\nMoreover, as for most of midstream companies, the recent financial performance for AM has been very strong. For example, Q1, 2024 was a record quarter for AM, with the organic growth landing at a 4% and 6% in gathering and processing volumes, respectively, compared to last year. In terms of the EBITDA generation, AM registered a double-digit EBITDA growth, while achieving a double-digit declines in the CapEx spend. As a result of these dynamics, AM landed record free cash flow levels of $182 million and $74 million if we adjust for the dividend payments.\n\nHere the chart below captures nicely how AM has been sticking to a free cash flow focused strategy since Q3, 2022, when it started to consistently register surplus results (after accounting for dividend distributions).\n\nAntero Midstream Investor Presentation\n\nPart of this is obviously driven by the previous CapEx programs coming online and AM's success in organic growth, but one of the key reasons is clearly the reduced CapEx spend.\n\nAntero Midstream Investor Presentation\n\nWhat we can notice in this CapEx related chart is that AM remains rather committed on decreasing the organic CapEx even further, which should per definition leave more liquidity at AM's books to either de-risk the balance sheet or conduct buybacks.\n\nThe commentary in the recent earnings call by Brendan Krueger - CFO of Antero Midstream - offered an interesting color in this regard:\n\nYes. Thanks for the question. This is Brendan. I think as we've talked about on past calls as well, I mean, we look at everything in terms of return and on overall capital. So, as we approach this 3x leverage target, as we mentioned, second half of this year, we'll look to -- it will be positioned us well to buy back shares or pay down further debt or execute for the bolt-on acquisitions. We've got the $500 million program out there, as you mentioned, and we do see attractiveness in our shares still today. So, as we sit here today, share buybacks would continue to make a lot of sense, but we'll certainly evaluate that as we as we hit that 3x target, hopefully, in the second half of this year.\n\nApart from the organic CapEx spend, there is also an M&A component that might temporarily drive the surplus cash generation levels of AM lower. For instance, May this year, AM announced that it has ventured into a bolt-on acquisition of assets in Marcellus Shale at a ticket size of $70 million.\n\nWhile this might introduce some challenge for AM to keep de-risking the balance sheet and / or enjoy growing surplus cash flow levels, we have to keep in mind that fundamentally the M&A transactions are accretive and in AM's case typically of a small scale. Even looking at the comment above by Brendan Krueger, we can see that the management remains committed on bringing the net debt to EBITDA at 3x.\n\nSpeaking of the balance sheet, currently, AM carries a net debt to EBITDA of 3.1x, which is not the lowest level in the sector, but still an indicative of a sound capital structure. On top of this, AM has no debt maturities in 2024 and 2025, and the one, which comes due in 2026 is related to the credit revolver.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAll in all, Antero Midstream business is strong and underpinned by sound financials both from the cash generation and capital structure perspective. The fact that all of the contracts are based on fixed-fee and that the operations are almost fully based in natural gas segments should warrant some premium. While the balance sheet is not the strongest in the sector, the distant debt maturity profile in combination with a focus on de-leveraging render AM interesting also from this angle.\n\nHowever, with all of this being said, I am still hesitant to go long AM. The reason is simple - in general, I agree with UBS's view that the upside potential is largely exhausted. The recent run-up in the share price has pushed the valuations higher accordingly (EV/EBITDA of 12x, which is on the high end in midstream space), making the dividend yield of ~ 6% relatively unattractive.\n\nFor me, there are better midstream alternatives out there, where the dividend yields are higher, balance sheets stronger and growth prospects rather similar to what Antero Midstream has outlined. Below are just three examples, where I have issued buy thesis:",

    "title": "Solventum: Stumbling Out Of The Gate (NYSE:SOLV)",
    "body": "Edwin Tan /E+ via Getty Images\n\nToday, we put Solventum Corporation (NYSE:SOLV) in the spotlight for the first time. This spinoff of the former 3M Company (MMM) healthcare business came public in late March and already has destroyed a considerable amount of shareholder value in its short time as its own public company. The company also looks like it is making a play to acquire Mediwound (MDWD), a provider of non-surgical solutions for tissue repair and regeneration at a large buyout premium whose story I highlighted early in 2024.\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\nWill this potential purchase change the narrative for Solventum? An analysis follows below.\n\nSolventum Corporation kept its headquarters in St. Paul after this spinoff and manufacturer a variety of healthcare products. Solventum has four business segments: Medsurg, Dental Solutions, Health Information Systems, and Purification and Filtration. The stock trades just below fifty bucks a share and sports an approximate market capitalization of $8.6 billion.\n\nRecent Results:\n\nThe company posted its Q1 numbers on May 9th. It was Solventum's first quarterly report as a public company. The company easily bested expectations as it reported non-GAAP earnings of $2.08 a share, this was more than 30 cents a share above the analyst consensus. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $1.37 a share. Revenues came in at $2.01 billion, some $40 million above the median estimate.\n\nMay 2024 Company Presentation\n\nHowever, other than the company's Purification and Filtration business, revenue growth from the firm's other three business segments, was almost exactly flat. That includes Solventum's Medsurg division, where it gets just over half its overall sales. This is the division the acquisition of Mediwound would fit it. The company is expected to deliver $24 million worth of sales in FY2024. At $34/share, Solventum would be paying a bit over $300 million for MDWD. Now the company's launch of NexoBrid in the United States should boost sales significantly, with a recent article on Seeking Alpha pegging sales in FY2026 at right at $70 million. NexoBrid is a topical medication used to remove damaged skin from certain types of serious burn wounds. This Israeli-based company also ended the first quarter with just over $35 million of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet.\n\nMay 2024 Company Presentation\n\nManagement provided the following guidance for FY2024.\n\nMay 2024 Company Presentation\n\nAnalyst Commentary & Balance Sheet:\n\nPrior to the news of the potential purchase of Mediwound late this week, the analyst community has had a big 'thumbs down' on the company. Since Solventum was spun off, six analyst firms including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have put a Hold or Sell rating on the stock. Price targets proffered range from $54 to $73 a share. Not a single analyst firm has offered up a Buy rating on SOLV.\n\nThe company listed cash and marketable securities of just over $965 million within its 10-Q filed for the first quarter. Importantly, the company also noted just over $8.3 billion in long-term debt on the balance sheet as well. Solventum did generate $340 million of free cash flow in the first quarter. One of the primary purposes of this free cash flow will be to pay down debt over the next couple of years.\n\nMay 2024 Company Presentation\n\nSolventum listed $39 million of net interest expense for the quarter. No insider activity in the stock has taken place since the spinoff.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe current analyst consensus has Solventum making $6.24 a share in FY2024 on $8.18 billion in revenues. They see profits falling to $5.51 a share in FY2025 on flat sales growth.\n\nSolventum is hardly expensive at eight times earnings and will produce a free cash flow yield in the high single digits in FY2024 based on management guidance. That said, the P/E valuation is based on Non-GAAP earnings metrics. In addition, there are reasons the analyst community is negative on the equity even at these valuations. The spinoff saddled Solventum with a large chunk of debt. In addition, sales growth is flat, and earnings are projected to decline next fiscal year.\n\nGiven the small revenue involved, the potential purchase of Mediwound is not going to move the needle much for Solventum and the company will be paying north of 12 times revenues at the speculated price of $34 a share. This is a story I might circle back to in the future once the company has paid down a decent amount of its debt load. Hopefully, by then, management will have figured out a way to grow revenues and profits as well.",

    "body": "cagkansayin/iStock via Getty Images\n\nListen below or on the go on Apple Podcasts and Spotify\n\nMajor banks are the start of quarterly results. (0:17) Consumer inflation is expected to fall annually. (3:10) The big thing about Nvidia. (5:37)\n\nThe following is an abridged transcript:\n\nThis week brings the last consumer inflation figures before the Fed meets at the end of the month, but corporate earnings will like drive market momentum.\n\nThe broader market continues to rally but concerns about the breadth of the rally and valuation of the top stocks driving it continue.\n\nGoldman Sachs equity strategist David Kostin said: \"We expect the magnitude of EPS beats is likely to diminish as consensus forecasts set a higher bar than in previous quarters.\"\n\n\"Analysts forecast the mega-cap AI firms will post sales growth of 17% in 2Q year/year. Over a 12-month period, high-growth stocks with elevated multiples historically generated roughly the same 10 pp reward as low-multiple stocks when beating estimates. However, growth stocks with high valuations lagged the median firm by 32 pp when they failed to meet sales estimates, 2x the underperformance of lower multiple stocks.\"\n\nLeading earnings this week are the banking stocks. All 31 major banks just passed their Fed stress tests. Friday brings reports from Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and Wells Fargo (WFC).\n\n\u201cInvestors have no reason to change their bullish outlook on Wells Fargo,\u201d according to Chris Lau, who leads the DIY Value Investing Group \u2013 and you may know from the comments sections of my Wall Street research stories.\n\nLau says Well Fargo\u201dhiked its dividend and will buy back stock. This increases the attractiveness of the stock, especially as the Fed prepares to cut interest rates this year. After building support in the $40s since 2021, the uptrend that began last Nov. 2023 is unlikely to end. Helped by strong quarterly results, that sets up a rally to over $65, a price not seen since Jan. 22, 2018.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the banks, Delta (DAL) and Pepsi (PEP) weigh in on Thursday.\n\nDelta continues to benefit from a premium consumer mix as a best-in-class operator, with diversified revenue and cash streams. Analysts are looking for Delta to reiterate its 2024 guidance for EPS of $6.00 to $7.00 and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. Options trading implies a share price swing of 6% after the report.\n\nPepsi\u2019s organic sales are seen rising by 3%, led by a strong performance in the Europe and Latin America regions. Volume is seen up 4.1% to offset a 1.1% decline in pricing.\n\nUBS says that although the stock has largely traded sideways to start the year, the firm's crowding analysis points to the stock being a crowded long and conversations would suggest sentiment remains negative heading into results due to concerns about challenging U.S. trends.\n\nOther earnings this week include Greenbrier (GBX) on Monday. Helen of Troy (HELE) and Kura Sushi (KRUS) report Tuesday. Manchester United (MANU) \u2013 full of executives and short on players so far -- and PriceSmart (PSMT) weigh in on Wednesday. Conagra Brands (CAG) joins Pepsi and Delta on Thursday, which is also inflation day.\n\nThe June consumer price index is expected to have risen 0.1% on the month, bringing the annual rate down to 3.1%. The core CPI is forecast for a 0.2% rise.\n\nMorgan Stanley says both the CPI and the PCE have confirmed solid economic growth of 2%, which \"amounts to a pretty comfortable soft landing.\n\n\"While markets may be wringing their hands over a slowdown, from the Fed\u2019s perspective it would be most welcome,\" chief global economist Seth Carpenter said. \"In fact, a slowdown at least as big as we expect is probably seen as necessary within the Fed to achieve its goal of extending the current cycle while bringing inflation down.\"\n\n\"After a lull in the (1990s) economy and a very shallow reversal from the Fed, the economy continued to grow for the rest of the decade. Currently, the market is pricing in cuts, and we actually expect a bit more than is priced, but like the 1990s, we think the cutting cycle will be shallow. Investors hoping for a \u201clate cycle\u201d scenario that turns to a rebound where rates are slashed by several hundred basis points may be in for some disappointment.\"\n\nIn the news this weekend, casino operators on the Las Vegas Strip have a near-term earnings catalyst on the horizon, with the closing of the Tropicana Las Vegas and The Mirage Hotel & Casino representing a 4.9% combined reduction in total room supply on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nThe AP notes that when the Tropicana opened in 1957 it was the most expensive and lavish casino on the Strip.\n\nNicknamed the \u201cTiffany of the Strip\u201d it cost $15 million to build, with 300 rooms split into two wings, creating a footprint shaped like the letter \u201cY.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, it had ties to mobster Frank Costello and has been a pop culture staple. It served as the location of Moe Green's hotel in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and in \u201cDiamonds Are Forever,\u201d James Bond says \u201cI hear that the Hotel Tropicana's quite comfortable.\u201d\n\nCBRE Equity Research analysts said the Mirage is the more meaningful contraction. \"We estimate that The Mirage had ~1mm occupied room nights and generated $596M of revenue and $169M of EBITDAR in FY23. This represents significant underlying demand for the Las Vegas Strip that will need to find a home.\"\n\nLooking to the markets, stocks are coming off their best week since April, with heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) snapping a two-week losing streak.\n\nSeeking Alpha's Rena Sherbill spoke to Jonah Lupton, who runs the Fundamental Growth Investor Investing Group.\n\n\"I don't even know what to make of NVIDIA. I mean, I don't think we know what the next three, four, five years is going to look like for artificial intelligence. We don't know their specific roadmap. We don't know what competitors might be coming down the pipeline with their own chips.\n\nI mean, we've all heard stories about the hyperscalers like Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), they're going to want to build their own chips, okay, it sounds good. I don't know if they'll actually be able to do it.\n\nAnd then how will those chips compare to whatever the newest, greatest NVIDIA chip is? And if they're building their own chips, are they going to save enough money by using an inferior chip to justify not using the best NVIDIA chip? Like, I don't know.\n\nI mean, China, ByteDance (BDNCE) is apparently trying to develop their own chips now. I just -- it's wild. I just don't think, I think if you believe in artificial intelligence, I just think this is the one stock that you have to own and you can't try to trade in and out of it because it's going to do things like this, down 6% one day, up 8% the next day.\n\nThank God, I started buying it a year ago when it gapped up on that earnings report. Even though I didn't fully understand the importance of H100s and where that would lead us.\n\nBut now, I mean, you listen to these earnings calls from all the hyperscalers and all they talk about is trying to get their hands on as many H100s as possible, or H200s and the new BGs that are coming out. I mean, Tesla (TSLA) is getting ready to build a supercomputer with Dell (DELL) and Super Micro with tens of thousands of H100s. Like - it's like an arms race, which company can buy the most H100s.\n\nAnd then I don't even know what's going to happen in two or three years. Let's just say Meta (META) has 10,000 H100s. At what point do they have to upgrade? And then what do they do with the H100? Do they sell them off for $0.50 on the $1 or do they keep them and go buy whatever the new chip is? I don't know. It's going to be very interesting to play out. I just think if you believe in artificial intelligence and LLMs, and I just think NVIDIA is still the best way to play it.\"\n\nAnd in the Wall Street Research Corner, Wells Fargo says the boom in AI sets up companies focused on natural gas as trend winners.\n\nMidstream energy companies focused on natural gas should be visible long-term beneficiaries from the build out of data-center capacity in the U.S. to run AI operations, analyst Ian Mikkelsen said. About 43% of electricity is generated from natural gas and the build-out of energy-hungry data centers is in very early stages.\n\n\u201cWe believe that U.S. natural gas production capacity and reserves are sufficient to meet growing demand, with infrastructure being the key constraint in balancing supply with this demand growth over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect this to provide midstream companies with incremental growth opportunities and higher utilization of existing assets, ultimately extending the terminal value of natural gas infrastructure.\u201d",
    "summary": "However, growth stocks with high valuations lagged the median firm by 32 pp when they failed to meet sales estimates, 2x the underperformance of lower multiple stocks.\"\nWe don't know what competitors might be coming down the pipeline with their own chips.\nI don't know if they'll actually be able to do it.\nI don't know.\nI just think if you believe in artificial intelligence and LLMs, and I just think NVIDIA is still the best way to play it.\"",

    "title": "Micron Stock: Why I Bought The 20% Pullback (Aggressively) (NASDAQ:MU)",
    "body": "JHVEPhoto\n\nThe boom in artificial intelligence (AI) has stocks like Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) exploding to new highs and nosebleed valuations. The same can be said for many semiconductor stocks, like Arm Holdings (ARM), which trades at 58 times sales (48 times on a forward basis). The demand for data centers and computing power is intense.\n\nHere are some facts about data centers:\n\nStatista forecasts that Data center global sales will grow from $344 billion this year to $440 billion in 2028.\n\nHyperscale data centers house over 5,000 servers and 10,000 sq feet; many have over 1 million sq feet. For instance, Meta's (META) Prineville, Oregon center checks in at 4.5 million sq. ft.\n\nHyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), and Meta plan to spend billions constructing new massive facilities in the next few years.\n\nData centers desperately require memory, specifically High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). Enter Micron (NASDAQ:MU) into the equation, a name synonymous with memory.\n\nWhat does Micron do?\n\nIn a nutshell, Micron provides memory solutions, specifically Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and flash memory or NAND.\n\nDRAM is the primary working memory for servers, PCs, and other devices. It stores data temporarily while the system is on.\n\nNAND retains data when a device is powered off. For instance, flash drives and Smartphones use NAND memory to retain data.\n\nMicron's products are critical to smartphones, PCs, automotive, and other industries. Under the DRAM umbrella is HBM, which is widely used in data centers where DRAM chips are stacked on top of each other to increase processing power and efficiency.\n\nYou can see by the end markets why Micron is a cyclical stock. AI is driving an upcycle now.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe cyclical nature was on full display in fiscal 2023, as sales were cut nearly in half, dropping from $30.8 billion to $15.5 billion year-over-year (YOY). Demand cratered because its customers had too much inventory, many expected a recession and cut back spending, and tensions with China hurt sales in that market.\n\nMore recently, the stock pulled back 20% from its high after a terrific earnings report, but on \"soft guidance,\" as shown below.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nI always chuckle when quality stocks report excellent results and then fall on light guidance. As if we never learn that nearly all management teams sandbag guidance. Some more than others, but they all want targets that they can beat and raise.\n\nI suspect this is no different.\n\nIs Micron a buy now?\n\nRevenue\n\nSales in Q3 FY24 popped 82% YOY and 17% sequentially, reaching $6.8 billion, as depicted below.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nData center sales grew 50% over the prior quarter.\n\nManagement Commentary\n\nEven more intriguing, the company didn't provide solid guidance for HBM next fiscal year.\n\nFrom the company's presentation:\n\nWe expect to generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in FY24 and multiple $Bs (Billions) in revenue from HBM in FY25.\n\nThrowing out that \"multiple billions\" line so casually tells me that they expect extreme demand. Management also stated that HBM is already sold out through the end of 2025.\n\nSmartphones and PCs\n\nAI will also drive the need for upgraded smartphones and PCs since the applications require more processing power. Unfortunately, slowing consumer spending could hamper this segment. Mobile was the only segment where revenue fell sequentially, albeit by just 1%.\n\nSource: Micron\n\nStill, the medium-term prospects are positive.\n\nMargins\n\nA hallmark of an upcycle is pricing power. Micron's margins are steadily increasing, as shown below.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nRising margins are excellent leading indicators.\n\nValuation\n\nMicron's current valuation looks ridiculous. Seeking Alpha's quant ranking gives it an \"F\". However, the current valuation is highly misleading.\n\nThe company lost money last year, and analysts expect just $1.22 earnings-per-share (EPS) in 2024; however, they predict an average of $9.51 EPS next year (with a low estimate of $6 and a high estimate of $15).\n\nAs shown below, this makes the forward valuation for 2025 quite attractive at a P/E under 14.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nDuring the last upcycle, the P/E passed 30 before plunging when it was clear the cycle was reversing. Therein lies the risk. If this cycle is interrupted, then the stock is likely dead money. However, if analysts are correct, then this is a $190 stock next year based on a reasonable P/E of 20. For me, the reward is greater than the risk, so I bought the recent pullback.",

    "title": "S&P 500: Prepping For The H2 Correction, Week Starting July 8th (Technical Analysis)",
    "body": "primeimages\n\nIt's been a great start to Q3 as the S&P 500 (SPY) broke strongly to new all-time highs. This was expected due to the positive momentum from Q2 and a higher timeframe bullish bias, and my article from two weeks ago suggested to \"hold your nose and buy.\"\n\nThis week's article looks at expectations for H2 and why it may not be such a good idea to buy now as we are above 5550. Various techniques will be applied to multiple timeframes in a top-down process which also considers the major market drivers. The aim is to provide an actionable guide with directional bias, important levels, and expectations for future price action.\n\nS&P 500 Monthly and Quarterly\n\nThe S&P500 has closed out its third stellar quarter in a row. Furthermore, 2024 has had the second best start to election year in history, with only 1976 having a larger return through the first half of the year.\n\nA positive start to an election year has been an extremely positive omen for SPX. Out of the 16 previous years where it has had a positive return in the first half of the year, prices have been higher 100% of the time in the second half, including 5 years that had double-digit returns for H2. The table below is from our research at Matrixtrade -\n\nH2 Returns (Matrixtrade)\n\nOf course, a lot can happen in the space of 6 months. The table below shows we can still expect an average drawdown of -7.25% in these typically bullish periods.\n\nH2 Drawdowns (Matrixtrade)\n\nTechnical analysis can help identify when this drawdown will unfold and find opportunities to buy the dip.\n\nA look at the monthly chart shows new highs for July, which is expected given the bullish June bar and positive Q2. The first half of July is also the best performing two-week period of the year. Amazingly, the Nasdaq has been higher in July 16 times in a row.\n\nSPX Monthly (Tradingview)\n\nBut just like H2, or Q3, a lot can happen in a month. A 5% rally can lead to a top, reversal and then close the month +0.5%; it would still be marked down as a positive month.\n\nNow that new highs have been made, the July bar should really stay above the 5446 monthly low to stay bullish. Later in the month, the June high of 5523 could be important, but it is too close to current trading to be relevant now.\n\nFibonacci extensions and measured moves provide targets. The next major level comes from the 1.618* expansion of the 2021-2022 bear market and is way up at 5638.\n\nSupport comes in at the July low of 5446 and the 5265 area.\n\nJuly is bar 8 (of a possible 9) in an upside Demark exhaustion count. These counts can have an effect from bar 8 onwards, so a reaction could be seen this month.\n\nS&P 500 Weekly\n\nA very strong bar formed this week, negating the bearish implications of the previous weekly \"doji\" bar. The close at the highs and above the channel suggest the move will follow through early next week.\n\nThe weekly Demark exhaustion signal has now completed, and this is a red flag, especially combined with the monthly exhaustion now in play. Looking back at previous 3 signals, we can see a reaction either on bar 9, or 2 weeks following the completion of bar 9. That is a pretty big window, and certainly no reason to short, but the warning is clear: the last two corrections of >5% happened soon after weekly exhaustion signals.\n\nSPX Weekly (Tradingview)\n\nResistance at the weekly channel highs has been broken, but as mentioned in previous articles, this was minor and the rally \"could simply hug the channel as it moves higher.\"\n\nThis week's low of 5446 is initial support. 5265 is a major level, but should not be tested if this rally is to stay strong.\n\nS&P 500 Daily\n\n3 bullish daily bars propelled the SPX to 5570 and Friday's close at 5567 was right at the highs, suggesting follow through at some point. The French election at the weekend may cause European stocks to dip and pull down S&P500 futures into a lower open, but as long as the gap down is not significant (e.g. over -1%), it should recover directly for new highs. Indeed, a favorable result in France may cause a large gap higher.\n\nThe volume profile at the right of the daily chart shows a balanced profile centered on the heavy volume level of 5470. Moving too far over 5570 would pull this out of balance and is likely unsustainable without building a new high volume area at higher prices. 5470 could act as a magnet on the next dip.\n\nSPX Daily (Tradingview)\n\nResistance comes from the weekly and monthly references.\n\nOn the downside, 5440-46 is initial support, but the big level remains 5400. The 20dma is at 5452 and rising, so could be in play on the next dip.\n\nAn upside Demark will be on bar 8 on Monday. A reaction is expected on bars 8 or 9 so new highs could lead to exhaustion and a pause/dip.\n\nDrivers/Events\n\nThe odds for a September cut have been rising and now sit at around 72%. Fed Chair Powell helped this process by stating we \u201care getting back on a disinflationary path\u201d at the ECB\u2019s Sintra forum on Tuesday. Weak data such as ISM Services PMI falling from 53.8 to 48.8 and an ADP payrolls miss aided the dovish expectations, but it was Friday's Jobs Report which pushed the odds over 70%.\n\nYou've got to wonder how bullish this really is. A September cut has always been likely as long as inflation moderates, and we don't really need to see the economic data unravelling as well. After all, history tells us cuts won't be the magic solution for a slowing economy.\n\nNext week has three major scheduled events. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Fed Chair Powell will make his Semi-Annual Monetary Policy Report before the Senate Banking Committee. Is there anything new to say? Perhaps there is in light of last week's data, although it would be a major shock if he hints at a July cut in 25 days. The odds of this are very low at only 7.8%, so the Fed would have to be very concerned to surprise the markets this way. I therefore wonder if a July cut would be a \"sell the news\" event, as it would reflect a Fed panicked by the economy.\n\nThursday's CPI reading is expected to come in at 0.1%, taking the YoY figure to 3.1%. This would be another step towards easing.\n\nFriday's release of PPI may only ignite short-term moves, but is still an important metric.\n\nProbable Moves Next Week(s)\n\nThe stats and the charts are all bullish. H2 is very likely to close higher, as is July. However, this is quite a vague expectation and there is scope for all sorts of moves before the monthly and H2 closes.\n\nWhile dips at certain levels may be a buying opportunity, I would no longer to suggest to \"hold your nose and buy\" near the current price of 5567 - it's too distant from support and inflection points. Furthermore, exhaustion signals are mounting up in multiple timeframes and the rally is being driven by weak data encouraging dovish positioning. There is a short-term bias for further highs next week based on Friday's strong close, but I actually expect new highs to reverse on Monday or Tuesday and snap back to at least the high volume area of 5470.\n\nAs always, inflection points can be used to assess whether the next dip is healthy or a change in trend. Unfortunately, these cannot be moved higher, so 5440-46 remains initial support and 5400 stays as a key inflection. Holding these levels should lead to yet another new high, but a weekly close below 5400 could open the door for a move to 5000 later in Q3. This would ultimately create a buying opportunity to seek a positive close for H2.",

    "body": "LindaJoHeilman\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn my last analysis we talked a little about companies that are adopting a defensive strategy to navigate a slow traffic scenario. Endogenous and exogenous pressures require the definition of a strategy, and it seems that among QSRs, adapting to the time preferences of low-income guests is the most natural strategy. After all, there is direct competition with convenience stores.\n\nIn this context, I invite you to take a deep dive into the strategies and recent developments of Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK), one of the big names in QSR with the peculiarity of having a large part of its units located in California, the epicenter of AB 1228.\n\nBefore we begin our analysis I would like to talk a little more about the current situation before getting into the actual developments. First, no one is immune to the downturn and like almost the entire industry in the first quarter, Jack reported a sharp decrease in same-store-sales, both in its own stores (0.6%) and in franchises (2.6%). Del Taco, which is another concept owned by Jack, reported a decrease in SSS of 1.4% system-wide. Basically, with the drop in traffic, restaurants that had a positive SSS in the quarter needed to compensate for this factor with an increase in the average check. In Jack's case, the company even managed to increase the average check by 3.1%, but this was not enough to compensate for the 3.7% drop in traffic.\n\nAlthough we do not see major changes in operating costs for the Jack in the Box concept, with labor costs representing 30.6% of all quarterly revenue within the restaurants operated by the company, the company is going through a period of refranchising aiming to contain operational costs. In the Del Taco concept, for example, labor costs grew by 1.4%, reaching 34.9% of all revenue generated. Remember the '30/30/30 Rule'. This is generally the minimum acceptable standard when dealing with operating costs in restaurants.\n\nProbably aware of this, the company made some changes to the units' management models. In 2023, the company refranchised 5 Jack in the Box units and 16 Del Taco units. This year, even before the end of the first semester, the company refranchised 13 Del Taco units. This movement will probably have consequences in relation to the volume of revenue generated by the company, but it is an important movement that aims to contain costs in order to sustain growth without using an absurd amount of capital.\n\nUntil last year, Del Taco was made up of 46% owned units and 54% franchised. At the moment, the concept has approximately 28% of its own units and 72% of franchised units. This movement should continue until the composition becomes similar to that of Jack in the Box, which in 2024 has 7% of its own units and 93% of franchises.\n\nNow that I've introduced the company's current situation, let's navigate topic by topic and understand how Jack is positioning itself within the industry\n\nSome generalities about the QSR situation in California and rising labor costs: How does this impact traffic and margins?\n\nWith a large portion of its units located in California, I consider it important that we dedicate a section to understanding how the impacts of AB 1228 are affecting QSRs within the current dynamics of the restaurant industry. First take a look at the numbers.\n\nThe state of California is Jack's main market, accommodating 949 units. This represents about 43% of all its units, ahead of Texas (with 584 units and representing 27% of total units) and Arizona (with 178 units and representing 8% of total units). When we look at the population/restaurant ratio we have very attractive numbers even with the large concentration of units in two states. There are 41,945 people per restaurant in California, 49,651 in Texas and 40,893 in Arizona. In Los Angeles alone, Jack has 42 units, six more than in San Diego.\n\nGiven this high concentration of units, it is clear that setting the minimum wage at $20 per hour only in QSRs would have significant impacts for Jack. But before we look inside, I invite you to look outside. How does the minimum wage policy affect the segment? At the end of the day, as the famous French author Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat says, we must not end our investigation on what is seen, but we must seek to know what is not seen.\n\nYes, the first basic observation (what you see) would be the decrease in traffic and the increase in labor costs. These labor costs need to be passed on if the company wants to keep its margins intact. But if guests are becoming increasingly price sensitive and there is a whole host of substitute products threatening the financial integrity of restaurant operations, that cost will be passed along with the bitter price of decreased traffic. Let's talk about decreasing traffic first.\n\nAccording to a very interesting survey by Placer.ai, fast-food chains within the state of California had weaker traffic than the national average in 10 of the 12 weeks after the law was enacted. This is clearly a sum of three interconnected factors.\n\nThe first factor is due to substitute products. Convenience stores, bakeries and markets are taking a share of the restaurant market precisely because they present cheaper and sometimes just as appetizing options. According to Porter, substitute products have a very interesting task in the dynamics of industries and competitive strategy: they reduce the potential returns of an industry. And so we saw this happening in practice precisely with the low-income guest, but all the guests seem to be giving in little by little. Research by Technomic presents us with some impressive results regarding this fact.\n\nThe number of people who visit restaurants at least once a week fell from 68% to 67%. When we looked at low-income guests we also saw a drop from 59% to 58%. On the other hand, when we look at convenience stores the scenario is very different. The percentage of customers who go to convenience stores increased from 57% to 59%, and when we look at low-income consumers, this number increased from 55% to 58%.\n\nThe second factor is also clear as a sunny day. Labor costs needed to be passed on for the sake of earnings integrity. I'm not saying that the price increase started only when we saw an increase in labor costs, but well before that. As I said in my RBI analysis, many fast-food chains have raised prices at two and even three times inflation in the last ten years. This was the case with McDonald's (MCD) with a 100% increase in prices since 2014 and Popeyes increasing by 86%. Other chains like Wendy's (WEN) and Burger King (QSR) were a little more restrained and rose 55%. An important observation is that inflation in the same period was 31%.\n\nThe third factor, and this is interesting because it represents a dynamic within California that differs from the rest of the country, is that the decline in QSR traffic is being pressured by the underlying increase in traffic at full-service restaurants. Also from the perspective of Placer.ai's research, we can note that traffic was positive in eight of the last twelve weeks, surpassing quick service restaurants in all periods analyzed. This indicates that there is a transfer of occasional guests who prioritize value and experience within the benefits they expect at the time of the meal (something that is much more present and malleable within full-service restaurants by their very nature). Everything in the end comes down to the value perceived by the guest.\n\nThis is interesting because the national average of traffic at full-service restaurants has been quite different in the rest of the country in the last two months than within California, as shown in the following graph:\n\nPlacer.ai\n\nIn finance we generally measure the cost-benefit of certain projects by relating the present value of cash flows to the initial cost, whereas in marketing everything is more subjective. The cost-benefit index for consumers has to do with the relationship between expected benefits and perceived value. If guests have the opportunity to enjoy a full-service meal with all the underlying benefits that such a restaurant offers for a price just a little higher than a QSR, the answer becomes obvious and explains this phenomenon caused by the increase in the minimum wage within California and the situation we see today. Putting this discussion once again under 'Porterian' terms we have a substantial competitive advantage in favor of full-service restaurants within the state.\n\nIf you've read my previous reviews, you know that this dynamic between limited-service restaurants and full-service restaurants only occurs within California. We have plenty of examples to confirm this. Companies like BJ's (BJRI), Chuy's (CHUY), First Watch (FWRG), Olive Garden and the entire portfolio of Darden (DRI) concepts except Longhorn, Dine Brands (DIN) and many other service restaurant chains complete showed a decline in traffic.\n\nSpeaking specifically about Jack now, we know that the company is committed to offering an attractive value offer, recognizing the need to adjust price-based promotions to navigate this scenario. At the end of the day, QSRs are closer to competing with convenience stores than the broader value proposition offered by full-service restaurants, so when it comes to limited-service restaurants there is almost an overwhelming need to bring back the low-income guests, and that's what Jack seems to admit. We will talk about promotions later.\n\nWithin this context we saw the company's SSS drop 2.5% system-wide, mainly driven by the decrease in traffic. This number worsens when we consider franchises, which had a SSS reduction of approximately 2.6%. Meanwhile, company-owned restaurants had a 0.6% lower SSS.\n\nNow talking about labor costs and how this impacted margins this last quarter, we have the following overview:\n\nTotal revenue (Own restaurants and franchises) and operating costs (Author)\n\nUnlike most restaurants, in the last quarter Jack was able to proportionally reduce labor expenses as its revenue from its own restaurants decreased. That is, through the franchise model the company is reducing labor costs. Proportionally in the quarter, Jack reduced labor costs by 1.64%, and the same panorama was seen in the other operational cost centers. Now, when we relate revenue from own operations to labor expenses, we obtain a proportion of 32% in the second quarter of 2023 which increased by less than 0.5%. In a simpler way, we can say that Jack is 'leveraging' its franchise model to absorb the rise in labor costs, reducing the pressure on its financial resources.\n\nTo summarize this dynamic, we can infer that despite the increased pressure on labor costs, Jack is optimizing the management of this cost center and increasing the performance of its franchise model, even when this reduces revenue from its own operations, managing to transfer part of these costs and preserving the integrity of its operations. Regarding slow traffic, with the imminent price increase to contain costs, it is expected that this trend will continue to repeat itself as long as macroeconomic pressures remain tight and low-income guests are kept away by substitute products and full service restaurants (the latter specifically within California).\n\nIn this scenario, it is important that we take a look at the mix of promotions and other developments that serve as an attraction for low-income guests, and that is what we will discuss in the following section.\n\nHow does Jack fit into an environment focused on financial efficiency and price-based promotions?\n\nTo start, let's take a look at Jack's mix of promotions. We know that management is committed to the return of traffic and low-income guests, which is essential for the operation of the QSR and the maintenance of traffic. After all, this is a volume-oriented segment, with few opportunities to add value through its dynamic, streamlined nature and a price-sensitive guest.\n\nAt the end of May, Jack launched its 'Munchies Under $4' promotion. This promotion consists of a menu of selected items with great appeal for less than $4. The promotion includes Jr. Jumbo Jack, Tiny Tacos, French Toast Sticks, and the new Sourdough Grilled Cheese, among other options. The new promotion is clearly targeted at low-income guests, in the same vein as other fast-food chains we've seen recently. This is a strategy that aims to influence the balance of forces within the QSR segment, presenting a strategy that aims to combat the actual causes of traffic reduction.\n\nIf you are paying attention to the industry, you will remember that almost all of Jack's direct competitors also established segmented promotions for the most price-sensitive guest. Burger King launched and promised to maintain the \"Eat Like a King\" promotion until the end of the year, which consists of choosing a sandwich option from three available (Chicken Jr., Whopper Jr. or Bacon Cheeseburger), fries, nuggets and drinks, all for $5. Popeyes, which is also an RBI brand, has reintroduced its \"Big Box\" with two pieces of fried chicken, a choice of side and a lentil biscuit for $6.99. Wendy's with breakfast for $3 and the \"Biggie Bag\", offering a similar offer to Burger King, but with upscaling options ranging from $4 to $6. McDonald's also launched a McChicken or McDouble promotion with nuggets, fries and a drink for $5 in June, lasting an estimated month, despite some claims from franchisees that were circumvented through a deal with Coca Cola (KO). . There are many examples, we could spend a good amount of time talking about them. But the most important fact is that Jack is acting reactively to market movements, and this demonstrates that the company is committed to bringing low-income guests back to restaurants.\n\nThe efficiency of using the park is also being considered by the company. Wendy's, for example, has been relying on its off-premises sales in the mornings, which have proven to be an interesting weapon for generating alternative sources of revenue in historically slower periods. We also have some developments of this type at Jack. First in the morning, the company made Toast Sticks a permanent item on the menu and believes that this inclusion will gradually strengthen the park in the morning on a consistent basis. During the evening, management also believes they have a chance to gain market share, mainly by reintroducing Chick-n-Tater Melt and marketing efforts.\n\nThe most interesting thing here is that Jack is not living off promotions alone. We talked a little about 'barbell menu strategy' and how this is especially important in the current scenario. In early 2024, the company launched the Smashed Jack Burger, made with seasoned beef, topped with grilled onions, thick pickles and a new sauce called Boss Sauce, served on a buttery brioche bun. The pricing is more attractive to 'premium' guests and serves as an interesting lever to increase the average check. It turns out that after a very strong launch, the supplier halted production, forcing Jack to halt sales until the supply chain stabilized in March. After its return, the Smashed Jack Burger helped catapult the average check by 2%, which is curious to say the least. I believe that Jck got the pricing right for Smashed, as it is at a threshold where low-income guests can still try it while still guaranteeing a significant cash inflow when compared to promotions. And often the cash inflow is as significant as substantial margins.\n\nNew POS, new possibilities\n\nIn the digital field I see Jack still a little behind its direct competitors. Around 13% of all its sales are in the digital environment. RBI, for example, increased its sales in digital channels from $13 billion in 2022 to $14 billion in 2023, an increase of almost 8% across all its brands. Burger King US alone showed 40% growth in the digital channel, which represents around 27% of all total sales. At Popeyes, approximately 25% of all sales are made through digital channels. At YUM! Brands (YUM), we saw a 25% increase in digital sales over the same period, with Taco Bell achieving an impressive 31% increase in digital sales. Wendy's, slightly above Jack in this sense, reached the mark of 14.5% of its total sales through digital channels. As you can see, there is no shortage of examples.\n\nIn the digital field, another very interesting development is the integration of the new POS, called Qu. If you read my review of Dine Brands and how the integration of data collected by Tray POS is being used to generate IHOP in-app purchasing suggestions and how this is helping to increase the average check per guest, I highly recommend strongly reading. These are ways in which restaurants can adopt data management and artificial intelligence to generate extra sales, and this is the future for the industry, there is no way around it. But what are the benefits of this new POS for Jack, and how will the reach of digital sales enhance the guest experience?\n\nFirst of all, the new POS will aid in operational efficiency in routine tasks such as integration of payment methods, order management, kitchen management, staff management for peak hours, effective implementation of self-service kiosks, menu management and of stocks. Note that in the long term, after the complete integration of the restaurants with the new POS, more accurate management of these processes will help Jack to expand its margins and achieve stronger results. It is interesting how almost all players are developing process management solutions that involve integrating the POS with some AI system that assists daily processes.\n\nWe can give some examples of this. BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) is a chain of casual dining restaurants that is standing out by improving its profit margin by adopting processes that benefit its operational efficiency, especially after PW Partners adapted the company's cost structure. Integrating your POS with the AI \u200b\u200btool allows you to identify the busiest days in advance, so managers at the unit level can make decisions that increase the efficiency of operations.\n\nAnother interesting example is the case of Starbucks (SBUX). With queue management problems in recent times, mainly due to the complexity of preparing customizable drinks and logistics with ice, the company developed the 'Siren Craft System'. This system is basically an update of the same one the company used in 2022 and consists of three distinct fronts. The first relates to the adoption of new preparation routines. The second is the creation of the 'Peak Play Caller' employee figure, who can change roles according to traffic needs. And the third is the integration of AI-based predictive tools with the POS to detect critical moments for the formation of very long queues and increased waiting times.\n\nWhen we talk about POS integrations with AI for suggestions for online sales platforms like IHOP, we still don't have a concrete forecast, but the most important fact for Jack is that this is now achievable.\n\nRemodeling and lean units: a point of convergence\n\nAs I have always said in my analyses, the development of lean units is more than desirable, it is necessary. With a very mature industry and profitability being sucked up by substitute products and high entry barriers related to economies of scale, industry managers are increasingly valuing expansion projects through units with a higher cost-benefit ratio and a lower payback. In fact, in my last text in which I wrote about First Watch, one of my points of criticism was precisely the underutilization of assets and the lack of projects aimed at lean units, despite developing some very interesting renovations in the kitchen.\n\nAnd don't think that even within the theme of lean units there is no differentiation, quite the opposite. Bloomin' (BLMN), for example, underwent a broad project in 2023 to remodel and close Outback units that were not performing satisfactorily, which became known as the \"2023 Closing Project\", where 10 of its own units were closed in the United States, all of which were units of old models. On the other hand, in 2021 Bloomin' developed a type of unit called \"Joey\", which is 4,800 to 5,000 square feet. Approximately 16 Joey units were opened in Brazil in 2023.\n\nDine Brands, in contrast to smaller units with greater reach to lower volume markets, developed the dual-branded unit, which interconnects an IHOP unit with an Applebee's unit contiguously, without internal partitions. Note that this model optimizes the park at different times for the two concepts, as each one has its own peculiarities regarding peak traffic hours, however its implementation is not lean, quite the contrary, opening costs are even bigger.\n\nOnce again, there are many examples. For Jack we have the 'CRAVED' model. The plan is for the company to achieve a net growth of 2% per year in relation to the number of units, with all new openings using the same prototype, which is already being used in Mexico, where Jack opened its first unit in the second quarter and is already attracting the attention of operators, according to the CEO. The 'CRAVED' model has an estimated payback of less than five years and is already being implemented in 88 restaurants that are at some point in their development phase.\n\nTo have some basis for comparison in relation to the estimated payback of the 'CRAVED' model, which is 5 years or less, let's take a look at some projects that I have been following. Portillo's (PTLO), a fast-casual chain recently released some data about its \"Units of the Future\", developed to spearhead its accelerated expansion project. The company currently has paybacks of 8 years for units in the Midwest, 7 years for units in the Sunbelt and 4 years for a unit in Chicagoland. After the introduction of lean units (scheduled for 2025), paybacks would decrease to 6, 5 and 3 years respectively.\n\nA five-year payback is what most restaurants want when developing lean units. This generally means a decrease of two to three years in the payback of an average volume project. Along the same lines and with an average payback of five years, there are also the new units of Potbelly (PBPB) and Walk-On's Sports Bistreaux. Therefore, I see the 'CRAVED' units as a good sign that the company is acting proactively within the new industry requirements. This is a sign that there is the possibility of expansion in the medium term, perhaps internationally.\n\nSome considerations about financing and investments\n\nBefore formulating my thesis for Jack, I would like to establish some comparisons about the company's profitability. To do this, I would like to examine some metrics that will help us discover how Jack behaves in relation to some direct competitors. Let's do this quickly so we don't go on too long:\n\nAuthor\n\nAt first glance we can notice a decrease in the rate of return using operating cash flow. That is, in simplified terms, the company is generating a lower cash return in the last twelve months than before. But how did this happen if net profit did not show anomalous variations during this period. Simple, the OCF for the last twelve months was directly impacted by an accumulation of operating accounts, more precisely due to receivables. For the first time in two years, Jack presented a negative operating cash flow, and this occurred at the end of last year, accumulating $107.5 million in operating assets that needed to be covered through investment in current assets and consequently reduced the OCF. In the last quarter, Jack still had its OCF reduced by just over $3 million for the same reason.\n\nHowever, despite keeping the OCF reduced due to this clutter in the operating accounts, Jack still managed to maintain a record investment of $98.8 million in Capex and maintain a positive free cash flow. Note that despite these problems, Jack managed to maintain its free cash flow on invested capital at levels similar to Wendy's. If we normalized its free cash flow to non-anomalous levels we would have a free cash flow of approximately 6%, which is not bad at all.\n\nAlso note the difference between ROA and ROCE. This is precisely due to the comparison method and the exclusion of interest paid on third-party capital and taxes on the latter. In conjunction with the high burden of implicit costs on third-party capital, Jack also has many sources of operational financing in current liabilities, which reduces the need for financial liabilities to fund immobilization and also reduces the capital employed. To give you an idea, when we exclude the effects of interest and taxes, Jack shows an EBIT margin of 15.14%, which is more than 90% higher than the industry median.\n\nThis brings us to the need to take a look at Jack's financing structure:\n\nAuthor\n\nNote that even by industry standards, Jack finds itself with very high levels of debt. Despite the reduction in leverage since 2019 (where the company reached a debt ratio of 176%), the company only reduced just under 5% of its long-term debt over the course of two years, which still continues to put pressure on its operating profit . Remember, despite this, the company does not incur short-term debt to maintain its investments in operational assets, but uses operational liabilities, mainly those not related to the cash conversion cycle, but which help the company to not have to incur \"addictive\" short-term loans. In any case, depending on short-term loans or not, I consider Jack's debt levels to be quite high. Despite not incurring a massive economic risk due to the satisfactory generation of EBIT, the company incurs massive financial risk due to leverage.\n\nStill on debt, I would also like to make some brief considerations about the imminence of financial risk and the possibility of economic risk based on coverage data. Firstly, I was able to identify a deterioration in the Debt Efficiency index (Return on Debt/Cost of Debt). The index in 2017 was 5.6, falling to 2.7 during the pandemic and maintaining a range between 2.8 and 4.0 until then. Both the return on debt and the Debt Efficiency are at levels below their 10-year average.\n\nOther indicators that I modeled were related to debt coverage from Cash Flow. As you already know, Jack's Cash Flow has been suffering for some time due to an increase in operational accounts, mainly at the end of 2023 and beginning of 2024. We have already talked about this. But what we haven't talked about yet is how this affects debt coverage. With Cash Flow stagnant and debt rising (at least until 2019) we noticed a deterioration in principal coverage using OCF. Over the last ten years, Jack maintained an average principal coverage ratio with an OCF of 7.71. This meant that Jack generally needed a little more than 7x its OCF for the corresponding year to cover its debt principal. Jack currently maintains an index of 14.9. For those interested in more heterodox data, debt interest coverage from the OCF through the debt service coverage indicator adjusted for cash flow variability also deteriorated, falling from 2.79 in 2019 to 1.94.\n\nTo have a basis for comparison, the average coverage of indebted companies like Bloomin' Brands is 8.09. In the case of Debt Efficiency, despite seeing a drop in pre-pandemic standards, Jack still outperforms direct competitors such as Wendy's, which has maintained an index of 2.17 in the last five years, while Jack has an index of 3.14 in the same period. Therefore, we can say that even though it is very indebted and needs to restructure its financing sources, Jack is still able to maintain solvency rates in line with companies (despite being very indebted) that are less indebted than itself.\n\nMy thesis\n\nIn my opinion, Jack has everything a limited-service restaurant needs to navigate an environment that suffers exogenous pressures (due to substitute products and increases in labor costs) and endogenous pressures (promotional environments and industry-level margin compression). This implies that the company is actively positioning itself so that its capabilities integrate new industry paradigms.\n\nPromotions with appeal, use of barbell pricing in menu engineering, premium items with a satisfactory gross cash inflow, successful launches (see the case of Smashed Jack Burger and all the buzz on social media) make me see that both prices and The products are aligned with industry paradigms.\n\nBroader strategies such as the integration of a modern POS that allows the use of all the benefits provided by AI are also almost mandatory today. Although in this sense Jack is not at the same level as its peers, the recent integration with Qu seems to me that there will be developments in this regard. Therefore, the coming quarters should see an increase in digital sales as the company completes this integration.\n\nOther needs that I also see as mandatory are the optimization of the park at times with lower traffic and the development of lean units being developed within Jack. The 'CRAVED' unit appears to have a very satisfactory payback and will be able to lead the international expansion project. In this sense, I see the success of the units in Mexico and the interest of new operators as something very interesting and should also be observed closely. Another very interesting point is the refranchising of company-owned units. This is helping and will likely continue to help Jack deal with rising labor costs in the long term.\n\nFurthermore, the aspects that concern me at the moment refer to the structural aspects of the company. We saw a dilapidation in solvency ratios, corroborated by a weaker operating cash flow and a persistently large long-term debt that appears to be out of step with the EBIT, which continues to grow slowly, typical of mature companies. However, Jack maintains a negative net need for working capital, managing to finance its working capital from operational liabilities. This implies that even with the increase in operating assets that we have recently seen cluttering up the cash flow, Jack does not appear to have a need to increase financing and increase its total debts.\n\nIn my opinion, these structural factors are resolved when we compare them with other indebted companies (as I have done previously) and look at their undervaluation. Therefore, even with these headwinds, I still see potential in Jack within the current environment, as the company is adapting to the vast majority of needs that a modern QSR must seek.\n\nAt current price levels I would recommend 'Buy' for Jack. I believe that all the problems we discussed previously have already been priced in. The company is taking extensive measures both to maintain margins and to attract lost traffic by presenting a very interesting promotional mix.\n\nValuation\n\nI would like to start our valuation procedure today not with the 'Comps', but with the NPVGO Model. To accomplish this, we need to calculate both the value of your current operations and the value of future growth opportunities. We consider EPS for fiscal 2024 to be in line with analyst estimates of $6.32. For the discount rate I used 7.97%. The payout rate for Jack is approximately 29%, naturally the retention rate will be 71%.\n\nThus, the retention per share is $4.49, which will generate growth from retention of just $0.28 in the first year of retention, $0.29 in the second and $0.31 in the third. As the retention-based investment serves as the initial cost of investment projects each year, we have a negative NPV all these years, which when we bring it to present value with the help of the discount rate we have the following values \u200b\u200bfor the next three years : -$0.89, -$0.86 and -$0.83.\n\nBut you may even wonder: why do managers choose projects with negative NPVs? Wouldn't it be easier to distribute a higher percentage of the profit. The issue is not that simple. Stephen Ross, a leading professor of corporate finance conjectures that managers like to control large companies and retain profits rather than pay dividends and thus increase the size of the firm. Anyway, when we calculate the perpetual value of NPVGO it is -$27.31. We need to add this to the value of the firm as if it were a 'cash cow', using the EPS to calculate the simple perpetual value, which is $79.30. This means the enterprise value + NPVGO is $51.99. This is approximately 5.3% above the current share price.\n\nLet's see how this happens in the 'Comps Model'? I selected five companies to compare with Jack. The result is in the following table:\n\nAuthor\n\nNote that to arrive at the value of $89.28 I excluded from the average both Price/Sales and EV/Sales which were inflating our target price using the Comps model. Remembering that I used both Equity ratios and Enterprise ratios, the latter being multiples that consider the capital structure. Note that even considering the capital structure, both EV/EBIT and EV/EBITDA present prices higher than the current value of the share.\n\nNow we can look at the discounted cash flow models. First let's start with dividends. We already know that because the payout is low (less than 30%), the expected dividend (D1) will be lower and, consequently, our target price will be lower. To resolve this fact, I will use the Single Period DDM and the Multi Period DDM, this way we will avoid considerations regarding the growth of these dividends. The result is what you see in the table below:\n\nAuthor\n\nNow let's model the DCF. For WACC we will consider 6.73%. The following image is the FCFF forecast for the coming years:\n\nAuthor\n\nNote that the DCF model also indicates that the share is being traded below its intrinsic value, more or less in line with the value we found in NPVGO. However, in this case, the price based on the DCF points to an upside of approximately 6.5%.\n\nWe can still use the Graham Model and the Lynch Model to obtain some other perspectives that corroborate the undervaluation hypothesis. For growth in the Graham Model I used the internal growth rate (which we use in the NPVGO Model). For the Lynch Model, I used the estimated EPS growth rate for the next fiscal year. Remembering that as the Lynch Model does not indicate a target price, but rather a state of relative valuation, it will not be included in our 'football field' graph and consequently in the analyst's definitive target price.\n\nAuthor\n\nNow that we have a series of results from different valuation models, let's combine this data to find a target price that takes into account all the assumptions we made:\n\n'Football field' target price (Author)\n\nConclusion\n\nI would like to conclude by saying that although I believe in Jack's resilience in the current environment, some factors would make me consider lowering my rating for the company. The first of these is performance. Basically, aggressive adaptation strategies require more timely results to be justified. This is even more true when taking into account that QSRs compete directly with convenience stores, which puts them in a more dangerous place in terms of pricing than casual dining, for example.\n\nAnother factor that I consider extremely important is the level of debt. I will be monitoring the solvency ratios and as soon as they exceed the standards of highly indebted companies like Wendy's or Bloomin', I will give my opinion on the matter. For now I don't see any great danger, just precaution.",
    "summary": "In 2023, the company refranchised 5 Jack in the Box units and 16 Del Taco units.\nYes, the first basic observation (what you see) would be the decrease in traffic and the increase in labor costs.\nI'm not saying that the price increase started only when we saw an increase in labor costs, but well before that.\nProportionally in the quarter, Jack reduced labor costs by 1.64%, and the same panorama was seen in the other operational cost centers.\nTo accomplish this, we need to calculate both the value of your current operations and the value of future growth opportunities.",

Which brings us to today\u2019s SA Asks investment question: What\u2019s a good alternative stock to Nvidia?\n\nWe asked SA analysts Jonathan Weber, Michael Del Monte, Uttam Dey and Jere Wang of JR Research for their picks.\n\nJonathan Weber: I believe Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is a great alternative. It\u2019s got an excellent market position and moat, strong growth, and benefits from Nvidia\u2018s momentum due to being Nvidia\u2018s manufacturer. It\u2019s also significantly cheaper than Nvidia.\n\nMichael Del Monte: You can play the trade a number of ways. I prefer going down one level to Oracle (ORCL), Dell (DELL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as buyers of the GPUs for server builds, and in turn, for building out AI factories. Premiums remain relatively low, offering some upside potential from a valuation perspective.\n\nUttam Dey: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has its sleeves rolled up in two key markets that it is selling into: datacenter GPUs and PCs. On the data center front, it is expected to take back low single-digit market share, supported by an impressive product roadmap that now transitions to an annual launch cycle to match NVDA. The PC market and devices are set to see some marginal growth as well. With revenue expected to grow in the high teens and earnings expected to outpace that, AMD could easily see double-digit growth in its stock.\n\nJere Wang of JR Research: Nvidia benefits from the AI data center infrastructure buildout. It's the market leader by a mile. However, AMD's AI business is expected to exceed $4B this year, from nearly nothing last year. I believe AMD could be considered an alternative to ride the AI gold mine.\n\nMore on Nvidia",

    "body": "A trader works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, New York, U.S., March 3, 2020. Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nThe S&P 500 will plunge 32% in 2025 as a recession finally hits the US economy, BCA Research predicts.\n\nThe firm said the Fed will fail to prevent a recession as it takes its time cutting interest rates.\n\nRising unemployment and constrained credit will curb consumer spending, worsening the downturn.\n\nThe stock market will crash 32% in 2025 as the Federal Reserve fails to prevent a recession, according to the most bearish strategist on Wall Street.\n\nPeter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, said in a recent note that a recession will hit the US economy later this year or in early 2025, and the downturn will send the S&P 500 tumbling to 3,750.\n\n\"The consensus soft-landing narrative is wrong. The US will fall into a recession in late 2024 or early 2025. Growth in the rest of the world will also slow sharply,\" Berezin said.\n\nPart of Berezin's bearish outlook is based on the idea that the Fed will \"drag its feet\" in cutting interest rates, and the central bank will only meaningfully loosen financial conditions until a recession is apparent.\n\nBy then, it will be too late.\n\nBerezin highlighted that the labor market is weakening as job openings decline materially from their post-pandemic peak. An ongoing decline in the quits rate, hiring rate, and recent downward revisions to the April and May jobs report also point to a slowing labor market.\n\n\"Two years ago, workers who lost their jobs could simply walk across the street to find new work. That has become increasingly difficult,\" Berezin said.\n\nThe June jobs report showed the unemployment rate ticking higher to 4.1% from 4.0%, yet another sign of some mild weakness in the jobs market.\n\nRising unemployment could ultimately lead to consumers reducing their spending to build up their \"precautionary savings,\" Berezin said, and that will happen as consumers' ability to borrow money narrows due to rising delinquency rates.\n\nUltimately, a negative feedback loop will develop in the broader economy, which will send the stock market reeling.\n\n\"With little accumulated savings to draw on and credit availability becoming more constrained, many households will have little choice but to curb spending. Decreased spending will lead to less hiring. Rising unemployment will curb income growth, leading to less spending and even higher unemployment,\" Berezin explained.\n\nAnd perhaps most importantly, the Fed's plan to blunt any economic decline via interest rate cuts simply won't work.\n\n\"It is important to recognize that what matters for the economy is not the fed funds rate per se, but the interest rate that households and businesses actually pay,\" Berezin said.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, the average mortgage rate paid by consumers is around 4%, compared to current mortgage rates of around 7%.\n\nThat means even if the Fed cuts interest rates and mortgage rates decline, the average mortgage rate paid by consumers will continue to rise.\n\nThat principal also applies to businesses and the loans they hope to refinance in the coming years.\n\n\"These dynamics will trigger more defaults, causing pain for the banking systems. The problems that affected regional banks last year have not gone away,\" Berezin said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Here's the Best-Performing Stock-Split Stock of 2024 So Far -- and It Isn't Even Close",
    "body": "According to the Chinese calendar, 2024 is the \"year of the wood dragon.\" For investors, though, this might be the \"year of the stock splits.\" Several major companies have either already conducted stock splits or plan to do so over the next few weeks and months.\n\nHistorically, stocks tend to perform well after announcing stock splits. That's been generally true this year, with one stock delivering especially big gains. Here's the best stock-split stock of 2024 so far -- and it isn't even close.\n\nThe top contenders\n\nWalmart (NYSE: WMT) kicked off the \"year of stock splits\" in January with its announcement of a 3-for-1 split. CEO Doug McMillon said the giant retailer decided to split its shares for the first time since March 1999 to make its stock more affordable for its associates. Walmart conducted the stock split after the market close on Feb. 22, 2024.\n\nIn March, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) announced that its board of directors approved a huge 50-for-1 stock split. A few months later, after winning shareholder approval a few months later, Chipotle conducted its stock split following the market close on June 25.\n\nAmphenol (NYSE: APH) didn't announce its plans to conduct a 2-for-1 stock split until May. However, the electronic components maker beat Chipotle to the punch, conducting its stock split after the market close on June 11.\n\nSeveral other companies intend to split their shares soon. Williams-Sonoma's (NYSE: WSM) 2-for-1 stock split is scheduled for July 8. Chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split on July 12. Sony's (NYSE: SONY) 5-for-1 stock split should occur after the market close on Sept. 30. Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), which makes equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors, plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split on Oct. 2.\n\nAll three stocks that have already conducted stock splits have performed well so far this year. Walmart's shares are up nearly 30%. Chipotle and Amphenol stocks have both soared close to 36%.\n\nNearly all the stocks with splits on the way have delivered strong gains as well. Broadcom is the best performer of the group, with its shares vaulting more than 50% higher year to date. Williams-Sonoma stock is up close to 40%. Lam Research isn't far behind, with a year-to-date gain of around 38%. The only lower among these stock-split stocks is Sony, whose shares have fallen close to 10% this year.\n\nThe hands-down winner\n\nHowever, another stock-split stock is the hands-down winner. In its first-quarter update on May 22, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced plans for a 10-for-1 stock split. The graphics processing unit (GPU) maker conducted this split after the market close on June 7.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's shares have skyrocketed more than 150% year to date, eclipsing all the other top stocks announcing splits this year. This huge gain comes on top of a 239% gain in 2023.\n\nAlthough Nvidia's share price rose by a double-digit percentage in the days following its stock split, it has retreated since then. The real engine behind Nvidia's spectacular performance this year is the continued strong demand for its GPUs, thanks to a massive generative artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind.\n\nWhich is the best stock-split stock to buy now?\n\nThe old saying that there are \"different strokes for different folks\" applies to which stock-split stock is the best to buy right now. Different investors will likely prefer different stocks based on their investing styles.\n\nIf you're concerned about an economic downturn, Walmart is probably the best pick. The discount retailer is one of the top recession-resistant stocks around.\n\nIncome investors don't have great options with these stock-split stocks. However, Williams-Sonoma offers a forward dividend yield of 1.6% -- the highest yield in the group. It's also neck-and-neck with Sony as the most attractively valued of these stocks.\n\nWhat about growth investors? I think Nvidia and Broadcom are good choices. Broadcom trades at a lower forward earnings multiple, but Nvidia's growth prospects remain exceptionally bright. It's arguably still the best stock-split stock for growth investors to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $771,034!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

    "body": "Apple unfairly sacked an employee at its London headquarters who took secret photos of a female colleague and shared them with other staff, a judge has ruled.\n\nThe tech giant will be forced to pay compensation to Christoph Sieberer, a process analyst, after he went to the Employment Tribunal over his dismissal for harassment.\n\nMr Sieberer took two photos of a fellow Apple employee at the company\u2019s Battersea Power Station headquarters without her knowledge and shared them with another male employee who had a \u201ccrush\u201d on her, the tribunal heard.\n\nAn investigation by the company found that the matter amounted to sexual harassment and said Mr Sieberer\u2019s conduct had breached the company\u2019s policies, leading to his dismissal last year. However, employment judge N Walker said the decision was unfair.\n\nApple, like other tech companies, has sought to crack down on harassment in the traditionally male-dominated industry.\n\nMr Sieberer had shared one photo of the employee taken in Apple\u2019s canteen in a group chat with three other colleagues. A second, taken from three floors above her in a communal area, was sent to an employee known as Thomas who stated he had a crush on the employee.\n\nIn response to the first message, Thomas replied \u201cLook at bae there... so cute\u2026working her a-- off but still looking great\u201d and added \u201cThat\u2019s my girl\u201d.\n\nThe matter was raised with a manager by a female colleague after Thomas had shown her the second photo. Both male employees were sacked.\n\nHowever, Judge Walker said that \u201cthere were no reasonable grounds\u201d for the decision that Mr Sieberer had committed \u201csexual harassment or indeed any harassment\u201d, and that there was no evidence that anyone who saw the photos had taken offence at them.\n\nThe judge criticised Apple\u2019s policies on harassment as \u201cvague\u201d and did not meet standards for clarity.\n\nThe judgement said that taking the photos was \u201carguably an invasion of privacy\u2026 but this is a world in which there are cameras in all sorts of locations\u201d. However, it added: \u201cThe conduct was something which should not have happened\u2026 and thus it is blameworthy\u201d. Mr Sieberer had conceded that his actions were wrong.\n\nThe tribunal will award damages at a later date. It said that Mr Sieberer\u2019s typical compensation should be reduced by 10pc, not 100pc as Apple had argued.\n\nApple said in 2022 it had made changes after more than a dozen women reported harassment including sexual misconduct and claimed the company did not take the reports seriously.\n\nAfter the allegations, the company said it could have handled some cases differently and that it was making changes to training and procedures.\n\nApple\u2019s business conduct policy says: \u201cApple is dedicated to maintaining a creative, diverse, inclusive, and supportive work environment, and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of employees.\u201d\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "title": "Could Nvidia Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
    "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has reached record highs over the last year as it has become the poster child for a boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Since the start of 2023, the chipmaker's stock has skyrocketed 174%, while quarterly revenue and operating income have climbed 93% and 149%. Wall Street has rallied behind Nvidia as it has achieved a majority market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs) just as demand for the chips has soared.\n\nUncertainty about how long Nvidia can keep up its bull run weighed on its stock toward the end of June and the start of July when it fell as low as $118 per share after hitting a high of $135 per share just days before. However, its share price rebounded on July 3, rising 4% as the slump proved temporary.\n\nMeanwhile, the company still has plenty to be bullish about. Nvidia has years of dominance in the chip market under its belt, suggesting its role in AI is unlikely to dissipate any time soon. The chipmaker also has new product launches in the works that will likely continue to boost sales and earnings to retain its lead in the retail chip market.\n\nHere's why Nvidia stock could help you become a millionaire over the long term.\n\nNvidia has a long history of success in the chip market\n\nNvidia initially made a name for itself by carving out a dominating role in video games. The company was one of the first to begin selling chips to the consumer market, with gamers using its GPUs to build high-powered gaming PCs. Nvidia's success in the industry has seen its desktop GPU market share rise from 65% in 2014 to 88% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nA lead in gaming chips perfectly positioned the company to gain a dominant role in data-center GPUs and, eventually, AI. In fact, according to IoT Analytics, Nvidia is responsible for more than 90% of the data-center GPU market. Many of these data centers have become crucial to the development of the AI market, powering platforms like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia has managed to retain its dominance in GPUs in different sectors across tech despite the persistence of companies like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. For instance, while Nvidia has added more than 20 points to its desktop GPU market share over the last decade, AMD's has actually fallen from 33% to 12%. Meanwhile, Intel briefly had a 4% share in Q1 2023, which has since dwindled to 0%.\n\nThe best is yet to come\n\nWe're only about a year into the recent boom in AI, suggesting developers have barely scratched the surface of what's possible with the generative technology. As the market progresses, chip demand is only likely to continue rising. Meanwhile, Nvidia is leveraging its lead to steer the industry in its favor and challenge its competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia transitioned to a yearly release schedule for new chips when a two-year cycle was previously the market standard. The shift forced AMD and Intel to follow suit. As a result, Nvidia is gearing up to launch its Blackwell line chips, the company's next generation of AI training processors. CEO Jensen Huang noted at the announcement, \"The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history.\"\n\nA leading reason for Nvidia's success is the software platform accompanying its AI chips, which it calls its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). Developers worldwide have grown accustomed to this ecosystem, with switching akin to how a user of Apple's iPhone might feel about switching to a Samsung phone. Consequently, Nvidia's competitors will likely face an uphill battle trying to gain traction in AI.\n\nNVDA Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nMoreover, the data in the table above shows the significant financial lead Nvidia has achieved over its competitors. Since last July, Nvidia's operating income and free cash flow have skyrocketed far higher than AMD or Intel's, indicating Nvidia is far more capable of continuing to invest in its business and retain its market dominance.\n\nDespite recent growth, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio sits at less than one, indicating its stock remains a value. Alongside nearly unrivaled dominance in the budding AI market, Nivida is a screaming buy this July and a stock that could make you a millionaire with the right investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "body": "The bull market has raged on through the first half of 2024; the S&P 500 index is up 16% year to date and is sitting at new highs. But there are still plenty of stocks that could head higher in the near term.\n\nThese three Motley Fool contributors see more upside for Carnival (NYSE: CCL), Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Here's why they believe these top stocks are timely buys in July.\n\nThis travel stock is poised to hit new highs\n\nJennifer Saibil (Carnival): Carnival is coming off a rebound year when it completely crushed the market, gaining 130%. You would think it would have to demonstrate some seriously strong performance to keep that up, and so far, so good.\n\nThe market seems to think it's had enough, and Carnival stock is trading down 6% this year. But as it continues to exceed expectations, it shouldn't stay down for much longer.\n\nManagement delivered an excellent update for the 2024 fiscal third quarter (ended May 31), with many metrics hitting new highs, including customer deposits and booking levels.\n\nRevenue hit a second-quarter record of $5.8 billion, and operating income was five times last year's levels. It reported a positive net income of $92 million, $500 million better than last year. Management raised its outlook across the board for the full year.\n\nThere's been concern that Carnival's incredible rebound is a short-term reaction to cruise closures, but demand remains strong, and customers are booking out into 2025. In a classic illustration of supply and demand, Carnival has been able to charge top prices due to high interest and low inventory for longer periods. This is helping it move further out into higher profitability and wipe out more of its debt, which remains high. But it's looking quite likely that it will be able to clear it over the next several years and return to a solid financial position.\n\nManagement is taking a number of actions to improve the business, not only from a financial standpoint. It's investing in the passenger experience with better connectivity and celebrity performances. It has upgraded its planning software and is strategically streamlining its fleet to effectively use its resources.\n\nThese are the kinds of actions that should generate more demand, increased sales, and sustained profits. With Carnival stock still down year to date, investors can get excited about a rebound in the back half of the year.\n\nThis oversold stock looks ready for a comeback\n\nJeremy Bowman (Roku): While the S&P 500 continues to churn to all-time highs, the streaming sector has lagged behind. Entertainment giants like Walt Disney and Warner Bros Discovery are still trading down substantially from their previous highs, and Roku stock has fallen nearly 90% from its peak during the worst of the pandemic.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe industry has undergone a brutal correction after a boom during the pandemic, but there are signs that the correction could be coming to an end. Disney just reported its first-ever profitable quarter in streaming, and a pending merger between Paramount Global and Skydance could also help alleviate some of the competitive pressure in the industry. Meanwhile, digital advertising has begun to recover following a sharp drop during the pandemic.\n\nAll of those developments are good news for Roku. Shares of the streaming distribution leader plunged as its path to profitability under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) looked unclear and revenue growth slowed following a spike during the pandemic, but the underlying metrics in the business remain strong.\n\nStreaming hours jumped 23% year over year in the first quarter to 30.8 billion, and streaming households were up 14% to 81.6 million, showing it's still rapidly gaining new customers. Revenue also rose 19% year over year to $881.5 million, and it reported its third quarter in a row of adjusted profitability in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nRoku has struggled as its media partners have pulled back on advertising spending due to the challenges in the industry, but that should start to change as the streaming platforms take steps to profitability and new launches, like the flagship ESPN streaming network, which is due out next fall.\n\nAs Roku grows its user base and revenue, and the stock price remains down, the buy case gets stronger. As business conditions improve, the bottom line and the stock price should respond in kind.\n\nInvestors should stick with this winner\n\nJohn Ballard (Amazon): Amazon stock has doubled the S&P 500's 24% return over the last 12 months by rising 51%. The stock just recently broke to another new high, which could be a sign of things to come in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe main story for Amazon over the past year has been improving profitability. The company is focused on widening its competitive moat in e-commerce by growing its selection of items while keeping costs down. This has led to improved sales momentum in online retail stores, but most importantly, its cost reduction led its first-quarter operating income to triple over the year-ago quarter to $15 billion.\n\nIt's no surprise to see Wall Street analysts upbeat about Amazon. For example, Wells Fargo sees it reporting better-than-expected financial results in the next earnings report. The bank bumped up its price target on the stock from $234 to $239, implying a 21% upside from the current share price of $197.\n\nThe consensus Wall Street estimate projects Amazon's earnings per share to grow 23% per year over the next several years. Assuming that estimate holds up, it would be enough for the share price to potentially double within the next four years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Carnival Corp. wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Inflation data, Powell speaks, and big banks report earnings: What to know this week",
    "body": "A reading on inflation and the start of second quarter earnings reports will greet investors after a holiday-shortened week that saw stocks close near record highs.\n\nWith job growth slowing, investors will be closely watching the release of June's Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Thursday as the case builds that the Federal Reserve could be set to cut interest rates in September. Semiannual testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday will also be a key focus for investors.\n\nOn the corporate side, Friday morning will see some of America's largest financial institutions, including JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citi (C), kick off second quarter earnings season. Results from PepsiCo (PEP) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) will also be in focus earlier in the week.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose nearly 2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied over 3%. Both finished the week at record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which has been a notable laggard all year, gained a more modest 0.5%.\n\nCase for a September rate cut builds\n\nOn Friday, the June jobs report showed the US economy added more jobs than expected last month. But economists found several signs of a slowing labor market in the details of the report.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 4.1%, its highest level since November 2021. Meanwhile, job gains for April and May were revised lower by 111,000, showing the labor market's robust gains over the past several months weren't as solid as initially thought.\n\nSeveral economists believe this print will lead the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September.\n\n\"The June jobs report showed more signs of cooling in the labor market, with job growth including revisions weaker than expected, the unemployment rate rising and earnings growth slowing,\" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\"Federal Reserve officials have become increasingly focused on the downside risks to the labor market and the June data bolster our forecast for the Fed to cut rates in September and at every other meeting thereafter.\"\n\nRenaissance Macro's head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the report should \"firm up expectations of a September rate cut.\"\n\n\"Economic conditions are cooling and that makes the trade-offs different for the Fed,\" Dutta added, \"Powell should use July to set up a September cut.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of Friday, investors were pricing in a roughly 75% the Fed cuts rates by its September meeting, up from a 64% chance seen the week prior, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nWith Powell set to give his semiannual testimony on Capitol Hill this week, investors will be closely listening for any hints at policy moves ahead of its July 30-31 meeting.\n\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nPrice check\n\nWhile the labor market's slowing has added to the case for Fed rate cuts, inflation remains a key factor.\n\nIn May, inflation readings showed prices increased at their slowest pace of 2024. Powell remarked last week that those readings \"suggest that we are getting back on a disinflationary path.\"\n\nThe first test for whether that path will continue is set for release on Thursday morning with the June CPI report.\n\nWall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 3.1% annually in June, a slowdown from the 3.3% rise seen in May. May's data was the slowest year-over-year inflation reading since July 2022. Prices are set to rise 0.1% on a month-over-month basis, a slight increase from the flat reading seen in May.\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to rise 3.4% over last year in June, unchanged from May. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.2%.\n\n\"We expect the June CPI report to be another confidence builder following the undeniably good May report,\" Bank of America US economist Stephen Juneau wrote in a research note previewing the release.\n\nRead more: Inflation fever breaking? Price hikes on everyday expenses finally ease up.\n\nBig banks set the stage\n\nEarnings season is upon us again, and Financials (XLF) will be in particular focus over the next few weeks; 40% of the S&P 500 companies set to report over that period will be from the sector, according FactSet.\n\nThe sector isn't expected to be a leader in earnings growth this quarter, with analysts forecasting 4.3% year-over-year earnings growth in Q2. This places Financials seventh among the eleven sectors in the S&P 500 for earnings growth.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith recently reported, regional banks remain a key concern for the industry. Regional banks are expected to report a 26% year-over-year decline in earnings growth.\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase logo is seen at their headquarters building on May 26, 2023, in New York City. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nA 'high bar' for Q2 earnings\n\nAfter climbing out of an earnings recession in 2023, corporates are finally facing a new challenge this reporting season: a high bar to beat.\n\nConsensus forecasts are for the S&P 500's earnings to grow 8.8% against the year prior in the second quarter, according to FactSet. This would mark the highest year-over-year earnings growth for the index since the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\"We expect the magnitude of EPS beats to diminish as consensus forecasts set a higher bar than in previous quarters,\" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a client note previewing earnings season.\n\nWith the market trading near record levels ahead of this reporting period, Kostin and other strategists are cautious about how much upside investors can expect if results top Wall Street expectations.\n\nKostin noted that last quarter, companies that beat expectations saw their shares outperform the S&P 500 by 3 basis points in the following day of trading, well below the historical average of 100 basis points.\n\nGiven that investor sentiment is still elevated entering this round of earnings, Kostin reasoned, \"the reward for beats should be smaller than average this quarter, although not as extreme as during the 1Q season.\"\n\nCiti US equity strategist Scott Chronert struck a similar tone, warning that given \"lofty implied growth expectations,\" the prospect of large stock pops this quarter is limited.\n\n\"Markets likely need to see raises coupled with solid execution driven beats to sustain recent gains or push higher from here,\" Chronert wrote in a weekly research note on Friday. \"The concern is while fundamental trends are positive and consensus estimates are attainable, valuations suggest the buy-side will demand more.\"\n\nBroadly, this has Wall Street tampering expectations about how much higher second quarter earnings reports could send a stock market.\n\nResearch from Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha showed that the S&P 500 rises 80% of the time during earnings season, with an average return of 2%.\n\n\"On the other hand,\" Chadha noted, \"the market run up into earnings season and overweight equity positioning argue for a muted rally.\"\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: New York Fed 1-year inflation expectations, June (3.17% prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings releases.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, June (89.9 expected, 90.5 prior); Fed Chair Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nEarnings: Helen of Troy (HELE)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA mortgage applications, July 5, (-2.6% prior), Wholesale inventories month-over-month, May final (0.6% prior); Fed Chair Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee\n\nEarnings: Manchester United (MANU), WD-40 (WDFC), PriceSmart (PSMT)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, +0% previously); CPI excluding food and energy, month-over-month, June (+0.2% expected, +0.2% previously); Consumer Price Index, year-over-year, June (+3.1% expected, +3.3% previously); CPI excluding food and energy, year-over-year, June (+3.4% expected, +3.4% previously); Real Average Hourly Earnings, year-over-year, June (+0.7% previously); Real Average Weekly Earnings, year-over-year, June (+0.5% previously);Initial jobless claims, week ended July 6 (238,000 previously);\n\nEarnings: Conagra Brands (CAG), Delta Air Lines (DAL), PepsiCo (PEP), Progressive (PGR)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Producer Price Index, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, -0.2% previously); PPI, year-over-year, June (+2.2% previously); Core PPI, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, 0% previously); Core PPI, year-over-year, June (+2.3% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, July preliminary (67 expected, 68.2 previously)\n\nEarnings: BNY Mellon (BK), JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

    "title": "45% of Warren Buffett's $398 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
    "body": "Warren Buffett led the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) holding company since 1965. He likes to invest in companies with steady growth, reliable profitability, strong management teams, and shareholder-friendly initiatives like dividend payments and stock buyback programs.\n\nThat strategy is working: Berkshire delivered a 4,384,748% return between 1965 and 2023. That translates to a compound annual gain of 19.8%, which is nearly double the 10.2% annual return of the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same period. In dollar terms, an investment of $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway stock in 1965 would have grown to over $43 million, whereas the same investment in the S&P 500, with dividends reinvested, would be worth just $312,333.\n\nBuffett isn't the type of investor who chases the latest stock market trends, so you won't find him piling into red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) stocks today. But three stocks Berkshire already owns are set to benefit tremendously from AI, and they account for more than 45% of the conglomerate's entire $398.7 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Snowflake: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nSnowflake (NYSE: SNOW) developed its Data Cloud to help businesses aggregate their critical data onto one platform, where it can be analyzed more effectively to extract its maximum value. The service was designed for use by large, complex organizations that work with multiple cloud providers (like Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud), a situation that often leads to the creation of data silos.\n\nThen last year, Snowflake launched its Cortex AI platform, which allows businesses to combine ready-made large language models (LLMs) with their own data to create generative AI applications. Cortex also comes with a suite of AI tools such as Document AI, which allows businesses to extract valuable data from unstructured sources like invoices or contracts, and Snowflake's Copilot virtual assistant, which can be prompted using natural language to provide valuable insights across the Snowflake platform.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2025 first quarter, which ended April 30, Snowflake's product revenue came in at $789.6 million, a 34% increase from the year-ago period. That's a robust growth rate at face value, but it continued a trend of deceleration from prior quarters. Though Snowflake continues to invest heavily in growth initiatives like marketing and research and development, it is acquiring new customers at a slowing rate, and its existing customers are expanding their spending with it more slowly.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway bought its stake in Snowflake around the time of the data cloud specialist's initial public offering in 2020, so it likely paid around $120 per share. The stock soared to as high as $392 in 2021, but it has since declined by 63% from that level and now trades at $142. Unfortunately, due to the company's slowing growth, the stock still appears to be quite expensive, so this is one Berkshire pick investors might want to avoid (for now).\n\n2. Amazon: 0.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock in 2019, and Buffett has often expressed regret that he didn't spot the opportunity sooner. Amazon was founded as an e-commerce company, but it expanded into cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and now, AI.\n\nIts Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division designed its own data center chips which can be up to 50% cheaper for AI developers to use compared to its other infrastructure powered by Nvidia's chips. Plus, the Amazon Bedrock platform offers developers a library of ready-made LLMs from some of the industry's leading start-ups, in addition to a family of LLMs called Titan that Amazon built in-house.\n\nIn essence, AWS wants to become the go-to destination for developers looking to create their own AI applications. Various Wall Street forecasts suggest AI will add anywhere from $7 trillion to $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade, potentially making it Amazon's largest opportunity ever.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns a $2 billion stake in Amazon, representing just 0.5% of the conglomerate's stock portfolio. AI could drive substantial growth for the company over the long term, so if Buffett wished that position was larger before, he might be kicking himself for not adding to it sooner after this next chapter unfolds.\n\n3. Apple: 44.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Berkshire Hathaway's largest position by far. The conglomerate has spent around $38 billion accumulating shares starting in 2016, and its position is now worth $177.6 billion -- even after it sold 13% of its stake (for tax reasons) earlier this year. Apple makes some of the world's most popular devices including the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and the Mac line of computers.\n\nThe company is entering the world of AI with its new Apple Intelligence software, which will be released alongside the iOS 18 operating system in September. It was developed in partnership with OpenAI, and it's set to transform the user experience for Apple's devices. Its Siri voice assistant will lean on the capabilities of ChatGPT, as will its writing tools like Notes, Mail, and iMessage, to help users rapidly craft content.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, meaning this company could soon become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. The upcoming iPhone 16 could drive a significant upgrade cycle, because it is expected to come with a powerful new chip capable of processing AI workloads on-device.\n\nApple ticks all of Buffett's boxes for a stock pick. It has grown steadily since Berkshire first invested in 2016, it's consistently profitable, it has a resolute leader in CEO Tim Cook, and it returns truckloads of money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. In fact, Apple just announced a new buyback program worth $110 billion -- the largest in the history of corporate America.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Snowflake wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "4 Reasons to Buy PepsiCo Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
    "body": "Few companies are as proven and durable as food and beverage giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP). The company has performed for decades, showering investors with dividends and building wealth over generations. The stock has steadily faded in recent weeks and is approaching 52-week lows.\n\nYears of inflation have consumers grappling with higher grocery prices, and sentiment is dropping. Investors have already seen companies like McDonald's cite weaker consumer spending as a headwind to their business.\n\nSo, should investors stay away, or is now the time to buy the stock?\n\nHere are four reasons long-term investors should buy the stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\n1. Best-in-class brands\n\nPepsiCo's world-class food and beverage brands have been its pillar of strength, creating decades of growth and wealth for its shareholders. The stock price has appreciated more than 10,000% over its lifetime, and the dividend has grown over 5,300%. PepsiCo's brands include beverage headliners like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, and Lipton, while its food products include names like Doritos, Cheetos, Lay's, Quaker, and many more.\n\nPEP Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nDominating the grocery aisle means that PepsiCo products get top-tier shelf space in supermarkets and pricing power because consumers generally will buy what they know and love. Additionally, food and beverage products are small ticket items; PepsiCo can get away with bumping the price a few cents because it doesn't dramatically impact consumers' budgets. Decades of population growth and price increases have steadily driven revenue to over $91 billion annually.\n\n2. Still an excellent dividend grower\n\nPepsiCo is a dividend dynamo because it offers yield and growth. Investors buying today get a solid starting yield of 3.3%. On top of that, PepsiCo has raised its dividend by an average of 6.6% for the past five years. Its most recent 7.1% increase shows that management is confident in the company's outlook. Remember, PepsiCo has raised its dividend for 52 consecutive years (a Dividend King), so to maintain inflation-beating dividend growth after all this time is impressive.\n\nNotably, the dividend is well secured by a payout ratio that's 66% of PepsiCo's estimated 2024 earnings. Profits are high enough that PepsiCo can comfortably afford the dividend and still invest in the business or repurchase shares. This consistent growth outpacing inflation is how the stock has performed so well for so long.\n\n3. Solid growth outlook\n\nWhat is most important for investors is whether PepsiCo can continue to grow at this pace. After all, this company, which sells snacks and bottled beverages, is now a $225 billion behemoth. Fortunately, PepsiCo's growth formula still seemingly has mojo left.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe beauty of PepsiCo is its many growth levers. It chugs along as it raises prices, sells more products to a growing global population, and acquires and launches new product brands. Some of PepsiCo's recent hits include newer beverage brands such as Bubly and Starry. It has also invested in the energy drink industry by acquiring Rockstar in 2020 and entering into a major collaboration with Celsius in 2022.\n\nManagement is currently guiding for 4% year-over-year organic revenue growth in 2024 and a 7% increase in earnings per share over 2023. Analysts looking further out expect more of the same. Consensus estimates call for earnings growth averaging over 7% annually for three to five years.\n\n4. Stellar business at a fair price\n\nThe market does silly things sometimes. Weaker consumer spending could put some pricing pressure on PepsiCo, and the stock market is seemingly pricing that into the stock. Shares have now fallen over 17% from their high. PepsiCo has averaged a P/E ratio of almost 26 over the past decade, and shares have now fallen below 20 times this year's estimated earnings:\n\nPEP PE Ratio Chart\n\nDoes the stock deserve to be traded at a discount? While PepsiCo might feel some pressure while consumers are struggling, it's hard to argue that the business is fundamentally worse, especially when the outlook remains consistent with the company's past performance. Do you want to discount the stock? That's already happened. Barring an unexpectedly bad collapse in the business, PepsiCo stock seems like a fantastic business trading at a fair price today.\n\nTo apply Buffett's advice, investors shouldn't hesitate to buy a wonderful business like PepsiCo at a fair price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "2 Biotech Stocks With Big FDA Decisions Approaching \u2013 Here\u2019s What Analysts Expect",
    "body": "There are few sectors that can offer investors massive returns \u2013 but biotech comes to mind as one. These companies are typically involved in the pharmaceutical or medical device industries, and they are famous for their unique combination of high overhead and high product lead times, and even higher profit potential when a new product makes it through the regulatory approval process.\n\nSo biotech stocks can definitely bring the rewards that investors want \u2013 but they are not investments for the risk-averse. It can take years for new drugs or devices to reach the market, the companies generally operate at a loss until then, and there is no guarantee that products will be approved. The key here, as it is in all investing, is to do the homework. For biotechs, that means finding companies with important catalysts coming up in the near term.\n\nWe\u2019ve gotten a start on this process, finding two biotech stocks that have important FDA decisions on the near horizon. According to the latest data from the TipRanks database, both stocks hold Buy ratings from the Street\u2019s analysts \u2013 and both offer solid upside potential, in the triple digits in one case. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nAscendis Pharma (ASND)\n\nAscendis, the first stock we\u2019ll look at, is a company that is in the process of building a marketable drug program based on its unique technology-development platform. This platform is dubbed TransCon, a portmanteau shortening of transient conjugation. Using the platform, a flexible technology that makes use of advanced chemistry, Ascendis can design drug candidates that work by linking the therapeutic agent to an inert carrier compound. The platform is capable of designing new drugs, with novel therapeutics and equally novel delivery mechanisms, that can meet unmet needs in multiple diseases.\n\nThe company\u2019s work is focused mainly on two conditions \u2013 growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults and children, and hypoparathyroidism (PTH), also in adults and children \u2013 and Ascendis has a GHD medication approved and on the market already. The GHD drug, Skytrofa, received its original approval in 2021, and is currently generating revenues in both the US and Europe. The company plans to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA, for use of the drug to treat GHD in adults, during the current 3Q24.\n\nIts hypoparathyroidism drug candidate completed the clinical trial process last year, but is currently facing delays in the approval process. The initial New Drug Application for palopegteriparatide, the TransCon-developed PTH drug, elicited a Complete Response Letter from the FDA in May of last year. The updated NDA was resubmitted in December and given a PDUFA date \u2013 May 14 of this year. On that day, Ascendis announced that the FDA had extended the date by three months, to August 14. That day is rapidly approaching, and marks the next major catalyst for Ascendis.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the meantime, we can look back at the company\u2019s last quarterly report, which covered 1Q24. In that report, Ascendis gave a top line of 95.9 million Euros, for a year-over-year gain of 185%. That total included 65 million Euros in Skytrofa revenue, a figure that was up 106% y/y. The company ran a net loss in the quarter, of 131 million Euros, or 2.30 Euros per share.\n\nThis biotech firm has caught the eye of Stifel analyst Alex Thompson, who sees the TransCon PTH drug as the main factor to bring in investors. He writes of Ascendis, \u201cASND\u2019s TransCon PTH is the key focus of the stock\u2026 We remain confident in the prospects for approval in the US despite multiple delays\u2026 Hypoparathyroidism represents a multi-billion euro commercial opportunity on the backdrop of a growth hormone base business (Skytrofa) that can continue to grow via broader transition of the daily market to weekly and label expansion \u2013 even in the presence of major competitive threats. To that end, we model peak sales for TransCon PTH in Hypoparathyroidism of \u20ac3.0B based on conservative penetration assumptions and Skytrofa sales of \u20ac1.3B, above and in-line/lower than consensus estimates, respectively.\u201d\n\nThese comments back up Thompson\u2019s Buy rating on the stock, and his price target, set at $200, implies an upside of 47% on the one-year horizon. (To watch Thompson\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, these shares have earned 11 recent analyst reviews, including 9 Buys and 2 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $135.81 and its $183.38 average target price suggests that it will gain 35% over the coming year. (See ASND stock forecast)\n\nCitius Pharmaceuticals (CTXR)\n\nNext on our list is Citius, another biopharma company. Citius is devoted to the creation of new treatments for critical care conditions, in both infectious disease and oncology. The company has two drug candidates at late stages of the trial and regulatory processes; these candidates include Lymphir, a new reformulation of denileukin diftitox, and Mino-Lok, an antibiotic lock solution designed to treat bloodstream infections related to catheter use.\n\nBoth of these drugs have high potential in the oncology field. Lymphir is billed as an improvement on an existing drug for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma usually localized on the skin, and catheter-related blood infections are serious \u2013 and frequently life-threatening \u2013 secondary infections to which cancer patients are dangerously susceptible.\n\nOf these two pipeline candidates, Lymphir is the farthest along. Citius submitted the BLA last year, and in July received a Complete Response Letter. The company responded, addressing the FDA\u2019s concerns, and in March of this year received notice that the application had been accepted for review with a PDUFA date of August 13.\n\nWhile that was going on, Citius was also proceeding with the late-stage trials on Mino-Lok, and in May of this year released positive data from the Phase 3 trial of the antibiotic lock. The data release showed that Mino-Lok has achieved both the primary and secondary endpoints in the trial.\n\nMaxim analyst Michael Okunewitch covers this stock, and bases his upbeat take on the progress of Lymphir through the FDA regulatory process, writing, \u201cWe maintain a positive outlook on the [BLA] filing. Recall that the original CRL was based on manufacturing controls and product testing, rather than safety and efficacy. The company has taken steps to address these concerns\u2026\u201d\n\nOkunewitch goes on to outline the potential of Lymphir as a revenue generator, adding of the drug candidate, \u201cOne of the key considerations for assessing the value of Lymphir is to look at the commercial opportunity within cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). There are an estimated 30k-40k patients in the US living with CTCL and ~3k new cases per year. When Ontak was originally on the market in the early 2000s, it generated sales in the range of $30M-$40M per year. However, the market has changed significantly in the years since, and we believe these changes to the treatment landscape have increased the potential market opportunity for Lymphir \u2013 management estimates the opportunity as high as $400M.\u201d\n\nFor the Maxim analyst, this adds up to a Buy rating, while his $4 price target indicates room for a huge one-year upside of 666%. (To watch Okunewitch\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThere are only 2 recent analyst reviews here, but they both agree that this is a stock to Buy, making the Moderate Buy consensus unanimous. The stock is priced at 53 cents per share and its average target price of $4 matches the Maxim view.

    "title": "Thinking About Sinking $100K Into Rental Properties? Consider This Passive Income Option Instead.",
    "body": "Buying a rental property offers the promise of passive income. In theory, the tenants will pay more than enough rent to cover the property's expenses, enabling the landlord to pocket the difference in passive income. In addition to that income, rental property owners can capture tax benefits and property price appreciation.\n\nHowever, rental properties have their drawbacks. The up-front cost can be well over $100,000 when factoring in the down payment, closing costs, and any repairs needed to make the property ready to rent. Meanwhile, the income isn't always passive since you need to manage the property and the tenants. On top of all that, an unexpected vacancy or repair can turn a rental property from a money maker into a money pit.\n\nThere are many alternative ways to generate passive income from real estate. An easy option is to invest in a real estate investment trust real estate investment trust (REIT). These low-cost vehicles enable anyone to collect income backed by real estate. Here are two top REITs to consider.\n\nThe lazy way to be a landlord\n\nMany real estate investors start by owning residential rental properties. They buy single-family homes or duplexes and rent them out to tenants.\n\nWhile being a landlord can be profitable, an easier way to generate passive income from rental housing is to invest in a residential REIT. There are many great ones, including Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT). The company owns 171 communities with over 58,000 rental units in 15 major U.S. markets. It focuses on markets where jobs and the population are growing at above-average rates. That drives demand for housing, keeping occupancy high and rental rates rising.\n\nCamden's rental property portfolio supplies it with steadily rising income to pay dividends. The REIT currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.03 per share ($4.12 annually). With a share price recently around $110, Camden has a dividend yield of around 3.8%. At that rate, every $1,000 invested into Camden would generate about $38 of annual passive income.\n\nThe REIT's dividend payments should steadily rise in the future, driven by rent growth and the company's expanding portfolio. Camden has four new communities under development, including its first two build-to-rent single-family communities. It has the land to build nine more communities, giving it plenty of room to continue growing.\n\nBuild to produce passive income\n\nOne of the great things about REITs is that they open the door to investing in many types of rental properties. For example, Realty Income (NYSE: O) owns a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate, including retail, industrial, gaming, and data center properties. The REIT owns 15,540 single-tenant properties across all 50 states, the U.K., and six other European nations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose properties supply it with very stable rental income that it uses to pay dividends. Realty Income pays a monthly dividend of $0.263 per share ($3.156 annually). With its share price recently around $53, it had a dividend yield of about 5.9%.\n\nRealty Income has an exceptional record of increasing its dividend. Since going public in 1994, it has raised its payout 126 times, including for the last 107 straight quarters.\n\nThe main factor driving that growth is a steady diet of acquisitions. The REIT routinely purchases properties from its operators in sale-leaseback transactions. It will also acquire other REITs and fund development projects. Given that there are trillions of dollars of commercial real estate that it could acquire in the future in its core markets, it has a long growth runway ahead.\n\nEasy ways to generate passive income from real estate\n\nBuying a rental property can be a great way to collect passive income. However, this approach has drawbacks, including a high up-front cost and the need to manage tenants and repairs. REITs provide passive income without those disadvantages, making them ideal options for many beginners. Realty Income and Camden Property are among the best, making them great REITs to buy if you're looking for passive income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Realty Income wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "TipRanks\u2019 \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 Picks: 2 Top-Scoring Stocks for the Second Half of 2024",
    "body": "Now that the first half of the year is fully behind us, we can take its measure \u2013 and what we see illuminates both hopes and risks. On the positive side, the stock markets have posted strong first-half gains; the S&P 500 is up nearly 17% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ has gained 24%. On the negative side, the gains are narrow, and concentrated in the tech sector; semiconductor maker Nvidia, up more than 150% so far this year, alone accounts for approximately one-third of the S&P gains.\n\nThe narrow base alone might not spook investors \u2013 it\u2019s based on the latest AI technologies, which are rapidly proving their worth in new products and services. But it\u2019s also an election year, and as we all know, anything can happen at the polls in November. The recent debate between President Joe Biden and former President Trump, the presumptive challenger, only served to muddy those waters further.\n\nWe can filter out some of those muddy waters with the right tool \u2013 such as the Smart Score, from TipRanks. This AI-based data collection and collation algorithm gathers and sorts the accumulated data of the stock market \u2013 and uses it to rate every stock according to a set of factors that have proven accurate forecasters of future performance. The result is given as a simple score, on a scale of 1 to 10, with the \u2018Perfect 10s\u2019 being stocks that deserve a closer look.\n\nSo let\u2019s give two top-scoring stocks \u2013 \u2018Perfect 10s\u2019 \u2013 just that close look that they deserve. According to the TipRanks database, the Street\u2019s analysts recognize these shares as Strong Buys and are predicting plenty of upside for both. Here are the details.\n\nJanus International Group (JBI)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with a construction-related company, a firm focused on a product that most of us never even think about, although we use it every day: doors. Janus, a design and manufacturing company, provides solutions for doors and entryways to the commercial, industrial, and construction sectors. The company works with builders and contractors, offering a variety of doorway solutions, ranging from basic to high technology. Janus incorporates leading technologies in materials, electronics, and sensors, making sure that its doors are more than simple portals.\n\nGetting to specifics, Janus offers lines of doorways and entry systems for self-storage facilities, light industrial structures, and commercial buildings. These product lines include rolling steel doors, smart entries, hallway systems, and a range of doors made from varying materials and with varying levels of weatherproofing and security protection. Janus typically deals with enterprise clients.\n\nStory continues\n\nJanus is also noted for its Nok\u0113 system, a smart entry system designed to enhance doors and entryways in the self-storage niche. The Nok\u0113 system provides benefits for both storage facility owners and customers, including improved security, automated lock checks, and overlocking processes. Janus advertises this system as one of many it can offer to bring new technological innovations to its best-in-class self-storage door systems.\n\nIn addition to its commitment to providing the best quality in top-end doorway products, Janus is also committed to expanding its footprint in the business. In late May, the company announced that it had acquired Terminal Maintenance and Construction, or TMC, a leading provider of terminal maintenance services in the trucking industry. TMC operates primarily in the Southeast US, and its acquisition will provide support for the expansion of Janus\u2019 Facilitate business division, which provides a full range of facility maintenance services.\n\nEarlier in May, Janus beat expectations when it reported its financial results for 1Q24. The company\u2019s earnings release showed a top line of $254.5 million. While up only 1% from the prior year period, this revenue total was $1.6 million better than had been anticipated. At the bottom line, Janus\u2019 non-GAAP EPS of 21 cents per share was 2 cents above the estimates \u2013 and the total net income of $30.7 million was up more than 18% year-over-year.\n\nThis stock has been covered by Jefferies analyst Philip Ng, who sees plenty of potential here for continued growth. He notes that Janus is executing well on its business, and writes, \u201cDespite a mixed backdrop for self-storage REITs, JBI has seen continued momentum particularly in new construction and its backlogs have remained stable. JBI is delivering solid growth & strong margins, and capital deployment provides good optionality. With the stock trading at 7.0x 2025E EV/EBITDA, we see a path for JBI to re-rate higher now that its float has improved, and it becomes discovered by a broader shareholder base.\u201d\n\nThe five-star analyst goes on to give these shares a Buy rating, with a $20 price target that indicates room for a 63% share appreciation on the one-year horizon. (To watch Ng\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nWhile Janus has only 3 recent analyst reviews, they are unanimously positive \u2013 for a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street. The stock is selling for $12.25, and its $20.50 average target price implies a one-year gain of 67%. (See JBI stock forecast)\n\nAtmus Filtration Technologies (ATMU)\n\nNext on our list, Atmus, is an industrial firm offering a portfolio of high-quality, differentiated filtration solutions on the global market. In short, the company offers a full line of filter and filtration products to a variety of industries, including customers in the fields of agriculture; power generation; rail, marine, and truck transport; mining, oil, and gas extraction \u2013 it is a long list, as Atmus boasts hundreds of thousands of end users.\n\nAtmus started out, and for a long time remained, a subsidiary of the major diesel engine firm Cummins. In May of 2023, Cummins began the process of spinning Atmus off as a fully independent entity; that process was completed earlier this year, when Cummins sold off its remaining interest in the filtration firm.\n\nAs an independent operator, Atmus can boast a market cap of $2.38 billion. The company is a leader in filtration technology, and protects its product portfolio and intellectual property with more than 1,250 patents \u2013 active or pending \u2013 worldwide, as well as some 600 trademark registrations and applications. The company\u2019s filtration tech is used in a wide range of fuel, lubricant, and air systems, connected to a variety of engines and power plants. Atmus has 5 technical centers and 10 manufacturing facilities, and saw more than $1.6 billion in sales last year.\n\nAtmus recently reported its 1Q24 results, its fourth financial release since its stock first went public last year. At the top line, the company reported $427 million in revenue, while at the bottom line it reported non-GAAP earnings of 60 cents per share.\n\nNorthland analyst Bobby Brooks covers Atmus, and he explains why investors should pay attention here: \u201cATMU\u2019s Fleetguard is the premier brand for emission/efficiency parts in medium/heavy duty, on/off-highway vehicles. ATMU split off from CMI (NR) last year, with CMI exiting its remaining stake this March. Ultimately, we think ATMU\u2019s extremely macro-resilient business, upside to accelerating top-line growth, margin expansion opportunities post-split, and clean BS create a compelling investment case.\u201d (To watch Brooks\u2019 track record, click here.)\n\nTo this end, Brooks gives the shares an Outperform (Buy) rating, with a $36 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 26%.\n\nZooming out a bit, we find that ATMU shares have acquired 6 recent analyst reviews \u2013 and that they are all positive, giving the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $28.55, and their average price target, $36.17, suggests that the stock has room to gain 27% over the next 12 months.

    "title": "Trump tax cuts not a guaranteed jolt to the markets: Wall Street pros",

The US federal debt currently totals over $34 trillion, and the government is expected to spend nearly $900 billion on interest payments in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

    "title": "Rivian Just Made a Game-Changing Move. Here's What You Need to Know",
    "body": "Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) has been a tough stock to own since its initial public offering (IPO). The electric vehicle (EV) maker went public at $78 per share on Nov. 10, 2021, and set a record high of $172.01 less than a week later, but currently trades at about $15.\n\nRivian initially impressed investors because it was already producing thousands of vehicles and was backed by Amazon and Ford Motor Company. Unfortunately, its stock crumbled as it missed it own production targets, racked up steep losses, and lost Ford as a leading investor. Rising interest rates also popped its bubbly valuation.\n\nImage source: Rivian.\n\nBut on June 25, Rivian announced a new joint venture (JV) with Volkswagen (OTC: VWAP.Y) to co-develop new EV technologies. Many bullish investors praised the partnership as a game-changing move for Rivian, and its stock has soared more than 30% since its opening price that day. Let's see what this deal might mean for Rivian's future.\n\nHow Rivian and Volkswagen can help each other\n\nRivian and Volkswagen's joint venture will be equally owned and controlled by both companies. It will use Rivian's zonal hardware design and integrated technology platform as a foundation to develop new software-defined vehicles (SDVs) for both companies. Rivian will license its intellectual property to the JV.\n\nFor now, Volkswagen will start using Rivian's existing electric architecture and software platform to build new EVs. But by the \"second half of the decade,\" both companies plan to launch new vehicles created from the JV's co-developed technologies. A recent rumor also suggested Rivian was in early talks with Volkswagen to expand their software partnership into a manufacturing one, but Rivian refuted those claims.\n\nVolkswagen plans to invest up to $5 billion in Rivian and the JV. It already bought $1 billion of Rivian's notes, which will be converted to its common shares on Dec. 1, and it plans to make two additional tranches of $1 billion investments in 2025 and 2026. It will also invest $1 billion in the JV upon its inception and provide it with a $1 billion loan in 2026.\n\nThat big investment isn't too surprising given Volkswagen remains an underdog in the EV market. Its sales of battery-powered EVs rose nearly 35% to more than 771,000 units in 2023, but that was only equivalent to 8% of the global EV market and less than half of Tesla's 1.81 million deliveries. Therefore, it makes sense for Volkswagen to invest in smaller EV makers like Rivian to accelerate that higher-growth business.\n\nIt's all about the cash\n\nAs for Rivian, that investment should allay some concerns about its cash flows and future projects. It still needs to open its $5 billion plant in Georgia; ramp up its production of its own Enduro drive units to boost its gross margins; launch its R2, R3, and R3X SUVs in 2026 and 2027; and fulfill Amazon's long-term order for 100,000 electric delivery vans through 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivian ended the first quarter of 2024 with $9.05 billion in total liquidity, but analysts expect it to post a net loss of $4.69 billion for the full year. Therefore, Volkswagen's big investment should buy it a lot more time to achieve its long-term goals. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said the partnership would secure its \"capital needs for substantial growth.\"\n\nRivian still looks undervalued\n\nRivian expects its annual production to nearly flatline at 57,000 vehicles this year as it faces tougher macro headwinds, more competition, and a temporary shutdown of its main plant in Normal, Illinois, to upgrade its production capabilities. But it's still aiming to achieve a positive gross margin per vehicle by the fourth quarter of this year as economies of scale kick in.\n\nAnalysts believe Rivian can increase its revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% from 2023 to 2026 as it rolls out its new vehicles. With an enterprise value of $12.6 billion, it still looks fundamentally cheap at just 3 times this year's sales. Tesla, which is growing at a much slower rate, trades at 8 times this year's sales.\n\nIf Rivian can get its act together, ramp up its production, and avoid more delays and disappointments, it could fetch a much higher valuation in the future. Volkswagen's investment is a vote of confidence in its ability to achieve those goals -- and Rivian could generate big multibagger gains over the next few years if it overcomes its more pressing challenges.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Companies Paid Their Investors $16 Billion More in Dividends Last Quarter. These 2 Magnificent Stocks Helped Drive the Increase.",
    "body": "Companies have been increasingly generous in distributing a portion of their profits to shareholders over the past year. U.S. companies paid a net $16 billion more in dividends during the second quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That was slightly more than the net increase in the first quarter and about four times higher than in the prior-year period.\n\nMany companies contributed to the increase by initiating a dividend or raising their payout. However, two companies stood out as the biggest drivers of the boost in dividend payments last quarter: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Here's a closer look at these two magnificent dividend stocks.\n\nA monster dividend\n\nTech titan and \"Magnificent Seven\" member Alphabet initiated a regular quarterly dividend in late April. It made its first payment of $0.20 per share in mid-June.\n\nAlphabet's initial dividend seems small relative to its stock price (it currently has a 0.4% dividend yield, well below the S&P 500's 1.3% yield). However, it's massive on an absolute basis. It will cost the company about $10 billion per year. That made it the most meaningful contributor to the second quarter's increase in dividend payments.\n\nThe technology giant can easily afford that monster payment. The company generated $16.8 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter alone. It also had $108 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet against a mere $13.2 billion of long-term debt. That strong financial position enabled the company to add a whopping $70 billion to its share repurchase program.\n\nAlphabet's initial dividend is likely only the starting point. Given the company's financial strength and earnings growth (more than 50% in the first quarter), it should be able to steadily increase its dividend payment in the future.\n\nAnother magnificent dividend\n\nAlphabet's dividend initiation followed in the footsteps of fellow Magnificent Seven member Meta Platforms, which initiated a dividend during the first quarter. The social media giant is paying $0.50 per share each quarter.\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta Platforms' dividend might seem small at first glance, given its low 0.4% dividend yield. However, its total payments will tally a massive $4.4 billion per year. That's the second-highest absolute dividend increase this year, more than double the newly minted dividends of Salesforce ($1.5 billion) and Booking Holdings ($1.2 billion). Add that trio to Alphabet's recently initiated payment, and 53% of this year's net increase in dividends has come from those four new dividend stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms can also easily afford to pay its mammoth dividend. The company generated $12.5 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter and had $58.1 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet. The company's robust financial position is giving it the flexibility to invest heavily in AI while also returning generous amounts of cash to shareholders through its recently initiated dividend and share repurchase program (Meta bought back $14.6 billion in shares during the first quarter while paying about $1.3 billion in dividends).\n\nThe company is in an excellent position to increase its dividend in the future. In addition to its strong financial profile, Meta's earnings are growing briskly (over 110% increase in the first quarter). The company's heavy investment in AI could drive robust future growth.\n\nCompanies are doling out more dividends\n\nCompanies in the S&P 500 are on track to pay 6% more in dividends this year. That's an acceleration from last year's increase (5.2%), thanks in part to the recently initiated dividends from Magnificent Seven members Meta Platforms and Alphabet.\n\nThat upward trend in dividend payments appears likely to continue. Many companies, especially large technology companies, are flush with cash and briskly growing their free cash flow. That puts them in an excellent position to continue lining their investors' pockets with higher dividend payments. So, if you're looking to make some extra money, investing in dividend stocks could be your ticket to a steadily rising passive income stream.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Euro falls as markets brace for French post-election gridlock",
    "body": "By Harry Robertson and Dhara Ranasinghe\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -The euro slipped on Sunday after projections from France's election pointed to a hung parliament and an unexpectedly strong showing for the left-wing New Popular Front, casting fresh uncertainty over markets and setting the stage for further volatility ahead.\n\nAnalysts said markets would likely be relieved that Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) was forecast to come third after last week's first-round victory.\n\nYet investors also have concerns that the French left\u2019s plans could unwind many of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pro-market reforms. And they believe political gridlock could end attempts to rein in France's debt, which stood at 110.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023.\n\nThe euro fell 0.2% to $1.081 as the week\u2019s trading got underway. It had climbed last week as opinion polls suggested a hung parliament was likely, assuaging fears of a far right victory, after dropping sharply - along with stocks and bonds - when Macron called the elections in early June.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the anti-far right parties really got a lot of support,\u201d said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe.\n\n\u201cBut fundamentally from a market perspective, there\u2019s no difference in terms of the outcome. There\u2019s really going to be a vacuum when it comes to France\u2019s legislative ability.\"\n\nHarvey added: \"The bond market is going to be the real place to look at. There might be a bit of a gap lower in French bonds (prices).\"\n\nTrading in French bonds and stocks will begin on Monday morning in Europe.\n\nThe leftist alliance, which gathers the hard left, the Socialists and Greens, was forecast to win between 172 and 215 seats out of 577, according to pollsters' projections based on early results from a sample of polling stations.\n\nMacron\u2019s centrist alliance was projected to win 150-180 seats, with the RN seen getting 115 to 155 seats.\n\nAnalysts said a period of volatility and uncertainty was expected to continue as investors now assess what form the parliament will take, and how many, if any, of its policies the leftist alliance will be able to implement.\n\nThe New Popular Front alliance says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%. \"The economic programme of the left is in many ways much more problematic than that of the right, and while the left will not be able to govern on their own, the outlook for French public finances deteriorates further with these results,\" said Nordea chief market analyst Jan von Gerich.\n\nStory continues\n\nJITTERY MARKETS\n\nMarkets tumbled after Macron gambled in June by calling a parliamentary election following a trouncing at the hands of the RN in European Parliament elections - as investors worried an RN victory could install a prime minister intent on a high-spending, France-first agenda that would exacerbate a large debt pile and shake relations with Europe.\n\nThe risk premium investors demand to hold the country's debt soared to its highest level since the euro zone crisis in 2012. French stocks, led by banks, dropped as investors worried about their holdings of government debt, new regulation and economic uncertainty in the euro area's second biggest economy.\n\nYet equities, bonds and the euro all recovered somewhat last week as polls showed a hung parliament was the most likely outcome as the left wing and centrist parties struck deals to give anti-RN candidates a better chance.\n\nThe exact make-up of the next parliament remains uncertain, as does the next prime minister. Gabriel Attal said he would hand his resignation to Macron on Monday.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to be very hard to actually go ahead and pass any policy and bring about any progressive reforms because each party\u2019s vote is split and no one has an absolute majority,\u201d said Aneeka Gupta, director of macroeconomic research at WisdomTree.\n\nYet she added: \"I think the markets will be happy we\u2019re avoiding this extreme situation with the far right.\"\n\n(Reporting by Harry Robertson and Dhara RanasingheEditing by Elisa Martinuzzi and Frances Kerry)",
    "summary": "Yet investors also have concerns that the French left\u2019s plans could unwind many of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pro-market reforms.\nAnd they believe political gridlock could end attempts to rein in France's debt, which stood at 110.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023.\nThere might be a bit of a gap lower in French bonds (prices).\"\nTrading in French bonds and stocks will begin on Monday morning in Europe.\nYet she added: \"I think the markets will be happy we\u2019re avoiding this extreme situation with the far right.\"",

    "body": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nI have always found it amusing to put stock market outlooks in the context of personal life experiences.\n\nAnd I have a new one to share with you dedicated Morning Brief readers today.\n\nWhile I was running outside on July 4 in 90-degree weather in barefoot footwear as part of an obsessive workout regimen, I had a few passing thoughts on the direction of stocks going into the November presidential election.\n\nThe outlook reminds me of those childhood times when I did something bad, and my dad sought to discipline me. I would always run to the closet and close the door, somehow reasoning he wouldn't find me in there next to my Transformers and Ninja Turtles toys.\n\nTime after time, I was wrong \u2014 he found me, and I learned in those moments that there was truly nowhere to hide.\n\nThat's what investors are facing in the lead-up to the presidential election, pros tell me.\n\n\"My simplistic answer is the US is just so supersized and enormous that if the US doesn't work [around the election], there are very, very few places to hide,\" Bradesco head of equity strategy Ben Laidler said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above or listen here).\n\nAdded Laidler, \"I can come up with one or two. Maybe China is one. But, you know, there are very few places to hide.\"\n\nThis really makes a lot of sense to me.\n\nAre you going to cash out of 50% of your super profitable Nvidia (NVDA) position by the end of the summer and go all in on Europe with the view it will be less volatile? Come on.\n\nThe European Union's first quarter GDP increased by a paltry 0.3% quarter on quarter. Fourth quarter GDP was revised down to a negative 0.1% from a previous 0%. The EU was in a technical recession in the second half of 2023!\n\nNo real growth acceleration in the EU is expected from here.\n\nInflation in the EU remains omnipresent, prompting ECB president Christine Lagarde to push back on expectations of another interest rate cut this year. The ECB delivered its quarter-point cut at its June 6 meeting.\n\nThe takeaway is that Europe lacks catalysts.\n\nLet's take a brief look at China.\n\nChina's first quarter GDP rose 5.3%, but investment in property and developments tanked by 9.5%. One industrial CEO recently told me they do not expect their business in China to inflect until later in 2025.\n\nA former high-ranking Cabinet member of the George W. Bush presidency detailed a recent Chinese trip to me a few weeks ago. They were surprised by the negative tones among Chinese consumers and fear there is surprising economic downside ahead due to pressured household budgets.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of that aligns with lackluster sales in China recently from consumer giants Nike (NKE) and Levi's (LEVI).\n\nSo China and Europe are off the table.\n\n\"We have already witnessed sharp market reactions around elections in India, Mexico, and France,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner reminded clients in a note.\n\nSo much for those countries.\n\nMaybe bitcoin shakes off its latest sell-off and catches a pre-election bid as a hedge on ballooning deficits hurting US dollar credibility.\n\nBut who knows.\n\n\"The election is one of the ingredients of this wall of worry that I think the market is just going to keep climbing, along with inflation and recession fears,\" Laidler added.\n\nHardly comforting.\n\nJust like I did as a kid, you are going to have to suck up any pain in markets brought on by the Biden vs. Trump chaos. The reality is there is nowhere to hide.\n\nThe long-term bull trend in markets remains intact, said Wall Street's \"Einstein,\" Peter Tuchman.

    "title": "Better Megacap Stock: Nvidia vs. Microsoft",
    "body": "Let's face it: 2024 has been all about the megacaps. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 147% year to date; Meta Platforms is up 44%; Alphabet is up 33%.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms now boast a combined market cap of $15.6 trillion. That's roughly equivalent to the size of the Eurozone economy, which has an annual gross domestic product of $15.4 billion, according to the latest estimates from the World Bank.\n\nSo, let's compare two of the best megacaps, Nvidia and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), to see which is better positioned to rule the second half of 2024 -- and beyond.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nNo company has experienced a more remarkable growth in its market cap over the past two years than Nvidia. The semiconductor giant has added a staggering $2.7 trillion in value, catapulting it to the position of the most valuable company on Earth, if only briefly.\n\nIts rise is almost entirely thanks to the surge in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and the hardware behind it. Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs). These powerful devices are often linked together by the thousands -- even hundreds of thousands -- within data centers to help train the latest and greatest AI models.\n\nWhile there are other companies in the GPU design space, Nvidia enjoys several key competitive advantages. The trust and familiarity AI developers have with Nvidia's GPUs and its software make it challenging for them to switch to another supplier. Moreover, Nvidia's extensive experience in GPU design prior to the AI boom gives it a unique edge over its competitors.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite the attention garnered by Nvidia's rapid ascent, it's important not to overlook Microsoft's impressive stock performance. The company once again holds the title of the most valuable company on Earth, a position it regained after briefly being overtaken by Nvidia. To maintain this lead, Microsoft is demonstrating its adaptability to the evolving tech landscape, particularly the AI revolution.\n\nOn that front, Microsoft has already begun integrating AI into its signature software applications. It now offers a generative AI assistant through its Microsoft Copilot add-on, which can analyze data, respond to queries, create images, and generate code.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft diverse business segments provide a layer of protection, should the AI revolution falter. The company has a massive cloud services unit and a successful gaming division among various other business segments.\n\nWhich stock is a better buy in the second half of 2024?\n\nSimply put, both Nvidia and Microsoft are outstanding companies. They generate billions in revenue, profits, and free cash flow. They're also led by some of the top CEOs on the planet: Satya Nadella at Microsoft and Jensen Huang at Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, there are differences to evaluate.\n\nFor one, Nvidia's valuation is approaching record highs. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is now 39x -- more than double its 10-year average of 15x.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's P/S ratio is also historically high at 14x. However, that value is less than half of Nvidia's on an absolute basis.\n\nMSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nIn other words, both stocks are historically expensive, but Nvidia is far more costly in a head-to-head comparison.\n\nAt any rate, the rapid growth of the GPU market is what investors are counting on to bring Nvidia's valuation down. And while those growth estimates are impressive (analysts expect Nvidia's sales to rise 98% over last year), any signs of slowing growth could lead to a sharp sell-off in Nvidia shares.\n\nIn conclusion, I prefer Microsoft, given the stock's more reasonable valuation at current levels. That said, long-term Nvidia investors shouldn't bail on the stock now. Rather, they should remember that one of the keys to successful buy-and-hold investing is to let winners run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Hedge Funds That Piled Into Big Tesla Short Stung by Huge Rally",
    "body": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Hedge funds piled into short bets against Tesla Inc. (TSLA) right before the electric vehicle maker unveiled a set of numbers that triggered a hefty share-price rally.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAbout 18% of the 500-plus hedge funds tracked by data provider Hazeltree had an overall short position on Tesla at the end of June, the highest percentage in more than a year, according to figures shared with Bloomberg. That compares with just under 15% at the end of March.\n\nThose contrarian bets now threaten to saddle the hedge funds behind them with losses. Tesla\u2019s latest vehicle-sales results, published on July 2, revealed second-quarter deliveries figures that beat average analyst estimates, even though sales were down. Investors pounced on the news, driving the company\u2019s shares to a six-month high. Since the beginning of June, Tesla\u2019s share price has now soared about 40%.\n\nTesla is likely to see its profit margins improve, helped by lower production and raw material costs, according to Morningstar Inc.\u2019s Seth Goldstein, one of the top three analysts covering the stock in a Bloomberg ranking that tracks price recommendations.\n\nThe company will likely \u201creturn to profit growth\u201d next year, he said in a note to clients. But how Tesla handles the market\u2019s intensifying focus on affordable EVs will be key, he added.\n\nThe development feeds into an ongoing sense of uncertainty around how to treat the wider EV market, amid a sea of conflicting dynamics. The industry \u2014 a key plank in the global race to reach net zero emissions by 2050 \u2014 benefits from generous tax credits. Yet it\u2019s also contending with significant hurdles in the form of tariff wars and even identity politics, with some consumers rejecting EVs as a form of \u201cwoke\u201d transport.\n\nIn the US, Donald Trump has said that if he becomes president again after November\u2019s election, he\u2019ll undo existing laws supporting battery-powered vehicles, calling them \u201ccrazy.\u201d That said, Trump is a \u201chuge fan\u201d of Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, according to Elon Musk, the EV giant\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nMeanwhile, the list of internal disruptions at Tesla is long. In April, Musk told staff to brace for major job cuts, with sales roles among those affected. And the Cybertruck, Tesla\u2019s first new consumer model in years, has been slow to ramp up.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor that reason, some hedge fund managers have decided the stock is off bounds altogether. Tesla is \u201cvery difficult for us to position,\u201d said Fabio Pecce, chief investment officer at Ambienta where he oversees $700 million, including managing the Ambienta x Alpha hedge fund.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s not clear whether investors are dealing with \u201ca top company with a great management team\u201d or whether it\u2019s \u201ca challenged franchise with deficient corporate governance,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, \u201cif Trump wins, it is truly going to be very positive\u201d for Tesla, though \u201cobviously not amazing for EVs and renewables in general,\u201d he said. That\u2019s because Trump is expected to impose \u201cmassive tariffs towards the Chinese players,\u201d which would be \u201cbeneficial\u201d to Tesla, Pecce said.\n\nInvestors ended 2023 declaring they\u2019d likely retreat further from green stocks in general, and EVs specifically, according to a Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey. Almost two-thirds of the 620 respondents said they planned to stay away from the EV sector, with close to 60% expecting the iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund to extend its slide in 2024. The ETF has lost 13% so far this year after sinking more than 20% in 2023.\n\nThe Bloomberg Electric Vehicles Price Return Index, whose members include BYD Co., Tesla and Rivian (RIVN) Automotive Inc., is down about 22% so far in 2024. At the same time, the metals and minerals needed to produce batteries are at the mercy of wildly volatile commodities markets, with speculators regularly trying to make a quick buck on shifts in supply and demand. Price volatility means some battery manufacturers are having to adjust to a market in which their profit margins have been getting badly squeezed.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, more traditional automakers are finding themselves under pressure from shareholders to slow down their capital expenditure on EVs, with recent examples including Porsche AG. Polestar Automotive Holding UK Plc (PSNY), a high-end EV manufacturer, has lost almost 95% of its value since being spun out of Volvo Car AB two years ago. Fisker Inc., another luxury EV maker, saw its value wiped out starting last year and has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nSoren Aandahl, founder and CIO of Texas-based Blue Orca Capital, said \u201cvaluations in the EV space are so beat up\u201d that he\u2019s now avoiding shorting the sector. It\u2019s no longer an obvious contrarian bet, because those tend to do best if investors enter \u201cwhen things are a little bit higher,\u201d he said. But at this point, \u201ca lot of the air\u2019s already come out of the balloon.\u201d\n\nBut Eirik Hogner, deputy portfolio manager at $2.7 billion hedge fund Clean Energy Transition, suggests there may be more pain to come for the wider EV industry. There are still \u201cway too many\u201d startups that remain \u201csub-scale\u201d and with gross margins that are simply \u201ctoo low,\u201d he said. As a result, the supply-demand dynamic of the EV market \u201cis still very negative.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, I think you need to see more bankruptcies\u201d before the market starts to look healthier, Hogner said.\n\n\u2014With assistance from Craig Trudell.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "title": "Forget Amazon: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
    "body": "Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) hit an all-time high this week after rising 53% over the last 12 months. The company has rallied Wall Street with multiple quarters of stellar financial growth and an expanding role in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon Web Services' (AWS) dominance in the cloud industry grants the company a promising position in AI, as more and more businesses turn to such platforms for their AI needs. Meanwhile, the company has announced a venture into chip design. Amazon has an exciting outlook in AI and would likely make an asset to any portfolio over the long term. However, its stock growth over the last year hasn't exactly matched its earnings growth, meaning its shares are slightly overpriced for now.\n\nAMZN PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis table shows Amazon has the highest price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow ratios out of some of the most prominent names in AI software. The figures suggest Amazon is currently one of the worst-valued stocks among its peers.\n\nHowever, two companies stand out as bargain buys in the space, indicating they could be worth considering over Amazon: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). These tech giants are investing heavily in AI and could see significant gains as the industry develops.\n\nSo, forget Amazon and consider buying these two artificial intelligence stocks now.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is a no-brainer at its current price point. The company has delivered significant earnings and stock growth over the last year, yet is trading at a bargain price compared to its peers. Meanwhile, Alphabet has the brand power, tech, and cash reserves to go far in AI.\n\nThe company's Google Cloud platform holds an 11% market share in cloud computing, compared to AWS' 31%. It's the third-largest cloud company after Amazon and Microsoft. However, it's outpacing both in growth.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Google Cloud revenue jumped 28% year over year. Comparatively, the same period saw AWS sales rise by 17% and Microsoft Azure's revenue increase by 21%.\n\nAlphabet is investing billions in AI and is in a solid position to build a lucrative AI ecosystem around its products. As the home of potent brands like Android, YouTube, and the many services under Google, Alphabet has countless opportunities to boost its business with AI. The company has the potential to offer more efficient digital advertising, add generative features to its smartphone operating system, better track viewing trends on YouTube, and create a Google Search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOOGL Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows Alphabet is a thoroughly reliable stock. Over the last five years, it has beaten Amazon in stock and free cash flow growth. Meanwhile, it has delivered a similar rise in operating income. In addition to its far better-valued share price, Alphabet is a screaming buy right now and a better AI stock than Amazon.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple's stock has risen 14% since Jan. 1. The figure is considerably lower than its peers, with Amazon's and Alphabet's stocks rising more than 30% during that time. Apple missed out on the initial boom in AI, preferring to take a more gradual approach to the market. However, recent developments suggest it could come back strong in the coming years.\n\nBloomberg reported on Jul. 2 that Apple is poised to get an observer role on ChatGPT developer OpenAI's board. The move follows an announcement at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in June that revealed its smart assistant Siri will receive a major AI overhaul, making it more intuitive and able to answer hundreds of new questions. Siri will now pass off certain questions to ChatGPT as part of the update, making the OpenAI platform available to users through its iPhones, iPads, or Macs.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, \"The board observer role will put Apple on par with Microsoft Corp., OpenAI's biggest backer, and its main AI technology provider.\" Apple has been in steep competition with Microsoft for years, with both leaders in consumer tech and responsible for the two most used computer operating systems. As a result, Apple's seat at OpenAI's table could bring its AI technology more in line with its rival and boost its entire position in the industry.\n\nAAPL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThis table shows that Apple is potentially better financially equipped than Amazon or Microsoft to expand in AI. The company is a cash cow, with far more free cash flow and operating income over the last five years. So, despite its slower approach to AI, I wouldn't be against it carving out a lucrative position in the sector over the long term.\n\nAlongside its better-valued stock price, Apple is worth considering over Amazon stock this July.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Despite this admiration, Munger and Berkshire Hathaway were notably late in investing in Amazon.\n\nMunger\u2019s hesitation to invest in Amazon was rooted in the company\u2019s complexity and the uncertainties that surrounded it. \"It's always been too complicated and uncertain for my particular temperament,\" Munger said.\n\nHe emphasized his preference for investments where outcomes could be predicted with a high degree of accuracy. This conservative approach has been a cornerstone of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s investment strategy, focusing on businesses with clear, stable trajectories.\n\nThis cautiousness led to a missed opportunity, one that Munger acknowledged with a hint of regret.

    "title": "On Wall Street bearish investors are out of favor\u2014but there\u2019s mounting evidence they are right about the stock market outlook",
    "body": "In late May, JP Morgan's Marko Kolanovic defended his stubborn, negative stance on the U.S. stocks, asserting that the S&P 500 was substantially overvalued, and predicted that the big cap index would end the year at 4200, down 24% from its level at the time. By then, Kolanovic was the last bearish market strategist at a major Wall Street bank; all the others, even the previously dour ones, were predicting more gains by year end on the view that the fabulous resurgence that started in early 2023 would just keep rolling.\n\nKolanovic had also been wrong in 2022 when he foresaw great things for equities, and the markets tanked. It appears that missing by a wide margin on back-to-back forecasts, over two-and-a-half years, cost him his job. But does his analysis of the market's fundamentals was wrong? Not at all.\n\nIn fact, the circumstances surrounding his departure carry two lessons. First, extremely short-term calls on the direction of equities are worthless. Second, history shows that episodes of inflated prices can go on a long time\u2014but that the gravitational forces that govern earnings growth and PE multiples over extended periods always eventually take hold, and carry the day.\n\nDespite the great bull run and the exit of skeptics like Kolanovic who so far got it wrong, equities do look dangerously pricey\n\nIn his most recent report, Kolanovic stated that stock prices were simply incorporating much higher earnings growth than he deemed reasonable. It's a good argument. For Q1 of this year, S&P 500 net profits, based on the last four quarters, stood at $192. That's 38% higher than the pre-pandemic record of $140 set at the close of 2019. The famous CAPE model developed by Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller strongly implies that the $192 number is unsustainable, and that a \"baseline\" for earnings is more like $155.\n\nThe rub: Even though profits hover at extremely lofty levels, what investors are paying for each dollar of those possible unrepeatable earnings is also immense. The S&P's current multiple stands at 28.9. Except during the Great Financial Crisis when profits collapsed, that's the highest PE for any quarter since the tech bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. And over the past 36 years, the S&P's PE has only been that high for just five months, all during this century's most notorious craze.\n\nThat episode is a reminder that prices can break free of anything justified by the basics for years, so while that's happening, predictions of an imminent fall are always wrong\u2014until they're finally and inevitably right. Put simply, though the outcome's predictable, the timing is anything but. By June of 2017, the Shiller model was flashing red, indicating that that the S&P had swung into the super-rich zone. Yet through August of 2000, a stretch of over three years, the index gained another 79%, rising from 847 to 1517. By February of 2003, the S&P made a virtual round trip to 841, and didn't breach 1500 once again until a decade later.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdjust the numbers according to basic market math, and they're at least as scary as those the JP Morgan bear advanced\n\nLet's say that the market PE trends downward from its current level of nearly 29, to 22, still elevated by historical standards. That shift would lower the index 25% from where it stands now, about the correction Kolanovic predicted. Or, it's highly possible that EPS will trend downwards and settle at the $155, adjusted for inflation, that looks justifiable from the Shiller data. It already appears that the gigantic profits booked in the post-COVID recovery aren't durable; the 500's EPS has gone flat, and dropped in real terms, since Q4 of 2021. If profits drop to the $150-160 range, after accounting for inflation, even at a big PE of 27, the S&P's 25% too pricey at its record of 5567 at the close on July 5th.\n\nKeep mind that low interest rates should be great for stocks because they raise the present value of future earnings, and higher real yields are a downer since they reduce what that stream's worth today. Well, \"real yields\" have jumped from negative to over 2% while the S&P's soared. The combination of historically high PEs, probably inflated earnings, and real rates that just went from extremely favorable to normal, aren't a combination that should breed confidence that stocks will keep climbing. They're more like the cocktail for a tough hangover.\n\nOnce again, the bulls could be right for awhile. But for a much longer period, the science tells us that when you're starting at these big prices, you'll get pocket poor returns over the next seven or even five years. A bet for where we'll be this time next year is no better than a guess. But the more the market booms, the more it sows the seeds of its own demise.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought",
    "body": "Cathie Wood, the founder of Ark Invest, is one of the market's most closely followed growth investors. But over the past five years, her flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKK) has declined nearly 6% as the S&P 500 rallied 85%.\n\nNevertheless, Wood contends that her focus on long-term secular trends will pay off for patient investors who can tune out the near-term noise. So let's look at three of her recent purchases -- Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Roblox (NYSE: RBLX), and PagerDuty (NYSE: PD) -- and see if they're worthwhile buys for growth investors.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Roku\n\nCathie Wood bought 245,896 shares of Roku, which currently have a market value of about $15 million, for the Ark Innovation ETF in June. Those purchases increase the ETF's total stake in Roku to $562 million, making it the fund's second largest holding after Tesla, with a total weight of 9.2%.\n\nHowever, Roku's stock has declined 34% over the past five years. The bulls retreated as its growth cooled off and it faced tougher competitors in the streaming market.\n\nRoku's revenue rose more than 50% in both 2020 and 2021 as the pandemic drove more consumers to buy its streaming video devices and consume more content, but its revenue grew only 13% in 2022 and just 11% in 2023 as those tailwinds dissipated. Analysts expect its revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of only 12% from 2023 to 2026.\n\nYet Roku is still gaining more active accounts as its streaming hours continue to rise. That expansion should drive the growth of its higher-margin platform business and offset the negative gross margin of its hardware player business.\n\nMoreover, its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned positive in 2023 as it aggressively cut costs, and analysts expect that figure to grow at a CAGR of 347% over the next three years. That's a decent outlook for a stock which trades at 29 times next year's adjusted EBITDA.\n\n2. Roblox\n\nWood scooped up 1.53 million shares for Roblox, which are worth $57 million today, for the Ark Innovation ETF in May and June. It now owns a $344 million stake in Roblox, making it the fund's the fourth largest holding, with a total weight of 5.6%.\n\nRoblox's gaming platform enables its users to create, share, and monetize their own video games with a simple block-based system without any coding knowledge. That simple approach made it popular with tween users during the pandemic.\n\nIts bookings surged 171% in 2020 and grew another 45% in 2021, but rose only 5% in 2022 as its core audience went back to school. That deceleration challenged the bullish belief that its creator-driven flywheel would generate consistent long-term gains, and its stock has declined more than 40% since its direct listing debut in March 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet Roblox's bookings grew 23% in 2023, as its growth in daily active users and hours engaged -- driven by its rising popularity among older and overseas users -- offset its nearly flat growth in average bookings per daily active user.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect its bookings to grow at a CAGR of 16% as its adjusted EBITDA rises at a CAGR of 34%. Based on that outlook, its stock still looks reasonably valued at 29 times next year's bookings.\n\n3. PagerDuty\n\nLastly, Wood bought 815,239 shares of cloud-based software company PagerDuty, which are now worth nearly $18 million, for the Ark Innovation ETF in June and early July. The fund now owns a $184 million stake in the company, which ranks 11th among its investments and accounts for 3% of its portfolio.\n\nPagerDuty's cloud-based platform makes it easier for IT professionals to respond to infrastructure problems by streamlining their on-call schedules, escalation policies, and alert mechanisms with its digital workflow tools.\n\nFrom fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023, which ended in January 2023, its revenue rose at a CAGR of 30% as its total number of paying customers grew 20%. But in fiscal 2024, its revenue grew only 16% as its total number of paying customers dipped 1%. It blamed that slowdown on the macro headwinds that drove companies to rein in their cloud spending, but it also faces tough competition from similar platforms like Cisco's Splunk and the digital workflow leader ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW).\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect PagerDuty's revenue to increase at a CAGR of only 12%. However, they expect its adjusted EBITDA to grow at a CAGR of 20% as it streamlines its spending. Based on those estimates, PagerDuty's stock seems cheap at 15 times next year's adjusted EBITDA -- but it would arguably be smarter to stick with larger and faster-growing leaders like ServiceNow instead of this underdog.\n\nShould you buy any of these stocks?\n\nI'm not a fan of Cathie Wood's investing style, and I wouldn't rush to buy these three stocks. But if I had to choose one, I'd pick Roblox because it's growing faster, it dominates its growing niche, and its stock still looks reasonably valued. The other two face too many macro and competitive challenges to be considered worthwhile investments.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roku, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Roku wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "body": "The cryptocurrency market is notably volatile. That can lead to some staggering drops in value, but it can also produce some amazing returns in a short amount of time.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) soared to a new all-time high earlier this year amid fervor of new spot Bitcoin ETFs coming to the market. The biggest cryptocurrency in the market saw its value increase 177% from its October lows to its $73,750 high in March. It's since pulled back to around $60,000 per Bitcoin, as of this writing.\n\nA pair of Wall Street analysts think Bitcoin could be set for another surge in its price over the next six months, reaching $150,000 by the end of 2024, a 150% increase. Fundstrat's Tom Lee and Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick each expect the cryptocurrency to zoom past its all-time highs later this year.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe most recent challenge for Bitcoin is nearly behind it\n\nBitcoin's price is primarily determined by supply and demand. Earlier this year, the Bitcoin halving reduced the rate of the cryptocurrency's supply increase. Previous halvings have been bullish for Bitcoin, as demand growth outpaces supply growth. However, another big influx of supply remains a challenge for Bitcoin's price.\n\nJust a few days after the most recent Bitcoin halving, the defunct Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2014, provided good news for creditors. Mt. Gox was once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, but suffered a devastating hack in 2014, resulting in the loss of over 850,000 Bitcoin. In April, the Mt. Gox trustee said it will start returning some of the lost funds by October.\n\nIn late June, the trustee announced plans to begin disbursements in July. Two years ago, the Mt. Gox trustee held 142,000 Bitcoin, which is worth over $8.5 billion at today's price. If the creditors receiving their Bitcoin choose to sell, it could put a huge amount of downward pressure on Bitcoin's price. That potential selling pressure has been baked into the price of Bitcoin over the last few months.\n\nBut demand for Bitcoin is mostly based on future expectations. And the Mt. Gox settlement is nearly put to bed. Lee says that's a reason to invest in Bitcoin now. \"That was a huge overhang for many years,\" he said in an interview with CNBC. \"But if I was investing in crypto, knowing that one of the biggest overhangs is going to disappear in July, I think it's a reason to actually expect a pretty sharp rebound in the second half.\" He says $150,000 per Bitcoin is still possible by the end of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nKendrick believes macro events like the U.S. election could have a significant role in the price of Bitcoin later this year. He sees a scenario where the cryptocurrency reaches $100,000 by election day and $150,000 by year-end.\n\nThis major source of demand will drive Bitcoin higher\n\nThe biggest potential driver of Bitcoin's long-term price appreciation is the growing adoption of the asset within institutional portfolios.\n\nThe new spot Bitcoin ETFs approved in January will usher in a new and easier way for institutional investors to invest in the cryptocurrency. Many hedge fund managers pounced on the opportunity. They had $4.2 billion invested in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: GBTC) and another $3.2 billion in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT), as of the end of the first quarter, according to SEC filings.\n\nInflows into the Bitcoin ETFs have died down in the second quarter, but the potential for broader adoption among institutional investors remains. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest expects Bitcoin to play a major role in institutional investor portfolios in the future. The analysts figure a 1% allocation of investable assets in Bitcoin will push the price of the cryptocurrency to $120,000, but they see potential for a much higher allocation.\n\nAs more institutions drive demand higher and supply growth continues to slow, there's plenty of room for the Bitcoin price to move higher. Whether it reaches $150,000 by the end of the year, it's hard to say. But the cryptocurrency does have a history of making large moves in a short amount of time. If you're bullish on Bitcoin, the best time to invest is now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Bitcoin wasn\u2019t one of them.

And due to lower capital expenditures, it now believes adjusted free cash flow will be higher than previously forecast.\n\nBesides Ford being on what appears to be healthy footing, income-seeking investors will certainly appreciate the company's hefty dividend yield of 4.7%. That's a nice boost for potential returns.\n\nThe bad\n\nTesla's monumental rise over the past decade to become a $772 billion company has rattled the auto sector. Elon Musk's business is the world's leading seller of electric vehicles (EVs). This success kicked off a big strategic shift among legacy carmakers to develop their own EVs.\n\nFord is one of the players in this game with popular models like the F-150 Lightning pickup and Mustang Mach-E SUV. In 2023, the company generated $5.9 billion in revenue from what it calls its model e segment, where its EV operations are housed. That figure was up 12% year over year.\n\nBut the problem is that this division is far from profitable. It reported an operating loss of $1.3 billion in the first quarter, after losing $4.7 billion in all of 2023. It's anyone's guess when it will produce earnings.\n\nTo make matters worse, management has decided to delay $12 billion in EV-related investments because demand isn't as strong as hoped. Ford needs to figure out a clear path to profitable growth with its EVs, otherwise this segment will continue to be a huge drag on its financials.\n\nThe ugly\n\nI don't believe Ford is a worthy investment for many reasons. For starters, the industry is extremely cyclical. The company is sure to be hit hard in a recession, when consumer confidence is low and unemployment is high, and people hold off on buying new vehicles. It's impossible to predict when the economic cycle will turn in order to buy and sell Ford shares at the right time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe business operates in a mature industry. According to the International Energy Agency, the number of passenger vehicles sold globally in 2022, 74.8 million, was just 12% higher than in 2010.\n\nEven if EVs really do take off, I don't see Ford's sales volume changing when compared to the past. Add in the fact that competition is fierce, and the automaker doesn't have any sort of economic moat.\n\nThere is also cause for concern from a financial perspective. In the past decade, its operating margin has averaged a disappointing 1.9%. And the company's operations are extremely capital intensive; it must always spend big on research and development, manufacturing, labor, and marketing to maintain its industry position, let alone strengthen it. The negatives are too difficult to ignore, so I'm not buying Ford stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ford Motor Company wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "body": "Just when investors thought shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) might have run out of momentum, the company's developer conference, where it unveiled an avalanche of upcoming products and features using artificial intelligence (AI), supercharged the stock and sent it to new highs.\n\nApple is arguably one of the most obvious AI stocks because generative AI perfectly fits the core experience of using iOS products. The million-dollar question is just how much upside remains in the stock for prospective investors today. Is Apple a buy? Here is what you need to know.\n\nAI is a genuine game changer for Apple\n\nIt's fair to say that AI is a big deal for Apple. The company recently unveiled numerous AI features it will build into its software. Some examples include custom emojis, integrating ChatGPT into Siri, and its in-house AI tech, Apple Intelligence. The influx of new technology could dramatically improve the user experience on iOS devices, which Apple was already known for.\n\nAfter years of limited functionality, I cannot wait for a better version of Siri. It doesn't seem like a stretch that others feel the same. A better experience with iOS devices likely means an even stickier Apple ecosystem. In other words, AI seems likely to enhance Apple's core business of selling iOS devices and services rather than harm it.\n\nBut can AI solve Apple's growth woes?\n\nAI's impact on Apple will determine whether it can get sales growth moving in the right direction again. As you can see below, Apple's revenue has peaked and begun declining in recent years. New iterations of the iPhone are released annually, and the year-to-year changes aren't as pronounced as a decade ago. The product has matured. Incremental camera, screen, and processor updates only go so far.\n\nCombine that with Apple's famously good build quality, and users no longer rush to upgrade their phones. An estimated 61% of iPhone owners wait at least two years to upgrade.\n\nAAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nGetting more iPhone users to upgrade could revive revenue growth, and AI could be the catalyst. It's not a bold statement to say that AI features are the most significant iPhone breakthrough since the first 5G phone, which sparked Apple's last growth spurt. Naturally, only Apple's newest phones, the iPhone 15 generation, will be compatible with AI. Time will tell if consumers are excited enough to splurge on new devices.\n\nIs Apple a buy?\n\nIf the share price is any indication, Wall Street is confident AI will help Apple grow again. Shares have rocketed to all-time highs since Apple unveiled its AI plans. But here's the problem: The stock now trades at a forward P/E over 33, its highest valuation in recent memory.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors can equate a stock's valuation to expectations. The stock's average P/E for the past decade is just 21. Such a departure from long-term norms is Wall Street saying loud and clear, \"You better deliver the goods!\"\n\nAAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAI sounds promising, but this is a lot to ask. Even analysts estimate just 10% annual earnings growth over the long term, which doesn't seem near enough to justify Apple's current price. Maybe Apple delivers and then some. It could justify the share price, but what about additional gains for investors who buy today? Or worse, what if AI doesn't impact Apple's business the way people hope and shares head to a lower valuation?\n\nThe reality is that AI hype has priced Apple stock for perfection. There is far more room for shares to go down than up, and even a best-case scenario doesn't seem to offer much to get excited about. Apple customers have a lot to look forward to with AI, but investors are best off staying away until the share price makes a lot more sense than it does now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Wall Street\u2019s Big Bond Bet Revives Before Pivotal Inflation Data",
    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The bond trade that some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks say will dominate the rest of 2024 is gaining steam before a crucial inflation reading that will help seal the wager\u2019s fate.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe bet \u2014 that the US yield curve will normalize toward a steeper slope \u2014 is suddenly looking as good as it has in months.\n\nIt got an initial boost after President Joe Biden\u2019s June 27 debate performance appeared to ease Donald Trump\u2019s path to retake the White House. In its aftermath, strategists at banks including Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley have touted the so-called Trump trade. The idea is that the Republican\u2019s policies on tariffs, immigration and deficits will lead investors to demand higher yields on longer-maturity Treasuries.\n\nThe next leg up in the trade came Friday, when fresh signs of a softening job market bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, spurring a sharp drop in short-dated yields. One closely watched measure of the yield curve \u2014 the gap between 5- and 30-year yields \u2014 reached the widest since February after the data.\n\nEasing by the central bank is seen as the steepener bet\u2019s principal driver, which heightens the focus on inflation readings ahead this week. Consumer prices likely rose at the slowest annual pace since January, a Bloomberg survey shows. Evidence of further disinflation may remove a major obstacle to the steepener\u2019s success: Fed officials have been signaling that they\u2019re not ready to lower rates.\n\n\u201cThe steepening because of inflation, because of fiscal policy, can continue,\u201d said Cindy Beaulieu, chief investment officer for North America at Conning.\n\nThe trade was a market favorite around the turn of the year as well, as investors entered 2024 betting on a series of Fed rate cuts. Instead, a resilient economy and sticky inflation derailed wagers on easing. When the US bond market closed on June 27 hours before the debate, the difference between 5- and 30-year yields was about 5 basis points narrower relative to the end of the year. The trade, in other words, was a loser.\n\nWhile political developments initiated its revival, a more sustainable move requires the Fed to cut aggressively. That would push short-term yields down more than those on longer tenors, producing what traders call a bull-steepening move.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Strategists Say...\n\nThough steepening of the Treasury yield curve may continue in the short term, we think recent bear steepening may soon conclude in favor of bull steepening once the Fed begins its rate-cut cycle... Though there are periods when the yield curve bull or bear flattens, the large moves in the curve are related to how the front end moves, suggesting Federal Reserve policy is key to the direction of the yield curve.\n\n\u2014Ira Jersey and Christopher Cain. Read more here.\n\nBut there are few signs that the economy is fading to a degree that would trigger an imminent rescue from the Fed. Nor do policymakers seem to be confident enough that inflation is cooling sufficiently.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at recent jobs and inflation data, we do not see the case for a lot of cuts this cycle,\u201d said Baylor Lancaster-Samuel, chief investment officer at Amerant Investments Inc. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a risk that this Fed will continue to hold rates at a restrictive level well into 2025. So the risk is that we don\u2019t get that aggressive bull steepening anytime soon.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists are also skeptical toward the steepener. They expect the 5- to 30-year gap to be basically unchanged in the fourth quarter from current levels.\n\nStrategist Bill Zu points out that when Trump initiated the trade war with China during his presidency, yields declined and the curve flattened as tariffs weighed on productivity and growth. In addition, the relatively small difference in the outlook for US deficits under the two candidates\u2019 policies suggests that any supply-driven yield repricing based on the election should be \u201cmodest at best,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, strategists at TD Securities anticipate that the spread between 5- and 30-year yields will eventually quadruple from now, to 100 basis points. Fed cuts are integral to that call, which the bank has held since last year. But so is the threat of high deficits no matter which party prevails in November, TD\u2019s Gennadiy Goldberg and his team wrote late last month.\n\nGreg Wilensky, head of US fixed income at Janus Henderson Investors, said he\u2019s \u201cmoderately\u201d positioned for a steeper curve by being overweight the five-year part of the curve and underweight longer maturities. The state of the economy will be the main trigger for the strategy, rather than politics, he said.\n\n\u201cThe data that we\u2019re going to see is going to, hopefully, increase the probability that a soft landing can be achieved, and the Fed can start cutting rates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019ll be good for steepeners.\u201d\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nEconomic data: July 8: New York Fed 1-year inflation expectations; consumer credit July 9: NFIB small business optimism July 10: MBA mortgage applications; wholesale inventories July 11: Consumer price index; real average earnings; weekly jobless claims; monthly budget statement July 12: Producer price index; University of Michigan sentiment\n\nFed calendar: July 9: Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr; Chair Jerome Powell testifies to Senate Banking and Housing Committee; Governor Michelle Bowman July 10: Powell testifies to House Financial Services Committee; Chicago Fed\u2019s Austan Goolsbee and Bowman; Governor Lisa Cook July 11: Atlanta Fed\u2019s Raphael Bostic; St. Louis Fed\u2019s Alberto Musalem\n\nAuction calendar: July 8: 13- and 26-week bills July 9: 42\u2014day CMB; 52-week bills; 3-year notes July 10: 17-week bills; 10-year notes reopening July 11: 4- and 8-week bills; 30-year bonds reopening\n\n\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "body": "By Jamie McGeever\n\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\n\nInvestors start the new week in ebullient mood after last Friday's U.S. jobs figures kept the \"soft landing\" story on track, lowering the dollar and bond yields, and adding fuel to the relentless \"risk on\" rally in stocks.\n\nMost of the world's main equity markets are at record or multi-year peaks, and there doesn't seem to be much on the immediate horizon to derail them.\n\nProfit-taking, quarter-end position adjustments, worries over valuations or market concentration, and political or policy jitters have all come into play recently. But the overpowering \"buy the dip\" mentality has ensured any pull backs have been shallow and brief.\n\nEuropean politics may have some influence on early Asian trading on Monday - France was on course for a hung parliament in Sunday's election, with a leftist alliance unexpectedly taking top spot ahead of the far right in a major upset that was set to bar the far right, eurosceptic National Rally party from running the government.\n\nAsia opens in good shape. Japan's Nikkei 225 index scraped a new record high of 41,100 points on Friday and has risen some 7% in just two weeks, and the MSCI Emerging Market and MSCI Asia ex-Japan indices are at their highest in two years.\n\nMore broadly, the MSCI World, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all hit record highs last week, and last month euro zone stocks hit a 23-year high. Britain's FTSE 100 hit a record high in May.\n\nMonday's Asia and Pacific calendar is light, with the spotlight on bank lending, trade and current account, and overtime pay figures from Japan. Philippines central bank governor Eli Remolona and finance secretary Ralph Recto speak at a business forum on Monday too.\n\nJapan's overtime pay isn't usually seen as a top-tier indicator, but it is worth watching this month.\n\nA recent labor union survey showed that firms offered to hike pay by 5.1% on average this year, the biggest increase in 33 years and far outpacing inflation now hovering around 2%. But figures on Friday showed that household spending plunged in May as higher prices continued to squeeze consumers' purchasing power.\n\nThis is a headache for Bank of Japan policymakers who want to raise interest rates and have put great store on rising wages, but are worried about the impact on an economy that's far from firing on all cylinders.\n\nLooking ahead, the most market-sensitive events in Asia this week are likely to be central bank policy meetings in New Zealand, South Korea and Malaysia, and producer and consumer price inflation figures from China.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main market drivers globally are likely to be U.S. CPI inflation on Thursday, and two days of Congressional testimony by Fed Chair Jerome Powell set for Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Monday:\n\n- Japan wage growth (May)\n\n- Japan current account (May)\n\n- France general election\n\n(Reporting by Jamie McGeever)",

    "title": "The big problem with couples retiring at different times? Overspending.",
    "body": "My husband exited his full-time job in April, and I am freaking out about how much we are spending as he embarks on his travel adventures and we have some major home repairs up ahead.\n\nNo, I'm not crazy, nor alone. The problem is the amount we spend each year is far from stable and predictable for the majority of retirees, according to a recent report.\n\nAnd that means trouble if you're planning for a smooth-sailing retirement.\n\n\u201cA majority of retirees experience significant changes in their spending patterns over time; about half experience ongoing volatility, or an annual change of 20% or more \u2014 either higher or lower,\u201d Sharon Carson, a retirement strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management and the author of the report, told me.\n\nThe big trouble, however, is with couples retiring at different times \u2014 and how it impacts long-term financial security.\n\nMore than half of American households do not retire all at once if you count individuals working in retirement and spouses retiring at different times. Count me in this cohort.\n\nThe result is that 6 in 10 couples \u201cexperience spending volatility at the beginning of retirement and experience both major ups and downs from year to year,\u201d Carson said.\n\nWhat's the deal?\n\nThe concern is that spending surges at the beginning of retirement can seriously ding a retirement plan, since early and unexpected withdrawals can damage overall long-term returns. One of our deepest fears about retirement is outliving our money. So figuring out just how much to pull from retirement accounts for living expenses each year is unsettling. Take too much and the future could be bleak.\n\nRead more: How much money should I have saved by 50?\n\nRetirees who take steps to increase their non-retirement portfolio income through strategies like pushing back receiving Social Security checks to full retirement age, ideally age 70, or working longer are in the best shape to weather variable spending and withdrawals. But few are doing that, More than 4 in 10 Americans turn on their Social Security benefit as soon as they are eligible at age 62.\n\nIn reality, few couples retire at the same time. Among those currently retired, only 11% left the workforce at the same time, according to a report by Ameriprise.\n\nThe good old 4% rule\n\nWe\u2019re pushed incessantly to save as much as we can during our working years. When we retire this shifts from saving to spending, and panic sets in.\n\nHow much someone can spend each year from their retirement accounts is unique to their circumstances. The 4% withdrawal rate is a percentage that has been the standard for years and still is used as a flagpole, the financial advisers I reached out to this week said. In other words, if you have, say, $1 million saved, you'd take out $40,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut what if your spending surges as it does for many partially retired couples? Oh man, that can be a mess.\n\nThe JPMorgan study analyzed spending patterns from more than 280,000 Chase customers. \u201cThese findings are important since an individual\u2019s financial life may be intertwined with a partner\u2019s,\u201d Carson said.\n\nRead more: Retirement planning: A step-by-step guide\n\nShe\u2019s right about that. The traditional spending in retirement model has changed drastically in the last two decades as dual-income couples have become the majority of American households. (Fifty years ago, husbands were the breadwinner in 85% of marriages, according to data from the Pew Research Center.)\n\n\"Spending in retirement varies from year to year and is far from stable and predictable for the majority of retirees,\" Carson said. \"When you add in spouses retiring at different times, that's very significant.\"\n\nDual-earning couples, she added, \"have put a new wrinkle on things, and some of the planning tools and conversations haven't quite caught up with that yet.\u201d\n\nThe expectation is that our spending-like-the-world\u2019s-on-fire phase post-working will taper off as we adjust to paying ourselves from our savings. But when couples play out their financial plan together, it\u2019s not as straightforward as you might imagine.\n\nSure, we imagine that we ratchet up our spending a bit the first year or so for travel and reward ourselves for our years of hard work, but then we tap the brakes. That\u2019s how most financial planners have typically approached the blueprint for couples budgeting retirement spending \u2014 a smooth drop in spending to a steady-eddy level.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what is happening. \u201cWe thought, oh, we're probably going to see a lot of people downshift their spending after retirement,\u201d Carson said. \u201cAnd we did downshifting, then we saw upshifting, and then we saw downshifting.\"\n\nBeware those spending splurges in retirement. (Image: Getty Creative) (Alan Schein Photography via Getty Images)\n\nThese partially retired couples are also spending more to pay down their credit card revolving debt, per the report. \u201cSo they're getting on better financial footing, which is the good news,\u201d Carson said.\n\nHurray.\n\nHere's how couples who don't retire at the same time can manage retirement spending surges:\n\nHave an honest talk about spending before one of you retires.\n\n\u201cOften retirement means some income goes away, and the spending goes up because now you have time to do the things that you've been postponing or dreaming of all this time \u2014 that\u2019s one of the most fraught parts of the conversation that I have with clients,\u201d Stephanie McCullough, founder and chief executive of Sofia Financial, told me.\n\nSpending conversations with soon-to-be-retired couples are often fraught, said Stephanie McCullough, founder and chief executive of Sofia Financial (middle). (Photo courtesy of Stephanie McCullough) (Stephanie McCullough)\n\nOf course, matters of spending and overall money concerns vary widely between us. \u201cSituations are all so different, it's hard to generalize,\u201d Christine Benz, Morningstar\u2019s director of personal finance and retirement planning, said. \u201cThe still-working person's salary may or may not cover all of the household's living expenses. If it doesn't and the couple needs to pull some money from the portfolio to meet their living expenses, it's actually a great trial run because people often struggle with spending from their portfolios. This is retirement spending with training wheels.\u201d\n\nGet comfortable with spending.\n\nSpending in retirement should be, well, fun. It\u2019s not always so. \u201cOne thing that has surprised me in conversation with people is that those who are either retired or on the verge of retiring feel extremely uncomfortable enjoying their money or spending it at all,\u201d said Aja Evans, a financial therapist in New York.\n\n\u201cLearning to spend comfortably and responsibly is just as important as saving and investing for your future. There is a lot of guilt that can come up when it comes time to live off your retirement and not seeing money come in at the same time.\u201d\n\nOne way to take control is to hash it out as openly as you can. \u201cA lot of fear, anxiety, stress, worry, and anger can come up if left unaddressed,\u201d Evans said.\n\nAs for my situation? We've got a meeting next week with our financial adviser. I feel my nerves racing already.\n\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

    "body": "By Elizabeth Pineau\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - The champagne was on ice at the far-right National Rally's (RN) headquarters, but the celebratory mood swiftly turned to disbelief when the first projected results from Sunday's parliamentary election appeared on TV screens.\n\nFor days, Marine Le Pen had confidently predicted that her party would triumph with an outright majority and her protege Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Instead, the National Rally was on course to come third, behind a left-wing alliance and President Emmanuel Macron's centrist bloc.\n\nIt was undone to a large extent by tactical dealmaking between centrist and leftist opponents, who pulled more than 200 candidates from three-way races to avoid splitting the anti-RN vote.\n\nThe projected result brought to a shuddering halt what had appeared to be the far right's relentless rise in France, carefully engineered by Le Pen who had sough to clean up her party's image and tap the grievances of voters angry over living costs, strained public services, and immigration.\n\nTo be sure, Le Pen and her party have suffered disappointment before, most recently her 2022 defeat to Macron in the presidential election, and have managed to bounce back more strongly than before.\n\nBut for now, the outcome was a bitter pill to swallow.\n\n\"The results are disappointing and they don't represent what French people want,\" said Jocelyn Cousin, 18, who had come to party HQ expecting a victory party.\n\nThe RN's momentum had appeared unstoppable after it trounced the centrists in European elections in early June and came first, ahead of the hastily assembled leftist New Popular Front, in the first round of the parliamentary vote on June 30.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella attributed their party's setback on Sunday to the what Bardella called the \"disgraceful alliance\" the anti-RN forces, who he said had caricatured the party and disrespected its voters.\n\nBut IPSOS pollster Brice Teinturier pointed to the RN's own shortcomings, including revelations before the run-off that several of its candidates had expressed xenophobic views, raising questions over whether the party had really ditched its more toxic past.\n\n\"What happened is also that RN candidates themselves showed in this campaign that they either were not ready or had in their ranks candidates that are antisemitic, xenophobic or homophobic,\" Teinturier told France 2 television.\n\n'TIDE IS RISING'\n\nFlorent de Kersauson, an RN candidate in Brittany in western France, acknowledged the fallout had been damaging. But he also said voters may have felt the party was arrogant in predicting an absolute majority.\n\n\"I thought it was strange that they said that,\" said Kersauson, who lost his race against a pro-Macron candidate. \"It seemed like something that was very hard to achieve.\"\n\nBardella and Le Pen strove to put a brave face on their result. The party had increased its share of seats in the National Assembly to a record high, they noted, vowing to keep fighting until they won power.\n\n\"The tide is rising, but it didn't rise quite high enough this time,\" said Le Pen, who is likely to mount her fourth presidential campaign in 2027. \"Our victory has merely been delayed.\"\n\nThat was also the feeling among many of the supporters gathered at party HQ in Paris.\n\n\"I see our victory coming.

I have a lot of hope and I'll continue to fight,\" said Elea da Cunha, 17.\n\nFrederic-Pierre Vos, a close associate of Le Pen and former RN party lawyer elected in a constituency north of Paris, said the hung parliament thrown up by the election would mean an ungovernable France, providing fresh opportunities for RN in 2027.\n\nYet despite the party's fighting talk, Sunday's outcome was a clear setback.\n\nBusiness newspaper Les Echos ran a front page showing a grim-faced Bardella with the headline \"la claque\" or \"the slap\".",
    "summary": "For days, Marine Le Pen had confidently predicted that her party would triumph with an outright majority and her protege Jordan Bardella would be prime minister.\nInstead, the National Rally was on course to come third, behind a left-wing alliance and President Emmanuel Macron's centrist bloc.\n\"The results are disappointing and they don't represent what French people want,\" said Jocelyn Cousin, 18, who had come to party HQ expecting a victory party.\nBardella and Le Pen strove to put a brave face on their result.\n\"The tide is rising, but it didn't rise quite high enough this time,\" said Le Pen, who is likely to mount her fourth presidential campaign in 2027.",

    "body": "By Tyler Clifford\n\n(Reuters) -Tropical Storm Beryl could grow into a Category 2 hurricane by the time it makes landfall in the Houston area early on Monday as it regains strength moving northwest over the Gulf of Mexico, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm was expected to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday as it travels over warm waters. The NHC issued hurricane warnings across much of the Texas coast.\n\nForecasters warned that Beryl could bring punishing winds and 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain to the Texas coast and beyond.\n\nCoastal areas were already seeing waters rise on Sunday and county officials ordered one beach town evacuated. The U.S. Coast Guard shut the port of Houston on Sunday afternoon due to worsening sea conditions. It also closed the ports of Texas City, Freeport and Galveston in Texas.\n\nSchool systems including Houston's - the state's largest - said they would be closed Monday.\n\nNational Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan warned on Sunday afternoon that residents had only a few more hours to prepare. \"If you have been asked to leave by local officials, please do so,\" he said.\n\nActing Texas Governor Dan Patrick said Beryl \"will be a deadly storm for people who are directly in that path.\" He declared 120 counties to be in a disaster area.\n\nThe storm has prompted closures or vessel traffic restrictions at multiple ports in cities from Houston to Corpus Christi, which is the top export hub in the U.S. The closures could disrupt crude oil exports, shipments of crude to refineries, and motor fuel from these plants.\n\nTemperatures in the region are forecast at above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) in the coming days, including heat indices as high as 108 on Sunday. Parts of eastern Texas were on flood watch ahead of the storm, which had maximum wind speeds of 60 mph (96 kph) as of Sunday morning.\n\nEarlier this week the storm, which at one point intensified into the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, left a deadly trail of destruction across the Caribbean. It swept through Jamaica, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, in addition to unleashing heavy rainfall on northern Venezuela.\n\nIt has claimed at least 11 lives, tearing apart buildings while felling power lines and trees.\n\nBeryl last made landfall on Friday, crossing Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and causing power outages in some areas. It largely spared the top beach destinations there and caused no casualties. Video showed the international airport at Cancun packed with tourists on Saturday as they rescheduled flights home after the storm.\n\nWith Beryl now approaching Texas, the National Weather Service warned of storm surges causing coastal flooding and rip currents.\n\nOIL REFINERIES\n\nMost of the northern Gulf's offshore oil and gas production is east of Beryl's forecast track.\n\nSome oil producers, including Shell (LON: ) and Chevron (NYSE: ), had evacuated personnel from their Gulf of Mexico offshore production platforms ahead of the storm.\n\nCitgo Petroleum Corp said it plans to keep the Corpus Christi refinery running at minimum production as the storm moves up the coast.\n\nGibson Energy (TSX: ), which operates a large oil terminal in Corpus Christi, said operations were continuing, but it would take further steps depending on the forecast.",

He instead decided to attend the rally of his right-wing ally Bolsonaro.\n\nMilei strained relations with the Brazilian government by calling Lula \"corrupt\" and a \"communist\" in a post on X last week - the most recent in a number of insults. Lula has in the past demanded an apology from Milei.\n\nAfter the speech, the crowd cheered Bolsonaro, saying they want him back in power, despite his being banned from seeking elected office until 2030 for attacks on democracy, and under investigation for other alleged crimes during his four-year term.\n\nCPAC Brasil is intended to drum up support for candidates of Bolsonaro's party in this year's municipal elections and project his influence ahead of the 2026 presidential race.\n\nThe event, billed as the first major opposition rally in the campaign for local mayoral elections in October, also has served to unite right-wing leaders in the Americas.\n\nChile's former presidential candidate Jose Antonio Kast addressed the rally, as did former Bolivian minister Branko Marinkovic, who was presented as a possible candidate for next year's presidential elections in Bolivia.\n\nRight-wing politicians from Portugal and El Salvador also spoke during the event.\n\nBolsonaro, who spoke on Saturday, said the right-wing is gaining ground internationally, in Italy and France, and said he hoped that former U.S. President Donald Trump will be returned to the White House this year.",

    "body": "By Jamie McGeever\n\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\n\nInvestors start the new week in ebullient mood after last Friday's U.S. jobs figures kept the \"soft landing\" story on track, lowering the dollar and bond yields, and adding fuel to the relentless \"risk on\" rally in stocks.\n\nMost of the world's main equity markets are at record or multi-year peaks, and there doesn't seem to be much on the immediate horizon to derail them.\n\nProfit-taking, quarter-end position adjustments, worries over valuations or market concentration, and political or policy jitters have all come into play recently. But the overpowering \"buy the dip\" mentality has ensured any pull backs have been shallow and brief.\n\nEuropean politics may have some influence on early Asian trading on Monday - France was on course for a hung parliament in Sunday's election, with a leftist alliance unexpectedly taking top spot ahead of the far right in a major upset that was set to bar the far right, eurosceptic National Rally party from running the government.\n\nAsia opens in good shape. Japan's scraped a new record high of 41,100 points on Friday and has risen some 7% in just two weeks, and the MSCI Emerging Market and indices are at their highest in two years.\n\nMore broadly, the MSCI World, , and Nasdaq all hit record highs last week, and last month euro zone stocks hit a 23-year high. 100 hit a record high in May.\n\nMonday's Asia and Pacific calendar is light, with the spotlight on bank lending, trade and current account, and overtime pay figures from Japan. Philippines central bank governor Eli Remolona and finance secretary Ralph Recto speak at a business forum on Monday too.\n\nJapan's overtime pay isn't usually seen as a top-tier indicator, but it is worth watching this month.\n\nA recent labor union survey showed that firms offered to hike pay by 5.1% on average this year, the biggest increase in 33 years and far outpacing inflation now hovering around 2%. But figures on Friday showed that household spending plunged in May as higher prices continued to squeeze consumers' purchasing power.\n\nThis is a headache for Bank of Japan policymakers who want to raise interest rates and have put great store on rising wages, but are worried about the impact on an economy that's far from firing on all cylinders.\n\nLooking ahead, the most market-sensitive events in Asia this week are likely to be central bank policy meetings in New Zealand, South Korea and Malaysia, and producer and consumer price inflation figures from China.\n\nThe main market drivers globally are likely to be U.S. CPI inflation on Thursday, and two days of Congressional testimony by Fed Chair Jerome Powell set for Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Monday:\n\n- Japan wage growth (May)\n\n- Japan current account (May)\n\n- France general election",

    "body": "By Arathy Somasekhar, Marianna Parraga\n\nHOUSTON (Reuters) -Ports along the Texas coast were closing or restricting vessel traffic on Sunday to prepare for Tropical Storm Beryl, which was expected to strengthen back to a hurricane before hitting the area early on Monday.\n\nThe storm, which at one point intensified to a Category 5 hurricane, left a deadly trail of destruction across the Caribbean. It could grow into a Category 2 hurricane when it makes landfall in the middle of the Texas coast between Galveston and Corpus Christi, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe port of Corpus Christi said it was closed after condition \"Zulu\" was set by the Coast Guard captain on Sunday. All vessel movement and cargo operations are restricted as gale force winds are expected within 12 hours.\n\nCorpus Christi, about 200 miles (322 km) from Houston, is the top export hub in the United States. Port closures could bring a temporary halt to crude exports, oil shipments to refineries, and motor fuels from those plants.\n\nThe port of Houston's eight public facilities were set to close operations on Monday, a spokesperson said. The 52-mile Houston ship channel, which on Sunday was operating under transit restrictions, also allows access to some 200 private terminals.\n\nMeanwhile the ports of Freeport and Texas City were under condition \"Yankee\", with all inbound vessel traffic suspended at these ports as gale force winds were predicted within 24 hours.\n\nU.S. liquefied (LNG) producer Cheniere Energy (NYSE: ) said on Sunday its Corpus Christi facility was operating without interruptions, but all nonessential personnel were released from work.\n\n\"Our Gulf Coast assets, including Corpus Christi, have robust and proven severe-weather preparedness,\" it said in a release.\n\nFreeport LNG said it had implemented its weather emergency response plan, thought it did not give details. It said it intends to maintain normal operations at its liquefaction facility.\n\nActing Texas Governor Dan Patrick urged people who were on vacation in coastal areas to leave before the storm made landfall and announced that 81 counties were added to the state's disaster declaration list to make a total of 120.\n\n\"It's a serious storm and you must take it seriously and be prepared,\" he said in a meeting with officials in Austin.\n\nPREPARED\n\nChemical maker Chemours Co , which has a production facility near Corpus Christi, said on Sunday it had integrated hurricane preparedness plans to ensure its sites remained safe.\n\n\"We have escalated our hurricane preparedness plans to include planning for safe and adequate staffing during and after the storm and securing our equipment and assets, should the storm make landfall near our site,\" the company said in an e-mailed statement.\n\nEnbridge (NYSE: ) Inc, which operates large crude oil export facilities near Corpus Christi, said all assets were operating, adding that they had activated emergency plans for its U.S. Gulf assets.\n\nGibson Energy (TSX: ), which also operates an export facility in the area, said on Sunday all Gateway and Houston based employees were safe, and facilities and docks were secured after the port of Corpus Christi closure. The company initiated storm preparedness response protocols.\n\nCitgo Petroleum Corp was cutting production at its 165,000 barrel-per-day Corpus Christi, Texas, refinery on Saturday, sources said. The refiner plans to keep the plant in operation at minimum during Beryl's passage.\n\nSome oil producers, including Shell (LON: ) and Chevron (NYSE: ), had also shut in production or evacuated personnel from their Gulf of Mexico offshore platforms.",

    "title": "Euro falls as markets brace for French post-election gridlock By Reuters",
    "body": "By Harry Robertson and Dhara Ranasinghe\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -The euro slipped on Sunday after projections from France's election pointed to a hung parliament and an unexpectedly strong showing for the left-wing New Popular Front, casting fresh uncertainty over markets and setting the stage for further volatility ahead.\n\nAnalysts said markets would likely be relieved that Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) was forecast to come third after last week's first-round victory.\n\nYet investors also have concerns that the French left\u2019s plans could unwind many of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pro-market reforms. And they believe political gridlock could end attempts to rein in France's debt, which stood at 110.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023.\n\nThe euro fell 0.2% to $1.081 as the week\u2019s trading got underway. It had climbed last week as opinion polls suggested a hung parliament was likely, assuaging fears of a far right victory, after dropping sharply - along with stocks and bonds - when Macron called the elections in early June.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the anti-far right parties really got a lot of support,\u201d said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe.\n\n\u201cBut fundamentally from a market perspective, there\u2019s no difference in terms of the outcome. There\u2019s really going to be a vacuum when it comes to France\u2019s legislative ability.\"\n\nHarvey added: \"The bond market is going to be the real place to look at. There might be a bit of a gap lower in French bonds (prices).\"\n\nTrading in French bonds and stocks will begin on Monday morning in Europe.\n\nThe leftist alliance, which gathers the hard left, the Socialists and Greens, was forecast to win between 172 and 215 seats out of 577, according to pollsters' projections based on early results from a sample of polling stations.\n\nMacron\u2019s centrist alliance was projected to win 150-180 seats, with the RN seen getting 115 to 155 seats.\n\nAnalysts said a period of volatility and uncertainty was expected to continue as investors now assess what form the parliament will take, and how many, if any, of its policies the leftist alliance will be able to implement.\n\nThe New Popular Front alliance says its first moves would include a 10% civil servant pay hike, providing free school lunches, supplies and transport while raising housing subsidies by 10%. \"The economic programme of the left is in many ways much more problematic than that of the right, and while the left will not be able to govern on their own, the outlook for French public finances deteriorates further with these results,\" said Nordea chief market analyst Jan von Gerich.\n\nJITTERY MARKETS\n\nMarkets tumbled after Macron gambled in June by calling a parliamentary election following a trouncing at the hands of the RN in European Parliament elections - as investors worried an RN victory could install a prime minister intent on a high-spending, France-first agenda that would exacerbate a large debt pile and shake relations with Europe.\n\nThe risk premium investors demand to hold the country's debt soared to its highest level since the euro zone crisis in 2012. French stocks, led by banks, dropped as investors worried about their holdings of government debt, new regulation and economic uncertainty in the euro area's second biggest economy.\n\nYet equities, bonds and the euro all recovered somewhat last week as polls showed a hung parliament was the most likely outcome as the left wing and centrist parties struck deals to give anti-RN candidates a better chance.\n\nThe exact make-up of the next parliament remains uncertain, as does the next prime minister. Gabriel Attal said he would hand his resignation to Macron on Monday.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to be very hard to actually go ahead and pass any policy and bring about any progressive reforms because each party\u2019s vote is split and no one has an absolute majority,\u201d said Aneeka Gupta, director of macroeconomic research at WisdomTree.\n\nYet she added: \"I think the markets will be happy we\u2019re avoiding this extreme situation with the far right.\"",

The InvestingPro Summer Sale is live: Subscribe for under $8/month!\n\nU.S. stocks finished higher on Friday to notch another winning week as the and both ended at new records after the latest jobs report boosted hopes of an autumn interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n\nFor the week, the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 2% and 3.5% respectively, while the blue-chip added 0.7%.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nThe week ahead will feature key Congressional testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell as investors look for more clues on the outlook for the economy, inflation, and interest rates.\n\nTraders are currently pricing in a roughly 78% chance the central bank will lower rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting, according to the Investing.com .\n\nMeanwhile, on the economic calendar, most important will be Thursday\u2019s U.S. consumer price inflation report for June, which is forecast to show annual CPI rising 3.1%, slowing from the 3.3% increase recorded in May.\n\nThe CPI data will be accompanied by the release of the latest figures on producer prices, which will help fill out the inflation picture.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nElsewhere, a new earnings season is set to get underway with a slew of big bank earnings reports. Major lenders JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), Wells Fargo (NYSE: ), and Citigroup (NYSE: ) are all due to deliver quarterly results on Friday.\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, July 8 - Friday, July 12.\n\nStock to Buy: Palantir\n\nI expect Palantir (NYSE: ) to continue its upward trend as shares of the application software company look primed for a significant breakout this week due to its bullish technical chart setup.\n\nAs seen below, the stock's technical chart shows a bullish correction that positions PLTR for a big move above $30.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nCurrently trading at $27.23, just below its 2024 peak of $27.50 reached on March 7, PLTR is readying for a breakout from a substantial base that formed from late 2021 into early 2024. This big base remains firmly in place above $22, indicating strong support and an upside potential to pattern counts at $27.50-$29.30 and $30.30-$33.50.\n\nShares are up 58.6% year-to-date amid excitement over the big-data firm\u2019s leading role in artificial intelligence. At current levels, the Denver, Colorado-based software maker has a market cap of $60.6 billion.\n\nPalantir has been at the forefront of AI innovation, leveraging its cutting-edge data analytics platforms, Palantir Foundry and Palantir Gotham. With growing enterprise demand for AI-driven data analytics, Palantir is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.\n\nAdditionally, investors should also note that Palantir is set to report its Q2 earnings in early August. Given the company's recent performance and upbeat growth trajectory, this earnings report could serve as another positive catalyst for the stock.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nAnalysts have become increasingly bullish on the data-mining specialist ahead of the print, according to an InvestingPro survey, which revealed that six out of the eight analysts surveyed boosted their earnings forecast to reflect a gain of roughly 34% from their initial estimates.\n\nPalantir is seen earning $0.08 a share, improving 60% from a profit of $0.05 in the same quarter a year earlier. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to jump 22.4% to $652.5 million, benefiting from strong demand for its data analytics tools and services from both government and commercial clients.\n\nSubscribe now to InvestingPro for 50% OFF and position your portfolio one step ahead of everyone else!\n\nStock to Sell: Delta Air Lines\n\nOn the flip side, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: ) is a stock to avoid this week. Delta is forecast to release its Q2 update before the U.S. market opens on Thursday at 6:30AM ET. Unfortunately, the outlook isn't promising.\n\nThe airline industry is facing significant headwinds amid concerns over weakening demand for air travel. Soft consumer spending, driven by a challenging economic environment, has put pressure on Delta\u2019s revenue and profitability. This trend is likely to be reflected in Delta\u2019s Q2 earnings and guidance, making the stock a risky bet.\n\nAccording to the options market, traders are pricing in a swing of about 6% in either direction for DAL stock following the print.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nWall Street sees the Atlanta, Georgia-based airliner earning $2.37 a share in the June quarter, declining 11.6% from EPS of $2.68 in the year-ago period, due to higher cost pressures and declining operating margins.\n\nDespite seeing 10 of the 15 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro upwardly revise their profit forecast ahead of the report, estimates are still lower than they were previously, reflecting the difficult operating environment.\n\nMeanwhile, the legacy air carrier\u2019s revenue is forecast to inch up 7.7% annually to $15.73 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, it is my belief that Delta CEO Ed Bastian will provide a disappointing outlook for fiscal 2025 and strike a cautious tone amid growing recession fears that have sparked concerns about consumer spending.\n\nDAL stock ended at $46.02 on Friday, its lowest closing price since April 4. Shares are down nearly 15% since climbing to a 2024 peak of $53.86 on May 13.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAt current valuations, Delta has a market cap of $29.7 billion, making it the most valuable U.S. airline company, ahead of industry peers such as Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ), United Airlines, and American Airlines (NASDAQ: ).\n\nIt should be noted that Delta\u2019s short-term outlook for profitability and cash flow appears risky, as per InvestingPro, which flag rising fuel prices, and increasing aircraft maintenance costs as causes for concern.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.\n\nReaders of this article can subscribe to InvestingPro for less than $7 a month as part of our summer sale.\n\nTo apply the discount, don't forget to use the coupon codes PROTIPS2024 (yearly) and PROTIPS20242 (bi-yearly).\n\nWhether you're a novice investor or a seasoned trader, leveraging InvestingPro can unlock a world of investment opportunities while minimizing risks amid the challenging backdrop of elevated inflation, high interest rates, and mounting geopolitical turmoil.\n\nFair Value: Instantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.\n\nInstantly find out if a stock is underpriced or overvalued.

    "title": "Left-wing New Popular Front coalition leads French election, polls show By Reuters",
    "body": "LONDON (Reuters) -France was on track for a hung parliament in Sunday's election, with a leftist alliance unexpectedly taking the top spot ahead of the far right, in a major upset that was set to prevent Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) from running the government.\n\nThe outcome, if confirmed, will leave parliament divided in three big groups with hugely different platforms and no tradition of working together.\n\nThe RN was set to come third, according to pollsters' projections based on early results.\n\nIn early Asia trade, the euro slipped against the dollar and other major currencies. It was last trading down around 0.2% at $1.0802.\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nLEE HARDMAN, SENIOR CURRENCY ANALYST, MUFG, LONDON:\n\n\"It's looking like a hung parliament and the RN hasn't done as well as expected, whereas the left leaning parties have performed.\"\n\n\"Over the last week or so, currency markets have moved to price out a lot of the risk premium anyway. So, I think for now it's going to be a wait and see what happens in terms of the trying to form a government and kind of negotiations that will try to take place in the coming weeks.\"\n\n\"This will ultimately dictate what happens next for the for the euro. Just based on the exit polls, we're not looking for a sharp move lower for the euro.\" He spoke after the initial dip.\n\nANEEKA GUPTA, MACROECONOMIC RESEARCH DIRECTOR, WISDOMTREE, LONDON:\n\n\"We should get a brief respite in the market. I think it should breathe in a fresh rally because we\u2019re not seeing an extremist RN majority take place, but it\u2019s likely to lead to political gridlock at least until the autumn of 2025.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s going to be very hard to actually go ahead and pass any policy and bring about any progressive reforms because each party\u2019s vote is split and no one has an absolute majority. I would say it\u2019s a bit of a tricky situation.\"\n\n\"I think the markets will be happy we\u2019re avoiding this extreme situation with the far right.\"\n\nMARCHEL ALEXANDROVICH, ECONOMIST, SALTMARSH ECONOMICS, LONDON:\n\n\"The result is a surprise, with the Left Wing Alliance doing much better than expected.\"\n\n\"However, fundamentally, it still suggests a period of difficult cohabitation for Macron and it will be a challenge for him to push forward with a strong legislative agenda.\" CORNELIA WOLL, PRESIDENT AND PROFESSOR HERTIE SCHOOL, BERLIN:\n\n\"All in all, Emmanuel Macron's risky bet has not produced a clear parliamentary majority. He now finds himself in the same situation as before, in which his party has no backing to push through ambitious legislative proposals. \u2026 This unstable situation will now be the new normal until summer 2025, as the constitution prohibits the president from dissolving parliament again before a year has passed.\"\n\nSIMON HARVEY, HEAD OF FX ANALYSIS, MONEX EUROPE, LONDON:\n\n\"It looks like the anti-far right parties really got a lot of support. But fundamentally from a market perspective, there\u2019s no difference in terms of the outcome. There\u2019s really going to be a vacuum when it comes to France\u2019s legislative ability.\"\n\n\"The bond market is going to be the real place to look at. There might be a bit of a gap lower in French bonds (prices).\"\n\n\"We\u2019re in for a period of policymaking not being able to do anything sizeable. Really and truly the reaction should be minimal. If we do see one it will be towards higher yields, lower euro and lower French stocks.\"\n\n\"The real question is who\u2019s going to be running and who\u2019s going to be the next prime minister.\n\n\"We\u2019re not going to see much in terms of fiscal policy.\"\n\nHOLGER SCHMIEDING, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BERENBERG, LONDON:\n\n\"This (projected result) is a serious relief for Europe as the euroscpetic far-right appear to have done far less well than expected.\"\n\n\"The tail risks have been avoided. The left Alliance, although strong is not close to a majority and (Marine) Le Pen is far behind, far away from the majority.\"\n\n\"Still, it will be difficult for France to form a government and as the most likely potential outcome is now some arrangement between parts of the left and (President Emmanuel) Macron. That will likely mean that Macron has to shift and the left will be able to have some influence on policy.\n\n\"This could mean some reform reversals rather than further reforms. The outcome I would say is less bad than could have been the case. It could have been much worse.\"\n\n\"For markets, basically the tail risks have been avoided. And although the left has unaffordable spending plans, the left will need allies and will only be able to implement some of their promises.\"\n\nJAN VON GERICH, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, NORDEA, HELSINKI:\n\n\"While the initial French election results still raise many questions, financial markets are likely to greet the vote with some relief. The results appear to show that the more moderate forces still ally in the second round against more extreme candidates, which also has repercussions for the next presidential election.\"\n\n\"That said, the economic programme of the left is in many ways much more problematic than that of the right, and while the left will not be able to govern on their own, the outlook for French public finances deteriorates further with these results. It is thus reasonable to expect somewhat higher risk premia in French assets to prevail also beyond the initial market reaction.\"\n\nBEN LAIDLER, HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY, BRADESCO BBI, LONDON:\n\n\"There\u2019s obviously going to be a little bit of relief that the far right fell short much more than expected but we\u2019re still left with an uncomfortable surprise of the left wing doing much better than expected.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s going to probably bring an end to this tentative euro and French stocks rally we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of days. It represents more uncertainty from an angle that markets had maybe taken their eye off.\"\n\n\"One caveat though is that a big slug of this euro rally had nothing to do with what was going on in France. It had a lot to do with the dollar weakening on clearer signs of the U.S. economy slowing.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to digest. But this is going to be a hung parliament. There\u2019s going to be limited ability for anybody to be able to do too much.\"",

    "body": "(Reuters) - France's left-wing New Popular Front (NFP), an alliance of parties hastily assembled after President Emmanuel Macron called a surprise snap parliamentary election, looked set to score a shock win in Sunday's vote over the far right and the ruling centrists.\n\nIf initial projections are confirmed, Macron will be required to name a prime minister from the bloc. The initial estimates are typically accurate.\n\nThe NFP - made up of the Communist Party, the hard left France Unbowed, the Green party and the Socialist Party - has not said who would be its pick for prime minister. The following are some of its best-known figures:\n\nJEAN-LUC MELENCHON, HARD LEFT FRANCE UNBOWED PARTY\n\nJean-Luc Melenchon, 72, has been a fixture in French left-wing politics for decades and held ministerial posts in past governments, when he was a member of the Socialist Party.\n\nHe ran for president in 2012, 2017 and 2022, improving his score each time. He came third in 2022, just behind far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Macron won that election.\n\nA fiery orator, Melenchon is one of the most divisive figures in French politics, enthusing some voters while horrifying others with his unbridled tax-and-spend proposals, class war rhetoric and controversial foreign policy positions, especially on Gaza. Critics accuse him of antisemitism, which he denies.\n\nMARINE TONDELIER, LEADER OF THE GREENS\n\nTondelier, 37, grew up in Henin-Beaumont, a town in northern France that is well-known as a bastion of the far-right National Rally (RN) and its leader Le Pen.\n\nTondelier has a long record of opposing the RN.\n\nShe was elected as an opposition member of the town's municipal council in 2014. She documented her experiences working under an RN mayor and what she described as the oppressive atmosphere generated by the far-right administration in a 2017 book entitled \"News from the Front\".\n\nTondelier was also elected to a northern regional council in 2021, and she became leader of France's best-known ecologist party, the Greens, the following year.\n\nRAPHAEL GLUCKSMANN, SOCIALIST PARTY\n\nRaphael Glucksmann, 44, headed the Socialist list of candidates in the European elections in early June. It obtained nearly 14% of the vote, just behind Macron's Together group. This was considered a sign of revival for a party that governed France in past decades but had recently fallen into electoral oblivion.\n\nGlucksmann attended prestigious schools and had a career in journalism and broadcasting before branching out in a variety of directions, including being an adviser to then Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili.\n\nHe advocates strong European support for Ukraine in its resistance against Russia's invasion.\n\nLAURENT BERGER, FORMER CFDT TRADE UNION LEADER\n\nLaurent Berger, 55, is a former head of one of France's main trade unions, the moderate CFDT. He has a track record of strong opposition to the RN.\n\nBerger has said he does not want to be prime minister, but others on the left have put his name forward, saying he could be a unifying figure and a popular alternative to Melenchon.",

    "body": "After a holiday-shortened week, investors will closely watch the upcoming inflation report, which is the key highlight of the upcoming week. Last week, the labor market showed fresh signs of moderation.\n\nJune's nonfarm payroll figures showed an increase of 206,000 jobs, a slight decrease from May's revised count of 218,000. Moreover, the U.S. unemployment rate experienced a slight uptick, moving from 4% to 4.1%, which surpasses the Federal Reserve's projection of a 4% rate for the current year.\n\nInflationary pressures, which have been a concern for both markets and policymakers, may also be showing signs of easing. The ISM's prices paid index, which can foreshadow the inflation trends for goods and services, reported lower-than-expected figures, aligning with the lowest rates since the pandemic's end.\n\nFurthermore, the annual wage gains from the nonfarm jobs report were at 3.9%, a decrease from May's 4.1% and one of the lowest since the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn our view, if inflation continues to moderate and the economy softens but does not fall into a downturn or recession, markets should continue to perform well. It implies the Fed will likely begin its interest rate-cutting cycle, even as the economy is growing near trend levels,\u201d Edward Jones strategists said in a note.\n\n\u201cIf the economy falters and the Fed must cut rates to support growth, markets will likely not hold up as well \u2013 but we don\u2019t see signs of this. Keep in mind that the economy and labor market started from a position of outsized strength that may now be gradually normalizing.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead.\n\nPresident Biden\n\nPresident Joe Biden faced increased skepticism from within his own party regarding his potential 2024 reelection campaign. The concerns were not alleviated following his recent interview with ABC News, which was anticipated to address these issues.\n\nAdding to the Democratic unease, two additional lawmakers, Rep. Mike Quigley from Illinois and Rep. Angie Craig from Minnesota, publicly urged Biden to reconsider his intention to run for president again.\n\nThe calls from Quigley and Craig for Biden to step aside come as a notable development considering their status as members of his party. Their statements contribute to a larger sentiment of doubt that has been slowly surfacing among Democratic lawmakers, strategists, and donors.\n\nThe increasing voices of dissent within the Democratic Party suggest a search for alternative strategies or candidates that could strengthen their chances in the forthcoming electoral contest.\n\n\u201cIt is hard for us to see how this uncertainty can drag out for more than another few weeks,\u201d TD Cowen strategists wrote.\n\nPowell\u2019s speech\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to testify Tuesday and Wednesday before the Senate and House, respectively. While the hearings are mainly focused on monetary policy, TD Cowen analysts also said they expect to see some questions regarding many regulatory questions.\n\n\u201cWe expect many questions on Basel 3 Endgame, long-term debt for regional banks and liquidity requirement changes,\u201d the strategists said.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that Powell will use those questions to set expectations for the Basel 3 Endgame capital proposal, the regional bank long-term debt proposal and the expected proposal on bank liquidity changes.\u201d\n\nCPI\n\nThe inflation report for June is set to be presented on Thursday, Jule 11. The Street expectations call for a 0.1% MoM and 3.1% YoY change. The core CPI is expected to increase by 0.2%.\n\nBank of America is aligned with the Street on both headline and core figures; however, it expects the YoY change to come in at 3.2%.\n\n\u201cShould the CPI report print in line with our expectations, we would maintain our expectation for the Fed to start its cutting cycle in December,\u201d Bank of America economists wrote.\n\n\u201cThat said, we do acknowledge that another 0.2% m/m print for Core CPI would tilt the risk towards an earlier cut especially given signs of softening activity.\u201d\n\nQ2 earnings season\n\nAs the early reports of the Q2 earnings season begin to emerge, indications point to a robust performance for companies. Projections for the second quarter of 2024 suggest earnings increase of 8.6% compared to the same period in the previous year, with revenues also expected to rise by 4.7%. This anticipated growth rate is the most significant since the 9.9% uptick observed in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe positive revisions trend leading up to this earnings cycle has set the stage for what appears to be a period of continued corporate resilience and an improving financial outlook. The forecasted earnings growth for the S&P 500 not only reflects a solid recovery but also marks a potential shift in momentum for the market.\n\nAs always, the Q2 earnings season is officially underway on Friday, when JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are scheduled to report.\n\nOther economic data\n\nIn addition to the much-anticipated CPI report, investors will also focus on weekly jobless claims, as well as on the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) report. These two are due on Thursday and Friday, respectively.",

    "body": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: ) stock downgraded at New Street Research\n\nNew Street Research analysts have downgraded Nvidia to Neutral from Buy on Friday.\n\nIn a note to clients, the research firm said that current consensus expectations project GPU revenues to rise by 35% in 2025, matching their prior forecast. Analysts said they see \u201climited further upside based on what we hear from the value chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as the upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\u201d\n\nNew Street highlighted that the consensus expects revenue growth to decelerate to the mid-teens, which may be at risk due to potential reductions in hyperscale capital expenditures and growing competition from ASICs and AMD (NASDAQ: ).\n\nAnalysts indicated that without a change in outlook, they do not see further upside for the stock. They warned of the risk of a possible derating, noting the stock currently trades at 40x next twelve months earnings per share (NTM EPS), compared to a low of 20x when growth slowed to 10% in 2019, before rebounding to 35x.\n\nNew Street values Nvidia at 35x earnings, consistent with the multiple seen in late 2019 and early 2020. With an estimated EPS of $4.1 in 2027, this translates to a target price of $143 in 2026, suggesting limited upside over the next two years.\n\nNew Street set a one-year target price for NVDA at $135.\n\n\u201cThe quality of the franchise is nevertheless intact, and we would be buyers again, but only on prolonged weakness,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\nUBS cuts Pure Storage (NYSE: ) to Sell, \u2018too much credit given to AI\u2019\n\nAll-flash data storage solution provider Pure Storage saw its stock receive a downgrade at UBS, from Neutral to Sell earlier this week.\n\nThe investment bank highlighted an unfavorable risk-reward profile for the stock, citing slowing growth, declining market share, high valuation, and \"too much credit given to AI.\"\n\nThe analysts forecast PSTG\u2019s growth to slow to around 8% over the next five years, down from 16% in the past five years. They expect the company's all-flash storage market share to stabilize around 15%. UBS's revenue projections for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 are 6% and 10% below consensus, respectively.\n\nThe downgrade also reflects a decrease in market share, with Pure's share of the all-flash storage market falling by approximately 80 basis points to 14.5% in the last twelve months, as competitors like NetApp (NASDAQ: )'s C-series gain traction with enterprise customers.\n\nMoreover, UBS noted the stock's significant rise, about 83% year-to-date, compared to the 's 15% gain, despite a 1% drop in revenue expectations for fiscal years 2025 and 2026.\n\nLastly, analysts mentioned that while AI infrastructure investments have boosted PSTG\u2019s valuation, \"AI-related storage spending will likely be slower than the market expects and more tied to inference, a slower growth market than training.\"\n\nDell new Top Pick at BofA\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America have added Dell to their US 1 List, a selection of the bank's top investment ideas.\n\nIn a note to clients, Bank of America raised its target price for Dell shares to $180 from $130, citing a positive outlook for the company heading into 2025. The bank highlighted factors such as AI server demand, storage demand from an expected IBM (NYSE: ) mainframe refresh, and demand from an anticipated PC refresh.\n\n\"Dell Technologies (NYSE: ) World 2024 took place May 20th-23rd where Dell introduced Dell AI Factory and expanded its AI portfolio with 5 new AI-PCs, all-flash file storage, network architecture, and AI services offerings,\" note BofA\u2019s team.\n\n\"We see these new products supporting Dell's growth in C25,\u201d it added.\n\nThe brokerage firm also mentioned that Dell's potential inclusion in the S&P 500 is another catalyst for the stock.\n\n\n\nMizuho: Amazon (NASDAQ: ) nearing AI inflection point\n\nAmazon is close to reaching a key AI inflection point, Mizuho analysts said in a note this week, citing a recent customer survey with a major channel partner.\n\nThe survey highlighted several trends suggesting accelerated growth for Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"We see an accelerated sales cycle from increased demand of ECB meetings and incremental exits of data center contracts,\" the note writes. Enterprises are finalizing proposals and prepaying contracts to leave data centers, speeding up AWS's sales cycle.\n\nWhile infrastructure spending remains dominant, Mizuho said that \"cost optimization is being offset by new services such as app monitoring, chatbot deployments, and large migration programs.\" This shift indicates a move towards higher-value services on AWS.\n\nThe most exciting development, according to Mizuho, is the progress on Generative AI projects.\n\n\"The survey shows external-facing models (20% of total) are only 6 months away from commercial deployment,\" the note says, implying a potential surge in inferencing activity as these models are deployed to a large external customer base.\n\nBofA lifts PTs on European chip stocks\n\nBank of America has raised its price targets for several European chipmakers, driven by continued strength in AI demand.\n\nThe bank\u2019s analysts raised their targets for several semiconductor capital equipment (semicaps) and subsystem suppliers, including Nokia (HE: ), Nordic Semiconductor (OL: ), Technoprobe, and Comet.\n\nNokia's target is now \u20ac3.96, up from \u20ac3.58, reflecting \u201cAI optionality.\u201d Nordic Semiconductor's target increased to NOK 169 from NOK 161, supported by improving end demand and higher estimates. Technoprobe's target is set at \u20ac10.60, up from \u20ac9.40, due to its unique AI exposure. Comet's target rose to CHF 448 from CHF 409.\n\nHowever, BofA reduced Aixtron\u2019s target to \u20ac20.5 from \u20ac25 due to lower expectations for gallium nitride (GaN), silicon carbide (SiC), and MicroLED.\n\nASML (AS: ) remains a top pick among semicaps for BofA, driven by the increased lithography intensity needed for AI chips.",

    "title": "Street Calls of the Week: Nvidia gets a rare downgrade By Investing.com",
    "body": "Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week, including a rare Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) stock downgrade.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving rating changes.\n\nIntercontinental Exchange (NYSE: )\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, Goldman Sachs upgraded Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) to Buy with a $167 price target.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman upgrades ICE from Neutral to Buy, setting a 12-month price target of $167, indicating a 22% upside. After less than 10% EPS growth over the last three years, Goldman sees ICE\u2019s EPS growth inflecting higher into the low teens in 2025 and beyond. This is supported by:\n\nStructural tailwinds and ICE\u2019s global leadership in Energy markets, which account for approximately 30% of earnings. These factors are expected to drive over 25% revenue growth in 2024E, with an estimated 8%-10% growth beyond 2024. Signs of accelerating growth in Fixed Income Data & Analytics, which make up about 22% of earnings. The firm\u2019s ASV is recovering and flows into fixed income funds are rebounding year-to-date. A cyclical trough in Mortgage Tech, which accounts for around 16% of earnings. Origination activity is stabilizing and ICE\u2019s organic initiatives are taking shape, driving high single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth in 2025 and 2026.\n\nThe research team expects the high incremental margin from ICE\u2019s fastest-growing Exchange revenues to support approximately 100 basis points per year operating margin expansion. This, along with high free cash flow conversion, is predicted to drive a faster pace of de-levering and higher share repurchases by the end of 2024.\n\nGoldman believes these dynamics are underappreciated, leaving them mid-single-digit above consensus (Visible Alpha Consensus Data) EPS at $6.14/$6.90/$7.88. As ICE\u2019s top-line growth accelerates and the firm de-levers, Goldman sees room for valuation to improve from the current 21X next twelve months P/E to over 22.5X, implying 16.5X EV/EBITDA, which is in line with history.\n\nBuy at Goldman means \u201cBeing assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock\u2019s total return potential relative to its coverage universe.\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Intercontinental Exchange opened the regular session at $138.47 and closed at $136.93, a gain of 0.19 percent from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nPure Storage (NYSE: )\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, UBS downgraded Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) to Sell with a $47 price target.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? UBS has downgraded Pure Storage shares from Neutral to Sell, citing an unfavorable risk/reward scenario. The analysts at UBS estimate a growth rate of approximately 8% over the next five years for PSTG, a decrease from the 16% growth rate experienced in the previous five years. They predict that PSTG\u2019s market share in the all-flash sector will plateau at around 15%. Furthermore, UBS\u2019s revenue forecasts for FY26 and FY27 are 6% and 10% below consensus, respectively.\n\nThe analysts have observed a decline in PSTG\u2019s last twelve months market share of the all-flash storage market by about 80 basis points to 14.5%, as competitors like NetApp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NTAP) C-series gain traction with enterprise customers.\n\nDespite a 1% decline in revenue expectations for both FY25 and FY26, PSTG\u2019s shares have surged approximately 83% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 15% increase. This indicates that the stock\u2019s appreciation has been driven entirely by multiple expansion to an elevated level of approximately 6 times EV/revenue.\n\nUBS also notes that PSTG\u2019s valuation has been overly influenced by optimistic views on AI infrastructure investments driving growth. However, the analysts believe that AI-related storage spending will likely grow slower than the market anticipates, with a greater focus on inference\u2014a market segment with slower growth compared to training.\n\nFurthermore, private vendors such as Weka, VAST Data, and Hammerspace are gaining market share, as demonstrated by Meta\u2019s (NASDAQ:META (NASDAQ: )) partnership with Hammerspace to develop and implement a parallel network file system in its GenAI clusters. This trend further supports UBS\u2019s decision to downgrade Pure shares to Sell\n\nSell at UBS means \u201cStock price expected to fall within three months from the time the rating was assigned because of a specific catalyst or event. FSR is > 6% below the MRA.\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Pure Storage opened the regular session at $61.21 and closed at $62.74, a decline of 4.20 percent from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nCharter Communications (NASDAQ: )\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday (shortened trading day in the US Markets), Citi downgraded Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) to Sell with a $255 price target.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Citi analysts have expressed concerns regarding Charter's financial outlook, citing increased risks to both earnings estimates and market valuation. They point to a challenging organic broadband landscape that is proving tougher than previously anticipated, which could impact subscriber numbers and revenue growth negatively over the next year. Analysts believe consensus expectations for Charter's 2025 EBITDA may be overly optimistic given these headwinds.\n\nIn response to these concerns, the bank has adjusted its target price downwards, reflecting a contraction in the fair value-to-EBITDA multiple to 6.0x. This adjustment is based on Citi's own projections, which predict lower EBITDA figures compared to market consensus for 2025. However, analysts at Citi acknowledge the potential for future free cash flow recovery once Charter navigates through its current phase of heightened capital investments.\n\nLooking ahead, Citi views Charter's upcoming second and third-quarter results as potentially unfavorable catalysts. They anticipate these earnings reports to underscore the challenges facing Charter, particularly in broadband pricing and subscriber volumes. The recent discontinuation of ACP (All-Channel Programming) is highlighted as a contributing factor to these headwinds, with analysts expressing skepticism about a near-term turnaround in this regard.\n\nSell at Citi means \u201cThe Investment rating definitions are: Buy ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell for negative ETR.\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Charter Communications opened the regular session at $299.19 and closed at $301.25, a gain of 1.72 percent from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nThursday - US Market Closed\n\nNvidia\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, New Street Research downgraded Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to Neutral with a $135 price target.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? New Street's analysis indicates that consensus expectations suggest a robust 35% increase in GPU revenues by 2025, aligning closely with their earlier forecasts leading into earnings.\n\nHowever, the brokerage perceives limited potential for further upside, citing insights gathered from the industry value chain. Consequently, New Street downgrades the stock to Neutral, emphasizing that significant additional gains would depend on a bullish scenario where post-2025 prospects notably improve, a development the brokerage currently finds uncertain.\n\nLooking ahead, consensus projections anticipate a deceleration in revenue growth to the mid-teens, a trend that could be jeopardized by moderating hyperscale capital expenditures and potential market share gains by ASICs and AMD (NASDAQ: ). In this unchanged outlook scenario, New Street anticipates little additional upside for the stock, potentially even facing the risk of a valuation adjustment.\n\nCurrently trading at 40x next twelve months' earnings per share, the stock previously saw its multiple decline to 20x during a period of slowed growth in 2019, rebounding to 35x more recently.\n\nNew Street values Nvidia at 35x earnings, reminiscent of late 2019 to early 2020 valuation levels. With an anticipated EPS of $4.1 by 2027 in their base case, translating to a target price of $143 by 2026, New Street's one-year target price is set at $135.\n\nDespite these metrics, the brokerage acknowledges the enduring quality of Nvidia's business franchise, expressing readiness to recommend buying the stock again, particularly during extended periods of market weakness.\n\nHow did the stock react? Nvidia opened the regular session at $127.41 and closed at $125.83, a decline of 1.91 percent from the prior day\u2019s regular close.",

    "body": "Investing.com -- The healthcare sector has lagged consistently behind the benchmark for the past 12 months, according to analysts at Wells Fargo.\n\nIn a note to clients on July 1, they added that, like much of the broader market, the gains in the sector have been very narrow, with only a few stocks performing well during that time.\n\nPart of the reason for the sector-wide weakness, they argued, is that the healthcare sector has only a limited number of players exposed to artificial intelligence. This has weighed on the industry, particularly as during a period when many investors are focusing on growth stocks linked to the nascent technology.\n\nThe analysts also said that the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates has lessened the allure of defensive healthcare stocks, small caps, and other \"rate-sensitive sub-sectors such as Biotechnology.\"\n\nThey added that the growing popularity of GLP-1 obesity drugs, while boosting a handful of companies, has exacerbated \"concerns over the potentially negative impact on certain key markets within healthcare.\"\n\nEven still, the analysts said investors could face an \"attractive buying opportunity\" from healthcare's underperformance, especially as the Federal Reserve possibly looks to roll out interest rate cuts this year.\n\n\"Given our favorable guidance on the sector and optimism about its outlook, we believe the current environment offers long-term investors the opportunity to build core positions in healthcare names,\" the analysts said.",

    "body": "Analysts have underestimated this bull market at every turn, Alpine Macro strategists said in a recent note. Despite widespread skepticism, the global investment firm believes equities are poised to continue surpassing expectations, driven by broadening earnings growth and a resilient economy.\n\nAt the midpoint of the year, the is trading higher than the top price targets set by Wall Street strategists heading into 2024. This bullish trend points to a significant disconnect between market performance and analyst predictions, with strategist targets being the furthest below actual price levels on record in recent quarters. Fund flows have mirrored this miscalculation, with investors remaining underexposed to equities during this rally.\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the misunderstanding of this bull market, according to Alpine Macro. Firstly, the much-anticipated recession has yet to materialize.\n\n\u201cThere has been a slowdown, consistent with tightening financial conditions, but it\u2019s morphed into a rolling profit recession across some sectors as opposed to a broader decline,\u201d strategists wrote.\n\nIn addition, mega tech companies have emerged as an idiosyncratic block, less vulnerable to macro influences, allowing the broader large-cap U.S. equity index to power ahead.\n\nThanks to these developments, corporate earnings have accelerated and topped expectations. The secular tailwinds propelling mega tech have attracted global capital, boosting aggregate valuations.\n\nThe emergence of companies demonstrating record levels of quality, profitability, and visible growth is a significant feature of the U.S. large-cap equity market. These companies are largely insulated from the traditional business cycle, being more closely tied to the adoption cycle of ubiquitous technologies.\n\n\u201cTheir asset-lite characteristics also make them more immune to interest-rate policy,\u201d the firm noted.\n\n\u201cIn a period of unusually high uncertainty, we find it reasonable for most elements of Mega Tech to achieve large valuation premiums as investors prioritize visible sources of quality growth,\u201d it added.\n\nThe current bull market is further fueled by the broadening of earnings growth. Sectors that have managed through rolling recessions are now set to enjoy stabilizing revenues and expanding profit margins.\n\nHistorical trends suggest profit margins bounce back soon after major cycle troughs, hinting at more upside to come.\n\n\"Our corporate earnings model projects earnings of approximately $59 in Q2, and closer to $240 on an annualized basis,\" the report states. \u201cThe bottom-up estimate, which aggregates earnings data for each company, points to an even better outlook closer to $250 for this year.\u201d\n\nAlpine Macro strategists said an aggressive bull thesis for equities includes a potential \"catch-up\" move in valuations for the broader market, aligning it with the high valuations enjoyed by Mega Cap leaders.\n\nThey illustrate the trajectory of the S&P 500 if the rest of the market experienced the same degree of expansion as the Magnificent 7 since 2023. If this catch-up were to occur, the implied value of the S&P 500 would be closer to 6,500 rather than its current level.\n\n\"Of course, this is a stretched assumption,\" they caution.\n\nTheir fair-value valuation model, which incorporates a variety of fundamental and cross-asset inputs, suggests a fair-value price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 20x. Applying this valuation across the entire index would imply a price level of 5,200. However, applying this multiple to the rest of the index while keeping Mega Tech valuations constant would produce a price level of 5,700.\n\n\"Given our expectation for the trajectory of earnings growth, we find this to be a reasonable intermediate target,\" the strategists conclude.",

    "body": "Yardeni Research analysts have raised concerns about the ongoing AI technology rally, identifying two major risks that could potentially derail the sector's explosive growth.\n\nWhile AI promises revolutionary changes across industries, there are signs of \"AI Inflation\" that warrant caution.\n\nFirstly, the unprecedented flow of funds into AI startups is a red flag. Yardeni Research highlights that \"investors have poured $330 billion into 26,000 AI startups over the past three years,\" significantly more than in previous years.\n\nWhile this influx of capital has fueled innovation, it has also led to a crowded market with many companies struggling to turn a profit, according to the firm. For instance, they note Stability AI has faced financial difficulties, resulting in layoffs and the departure of its CEO.\n\nSimilarly, they add that Inflection AI, despite raising over $1.5 billion, saw its leadership leave for Microsoft (NASDAQ: ). The concern is that \"if AI startups run out of cash, their suppliers could find AI-related revenues dry up quickly.\"\n\nSecondly, analysts caution that the claims made by AI industry leaders suggest a potential bubble. Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s CEO, Jensen Huang, has described their Blackwell architecture platform as possibly \"the most successful product in the history of the computer.\"\n\nHowever, analysts caution that they \"don't believe the semiconductor cycle is dead,\" and AI's efficiency gains may not entirely circumvent the industry's inherent volatility.\n\nYardeni Research acknowledges AI's potential but notes that \"doubling the size of the world economy in a decade is quite a claim.\"\n\nIn summary, Yardeni Research feels that while AI holds significant promise, these two risks\u2014excessive capital influx and overhyped expectations\u2014highlight the need for investors to remain cautious amid the current AI tech rally.",

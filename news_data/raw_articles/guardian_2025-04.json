Photograph: \u00c1lex Caparr\u00f3s/Uefa/Getty Images Share Updated at 23.30 CEST\n\n30 Apr 2025 23.15 CEST Inter midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan talks to TNT Sports. \u201cIt was a crazy game \u2026 a great game to watch but not to play \u2026 it was very hard \u2026 we did our best \u2026 we could have done even better \u2026 we were leading 2-0 with 20 minutes gone, but it was not that we thought we\u2019d won the game already \u2026 Barca put loads of pressure on us \u2026 unfortunately we couldn\u2019t keep the 3-2 \u2026 but this is football \u2026 I feel very gutted [that his second-half goal was disallowed] \u2026 maybe it was two or three centimetres \u2026 but this is football \u2026 my will was too much that I wanted to score \u2026 maybe I rushed \u2026 maybe I have to score in the second leg, let\u2019s see! \u2026 Barcelona are very young and talented \u2026 we are going to do our best \u2026 it is not going to be easy because we have lost our captain and leader Lautaro Mart\u00ednez \u2026 we will do our best to replace him and play without him.\u201d Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 23.03 CEST At the end of a game that\u2019s put the 2010 semi-final meeting between these clubs into perspective, Lamine Yamal is awarded a shirt with the number 100 on it. He may only be 17 years old, but that\u2019s already his century of appearances for Barcelona! And how he marked the occasion, twisting in from the right to score a solo stunner in the style of Archie Gemmill in power-up mode. That changed the momentum of a match which saw Inter fly out of the blocks, Marcus Thuram scoring the fastest semi-final goal in Champions League history, and Denzil Dumfries making it 0-2 with an overhead kick. After Yamal\u2019s art piece, Ferran Torres and Dumfries went on to trade further goals, before Raphinha made it 3-3 with a lashing drive off both crossbar and the back of the unfortunate Yann Sommer. It could have finished 7-3, 3-7 or anything in between, and it\u2019s all got to happen again in Milan in six days time. Can\u2019t wait. View image in fullscreen Wonder how many more of those shirts that Lamine Yamal get over his career.

Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.52 CEST 90 min +2: \u2026 a brief game of Head Tennis breaks out, but Inter are never in danger. Lopez eventually hoicks a poor cross from the left out for a goal kick. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.51 CEST 90 min +1: Raphinha advances down the inside left and sends a speculative riser towards the top right. Sommer tips over spectacularly. No unlucky rebound off the bar and his back this time. But here comes a corner, from which \u2026 Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.50 CEST 90 min: There will be three additional minutes. Can\u2019t we have 33? A third half? Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.49 CEST 89 min: It\u2019s attack versus defence again. Yamal nearly finds Lopez with a clever chip down the middle, but Darmian\u2019s telescopic leg hooks clear. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.47 CEST 87 min: Torres advances on the Inter box and feeds Yamal to his right. The pass isn\u2019t the best, and gets between Yamal\u2019s feet, but the young genius somehow manages to dig it out and wedges an effort over Sommer and off the crossbar! He\u2019d been quiet for a while. Too quiet. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.45 CEST 85 min: Barca probe. Inter sit tight. Raphinha curls in from the left, hoping to find the head of Garcia. But Garcia clanks into Augusto, who goes down and wins a free kick. He doesn\u2019t rush to get back up. Eventually he does. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.42 CEST 83 min: Barcelona respond with a double swap of their own. Gavi and Christensen come on for Cubars\u00ed and Pedri. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.42 CEST 81 min: Inter make a double change with a view to taking the heat out of this wonderfully preposterous match. Thuram and the magnificent Dumfries make way for Zieli\u0144ski and Darmian. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.40 CEST 79 min: Yamal stands on the ball and spins away from Thuram with absurd ease. He nearly manages to release Raphinha down the left with an outside-of-boot diagonal pass, but it\u2019s intercepted. Then Inter try to send Dumfries clear down the right, but Szcz\u0119sny races out of his box to blooter clear. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.38 CEST 78 min: Yamal jigs in from the right and draws a foul from Mkhitaryan (who was only offside back there by the length of an uncut toenail). From the resulting free kick, Raphinha whistles a low curler towards the bottom left, but Sommer is behind it all the way. This game is gloriously nuts. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.37 CEST 76 min: \u2026 and now Dumfries one-twos with Frattesi down the right and into the Barca box. He has the opportunity to shoot from ten yards but opts for the cutback. Wrong choice. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.36 CEST 75 min: Inter have the ball in the net again! Dumfries is sent bombing down the right by Bisseck. He crosses low and long for Mkhitaryan, who races in from the left and slams home with his first touch! But he\u2019s an inch offside.

Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters Share Updated at 22.47 CEST\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.34 CEST 74 min: Until Inter scored their third, this match was attack versus defence. Now it\u2019s an end-to-end basketball-infused affair. Now it\u2019s Barca\u2019s turn to attack, Lopez with the chance of releasing Raphinha into the box down the left, only to overcook the pass. Both teams fancy this. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.32 CEST 72 min: Anything could happen here. Thuram blazes down the middle and for a second looks to have burst clear of Cubarsi, but the Barca defender does well to make up some ground and block the eventual shot with an extended leg. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.31 CEST 71 min: Sixty seconds of hot administrative action, as Cubarsi is booked for a tug on Taremi, then \u00c7alhano\u011flu makes way for Frattesi. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.30 CEST 70 min: Thuram carelessly gifts the ball to Lopez on the edge of the Inter box. Lopez dribbles a shot straight at Sommer, and Thuram breathes again. That was a decent chance. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.28 CEST 68 min: Olmo is replaced by Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.27 CEST 67 min: One minute and 53 seconds passed between those two goals. This is one of the great semis. And there\u2019s still a quarter of it left! Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.26 CEST GOAL! Barcelona 3-3 Inter (Sommer og 65) The corner\u2019s pulled back. Yamal leaves it for Raphinha, who creams a first-time riser towards the top right. The ball caroms off the underside of the bar, then off the back of the keeper and in. What terrible luck for the keeper, who touched that onto the bar, but that was all Raphinha\u2019s work. What a strike! View image in fullscreen Barcelona\u2019s Raphinha lets fly from distance.

Dumfries rises above Olmo at the far stick and plants a header into the top left. Easy as that! View image in fullscreen Denzel Dumfries (centre) scores his second, and Inter\u2019s third. Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty Images Share Updated at 22.31 CEST\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.23 CEST 62 min: This is better from Inter, as Thuram sends Dumfries into space down the right. Dumfries looks to hook into the middle, but his low cross is deflected out by Ara\u00fajo. Inter claim a penalty, preposterously, as it hit the defender\u2019s leg. But it doesn\u2019t matter, because \u2026 Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.22 CEST 61 min: Inter are reduced to repeatedly hacking the ball upfield to nobody in particular. Cubarsi stupidly gives them an out by jumping all over the back of Thuram. From the resulting free kick, a long pass down the middle appears to be handled by Mart\u00ednez. Barella claims a free kick but there\u2019s nothing doing. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.19 CEST 59 min: \u00c7alhano\u011flu receives the first caution of the evening, clattering through the back of Pedri, who had diddled him with a drop of the shoulder and was off into space. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.17 CEST 58 min: Yamal exchanges cute passes with Olmo down the inside-right channel, then attempts to surprise Sommer with a cheeky toe-poke towards the bottom right from distance. Sommer reads his opponent well, and gathers. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.15 CEST 56 min: \u2026 so Inter make a change, swapping Dimarco for Augusto, who now has the responsibility of keeping Yamal quiet. Good luck and godspeed, sir. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.14 CEST 55 min: Yamal dribbles down the right. His cross is half cleared. Pedri sends a low pearler wide right. It\u2019s all Barca. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.14 CEST 54 min: Barca stay patient. Inter aren\u2019t seeing much of the ball and they can\u2019t get out of their final third. View image in fullscreen Inter coach Simone Inzaghi (right) urges on his team. Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters Share Updated at 22.20 CEST\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.12 CEST 52 min: Barca pin Inter back. Yamal probes down the right. Martinez crosses low from the left. The visitors hack clear. Barca start again. This could be the pattern of the second half, right here. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.11 CEST 50 min: Bisseck pulls a low cross back from the right. Dimarco, romping in from the left, sends a rising shot over the bar. It might have grazed the top of the frame, but the ball was going so fast, it\u2019s hard to say for sure. View image in fullscreen Inter's Federico Dimarco fires off a shot before Barcelona's Eric Garcia can block. Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters Share Updated at 22.18 CEST\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.09 CEST 49 min: Yamal has the opportunity to release Raphinha down the left, but overcooks the pass. Nobody\u2019s perfect. Meanwhile Scott Blair writes: \u201cI make no claim to be a well-informed observer of the fitba\u2019 but I\u2019m 61 and largely enjoy it as an entertaining diversion rather than following a particular team. (I like to see Scotland do well, if that provides perspective.) Accordingly I\u2019ve seen a lot of goals over the years. I genuinely don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen anyone do that before.\u201d Scott\u2019s teasing us about Archie Gemmill, isn\u2019t he, readers. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.06 CEST 47 min: A free kick for Inter, just left of centre, 40 yards out. Barella scoops a diagonal ball towards Thuram, who is easily beaten to it by Szcz\u0119sny on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box. No super-fast start to the half for Inter this time. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 22.04 CEST Barcelona get the second half started. As expected, Inter have been forced into a change, their injured captain Lautaro Mart\u00ednez making way for Mehdi Taremi. Barca meanwhile have swapped out Gerard Mart\u00edn for Ronald Ara\u00fajo. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 21.50 CEST HALF TIME: Barcelona 2-2 Inter The fastest-ever goal in a Champions League semi. A spectacular overhead kick. An exquisitely cushioned assist. Lamine Yamal. Lamine Yamal. Lamine Yamal. That \u2026 that was football. Share Updated at 21.56 CEST\n\n30 Apr 2025 21.47 CEST 45 min: There will be two additional first-half minutes. Can we not have 22, please? Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 21.47 CEST 44 min: Mart\u00ednez suddenly pulls up. He wants to come off, but Simone Inzaghi screams at his captain to continue. Martinez hobbles around, but stays on for now. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 21.45 CEST 43 min: Raphinha tries to score with a sidefoot into the bottom left from 25 yards. It\u2019s blocked out for a corner, and from the set piece, Lamal nearly successfully one-twos his way down the right channel and into a shooting position. He\u2019s crowded out just in time. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 21.43 CEST 42 min: Kounde can\u2019t continue, and Eric Garc\u00eda comes on in his stead. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 21.42 CEST 40 min: Kounde goes down holding his left leg. On comes the trainer. The only way the ferocious pace of this game could be halted. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 21.40 CEST GOAL! Barcelona 2-2 Inter (Torres 38) Yeah, they\u2019ve responded well all right. Pedri, in space down the inside-right channel, crosses long towards Raphinha, who cushions a header back across goal and into the path of Torres, who gets in ahead of Acerbi and can\u2019t miss from six yards. Barca are level! That was so simple yet so perfectly executed. Inter ripped apart with ease.

Barca have responded so well to the toxic shock of going two goals down at home, in short order, in a European semi-final. Against an Italian team. Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 21.38 CEST 36 min: Yamal wins the ball in the middle of the park with a crunching tackle on Bastoni. This lad can do it all. Barca break and Olmo aims for the bottom right. Sonner turns around the post for a corner \u2026 Share\n\n30 Apr 2025 21.37 CEST 34 min: Yamal again down the right. Another cross. Dimarco sent to the shops for the Mundo Deportivo this time. Sonner slaps away, just in time, with Raphinha lurking. This is getting old. Share",

    "title": "Rugby Australia posts $36.8m deficit amid wait for financial windfall to arrive",
    "body": "Rugby Australia says it has \u201cchanged the trajectory\u201d of the sport despite recording a deficit of $36.8m in 2024, as the organisation looks forward to the commercial windfall of this year\u2019s British and Irish Lions tour and the coming men\u2019s 2027 and women\u2019s 2029 World Cups.\n\nThe governing body also took the opportunity at its results announcement to lash out at efforts to poach Australia\u2019s best young talent, after the pursuit this year of multiple junior Wallabies by French recruiters.\n\nOperating expenses grew $26m to $156m due to costs of running the NSW Waratahs, ACT Brumbies and now-defunct Melbourne Rebels, and an increase in player payments and match day costs related to hosting more international matches.\n\nRA oversaw six home Wallabies fixtures in 2024 compared to two in 2023, but revenue grew only $1.9m to $126.3m. The annual report noted the commercial program experienced a \u201cchallenging year\u201d due to a poor performance by the Wallabies at the 2023 World Cup and uncertainty in Super Rugby Pacific.\n\nPhil Waugh, chief executive of RA, said 2024\u2019s financial losses had been anticipated and the game was still on track to pay off a $80m loan agreement with Pacific Equity Partners (PEP) this year.\n\n\u201cRA is forecasting a record surplus in 2025 which should provide us the option of exiting the credit facility with PEP,\u201d Waugh said. \u201cAustralian rugby then enters a new, substantially upweighted five-year broadcast cycle from 2026.\n\n\u201cAnd in 2027 and 2029, Australia will welcome the world to our shores for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s editions of our sport\u2019s grandest tournament, the Rugby World Cup. \u201c\n\nThe code carried the financial burden of several challenges in 2024 that should now be in the past. These include the $10.3m integration of the Waratahs and Brumbies, $5.1m in outlays associated with the exit of the Rebels and almost $7m in interest charges.\n\nRA argues the game is in a healthy on-field state, reporting player participation across clubs, events and schools grew almost 15% and finally returned to pre-Covid levels.\n\nDaniel Herbert, RA chairperson, said it was a \u201cyear of transformation\u201d. \u201cThe game in Australia has made significant progress over the last 12 months and, while that is no doubt pleasing, we are acutely aware that there is still plenty of work ahead of us for Australian rugby to realise its full potential,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cReform of the magnitude Rugby Australia completed in 2024 inevitably requires one-off strategic costs and investments, which are represented in the annual report. Those outlays have changed the trajectory of Australian rugby and placed the game on a strong footing for the future, reflected in the significantly improved five-year broadcast deal with Nine announced last week.\u201d\n\nThe arrangement with Nine is reportedly worth up to $240m, or more than $40m per year. The previous deal was worth about $100m over three years.\n\nThe new deal includes a proportion of free advertising, as well as incentives for on-field performance.\n\nMore than 500,000 tickets are expected to be sold for the Lions tour this year, generating a one-in-12-year financial bonanza driving the administration\u2019s optimism.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Breakdown Free weekly newsletter The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "title": "Jimmy Kimmel on Hegseth bringing his wife to meetings: \u2018Maybe she\u2019s his designated driver\u2019",
    "body": "With several hosts still on holiday, Jimmy Kimmel reacts to reports of a screaming match at the White House and Pete Hegseth bringing his wife to meetings.\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nThursday was Bring Your Child To Work Day, and indeed, \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot of childish behavior at the White House as of late,\u201d said Kimmel. For example, Axios reported that Elon Musk had an expletive-filled, chest-to-chest shouting match outside the Oval Office with treasury secretary Scott Bessent over who would run the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nBessent reportedly confronted Musk in a hallway, and \u201cthe F-bombs started to fly \u2013 or at least, that\u2019s what Pete Hegseth texted his wife and brother,\u201d Kimmel quipped.\n\nThe White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, \u201cput her own spin on it\u201d, Kimmel noted. In a statement, Leavitt said: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret President Trump has put together a team of people who are incredibly passionate about the issues impacting our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Because this is Scott Bessent,\u201d Kimmel said next to a photo of a very corporate looking, grey-haired white man. \u201cThis is a guy who is incredibly passionate? Looks like the only F-word he\u2019s used before this is fiber. Scott Bessent looks like Will Ferrell playing George Bush playing Janet Reno.\u201d\n\nThe argument was allegedly so loud that it interrupted a meeting between Trump and the prime minister of Italy. \u201cThey say no one has screamed that loud in the White House since the time Eric got his penis caught in the resolute desk,\u201d Kimmel joked.\n\nThe host then turned to another beleaguered Trump official: Hegseth, the defense secretary, under fire this week for sending more sensitive information in a second Signal group chat that included his wife and other family members.\n\nAdditionally, numerous officials were reportedly annoyed when Hegseth brought his wife to meetings they assumed were one-on-one. The Pentagon denied the reports; according to Sean Parnell, the chief spokesperson for the Pentagon, Jennifer Hegseth \u201cnever attended a meeting where sensitive information or classified information was discussed\u201d.\n\n\u201cOf course she hasn\u2019t \u2013 she doesn\u2019t need to. If there\u2019s anything exciting, he catches her up on a text,\u201d Kimmel retorted.\n\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a good reason for her to be at the meetings. Maybe she\u2019s his designated driver,\u201d he added.\n\nKimmel also mocked reports that Hegseth had a makeup booth installed at the Pentagon for on-camera interviews, which the defense secretary denied; instead, according to a spokesperson, Hegseth does his own makeup.\n\n\u201cThe good news is, when he gets booted from the Pentagon, he\u2019ll be able to get a job at Sephora,\u201d Kimmel joked. \u201cThe defense secretary has a makeup room, the vice-president wears eyeliner, and yet somehow this administration spends all day every day complaining about trans women ruining sports.\u201d",

    "title": "Digested week: Memories of Wizbit, high hopes for Bill and Ted",
    "body": "Monday\n\nI did what a lot of people did on hearing news of the death of Pope Francis on Monday: I watched Conclave. The Oscar-nominated movie, adapted from the Robert Harris novel, unpacks the process of electing a new pope and between Sunday and Monday, it enjoyed a 283% surge in streaming figures. I\u2019d like to say it deepened my understanding of life in the Vatican, but the truth is it just made me wish we could have Ralph Fiennes for pope, while reminding me \u2013 I\u2019m not alone in this \u2013 that we\u2019ve seen quite enough of Stanley Tucci for the time being.\n\nThe pope\u2019s demise was foreshadowed by an event that, like a plague of locusts, should trigger anticipatory dread in any context, which is the appearance of JD Vance. Vance, a Catholic convert, was granted a brief audience with the pope on Easter Sunday, after what People magazine described as his \u201cbrushing off\u201d by the pontiff the day before. After Vance\u2019s departure, the pope delivered his Easter address via an aide, which included the line: \u201cHow much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalised, and migrants!\u201d \u2013 surely a one-star Yelp review directed at the US vice-president.\n\nNow we must wait; for the funeral on Saturday, followed by the puff of white smoke to indicate the election of a new pope, a reminder that the Catholic church never shortchanges on theatrics. Among the handful of lead contenders we are, of course, feverishly hoping for success for the candidate with the name that\u2019s a small but perfect gift from God: the Italian cardinal and top Vatican official to the Middle East, Pierbattista Pizzaballa.\n\nTuesday\n\nSometimes life rewards us with just the thing we need at exactly the point when we need it and this week it\u2019s the announcement that Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves will revive their turn as Bill and Ted, only this time in a Broadway production of Samuel Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot.\n\nThe double act, more than 30 years on from the original Bill and Ted movie, are surely perfectly suited to play Beckett\u2019s absurdist characters Vladimir (Alex) and Estragon (Reeves), a whimsical piece of casting for a play that will open at the Hudson theatre in New York in September for a limited run through to January. I last saw the play more than 10 years ago on Broadway in a production starring Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. It was mainly very good, while also suffering from a phenomenon that occasionally strikes when very famous actors take to the stage: the delight the actors took in the delight of the audience occasionally poked a hole in the drama. Let\u2019s hope John Wick-does-Beckett \u2013 a premise I couldn\u2019t love more \u2013 avoids too much smirking self-reference.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018It certainly is hilarious, Gary, that people find your thoughts about Israel as pertinent as mine.\u2019 Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Media\n\nWednesday\n\nWhere do the words \u201cthe Magic Circle\u201d take you? If you\u2019re under 40, probably nowhere. But for anyone older, news this week of a long overdue resolution to a 34-year-old injustice among this country\u2019s professional magicians, summoned an avalanche of images.\n\nIn 1991, a woman called Sophie Lloyd disguised herself as a man to trick Magic Circle examiners into admitting her into the male-only society. Later that year, when the Magic Circle changed its rules and admitted its first woman member \u2013 Debbie McGee! Wife of Paul Daniels! \u2013 Lloyd unveiled her deception, and the Circle elders were so furious they ejected her. Until this week, that is, when the Circle tracked Lloyd down, apologised, and presented her with membership.\n\nLloyd was delightful on the Today programme and the entire episode has been borne along on winds of eccentricity Samuel Beckett himself couldn\u2019t have improved upon. And while there\u2019s no explaining to the uninitiated what it all means, I urge the young and curious to find the nearest person with bags under their eyes, say the word \u201cWizbit\u201d and watch them go. (\u201cHa ha this away, ha ha that away\u201d \u2013 sad to imagine what had to be displaced in my psyche in order for this to hang on for four decades like knotweed.)\n\nThursday\n\nKristi Noem, famous for killing her dog and also being Trump\u2019s head of homeland security, had her bag stolen this week from under her chair in a restaurant in Washington DC and the startling detail is that it contained $3,000 in cash. (The bag also contained her driving licence and a bunch of blank cheques.) Brilliantly, none of the Secret Service agents present in the room noticed the theft.\n\nVia a spokesperson, Noem, who recently visited a prison facility wearing a $50,000 gold Rolex, explained why she had such a large amount of cash on her person. \u201cHer entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren. She was using the withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities and Easter gifts.\u201d This is all very well but, as we know, were Noem a random Salvadoran man with tattoos living in Maryland with this kind of cash on her, she\u2019d currently be sitting in a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nFriday\n\nDo you remember in 2016 when Priscilla Chan, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s wife, opened a tuition-free private school in Palo Alto dedicated to serving low income kids from communities of colour? It was called the Primary school and was, per reporting in the New York Times, committed to \u201cidentity development, diverse cultures and ideas\u201d, as well as social justice and a DEI task force.\n\nAnyway it\u2019s closing. Flabbergasted parents were summoned to a meeting this week and told the school would not operate beyond the summer of 2026. They were given no reason. \u201cMommy, the guy who\u2019s been giving money to our school doesn\u2019t want to give it to us any more,\u201d one kindergartner was reported as saying, a reminder that in this current vibe shift there is no target too little.",

    "title": "Andreeva and Gauff advance before Spain power outage halts play",
    "body": "Mirra Andreeva has spent the past two years of her life establishing herself as one of the most successful teenagers of her era, yet on a chaotic, surreal day in Madrid, the 17 year-old had to briefly work through playing conditions more familiar to her contemporaries on the junior circuit. During the final change of ends of her fourth-round match against the Ukrainian qualifier Yulia Starodubtseva, as she served for a comfortable victory, she learned of the power outage that had ravaged Spain, Portugal and many nearby countries, ultimately forcing play to be postponed in Madrid.\n\nAs matches across the tournament grounds had already come to a halt, the two players were told that they could play out the subsequent game, but there was a catch: the live electronic line\u2011calling system was no longer functioning and there were no line umpires to call upon. They would have to play as if they were juniors again, calling their own lines with only the umpire there to intervene. Naturally, Andreeva began to feel the pressure.\n\n\u201cIt was 15-40 on my serve and I was like: \u2018Oh, Mirra. Just please, please do everything in your power to just take this game and finish this match,\u2019\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI knew that if it would go to 5-5, probably we would have to wait. Probably I would not be here yet and I would just be waiting and we would just see what we would do.\u201d\n\nFrom double break point down, Andreeva pulled herself together and closed out the match. A few metres away on the neighbouring stadium court, her next opponent was also one of the fortunate players: Coco Gauff had been in the middle of her post\u2011match interview after a dominant win when the power shut down. Gauff noted she had actually requested to be scheduled as the second match on\u2011court; for once, she was thankful to the WTA supervisers for not honouring that request.\n\n\u201cSo far, the toughest thing has been not been able to shower after my match. There\u2019s no running water so I just had to take baby wipes and wipe myself, spray some perfume and call it a day,\u201d Gauff said an hour after her match. \u201cI don\u2019t even think we\u2019ll be able to go back to the hotel as the traffic lights are out. So it\u2019s just crazy how much we depend on electricity. It\u2019s really insane. It puts that in perspective and also makes me think about the humans that lived before electricity and how impressive that is.\u201d\n\n1:24 Major power outage causes chaos in Spain and Portugal \u2013 video report\n\nOther players were not quite as fortunate. Grigor Dimitrov, the 15th seed, held a match point against Britain\u2019s Jacob Fearnley at 6-4, 5-2 before serving for the match a game later. By 5-4, the second set back on serve, both players were walking off the court. An hour later, Dimitrov could be found sitting down alone in the sun in a quiet outdoor spot players use to warm up, smiling to himself at such an surreal turn of events.\n\n\u201cAt this point this is only a situation that you can just laugh at if I was on-court because it\u2019s probably not going to happen ever again,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cYou can always remember the day the power went out at the Madrid Open.\u201d\n\nAs much of Madrid came to a standstill, that chaos was reflected inside the Caja M\u00e1gica. Unlike many other tournament sites, the Madrid Open grounds are mostly indoors, below ground level and there is minimal natural light off the court. It meant that much of the grounds were plunged in total darkness. In the communal fan areas, spectators stood shoulder to shoulder, packed like sardines, relying solely on the lights from their phones.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bulgaria\u2019s Grigor Dimitrov had his match with Britain\u2019s Jacob Fearnley interrupted. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe players themselves had things slightly better. Shortly after the outage, workers swept in with candles, with the players\u2019 restaurant and lounge eventually illuminated by dozens of candles. Every hour, the player warm-up area seemed to take on a completely different function. Shortly after the power cut, a number of players due on-court had been warming up in total darkness. An hour later, the room was filled with players simply lying on the floor, on the phone and talking with others. Eventually, as they admitted defeat, numerous massage tables appeared and the players ended their days with physiotherapy.\n\n\u201cI was in the gym and it\u2019s super dark, everyone is using the phones with flashlights, but it\u2019s also kind of fun because everyone is talking to each other and the atmosphere is a little more friendly,\u201d Andreeva said.\n\nIt soon became clear that there would be no more play on this unforgettable day. As players scrambled to secure a lift home, the line at the transport desk extended almost as long as the Wimbledon queue. Their requests were recorded with pen and paper. With traffic lights ceasing to function in the city, a three-hour journey awaited for those who secured a car. Many opted for the one\u2011 to two\u2011hour walk. Once they reached home, this time they would not be able to distract themselves by playing video games, watching TV series or doomscrolling on social media. Not everyone seemed to mind.\n\n\u201cIf you take my phone away, I\u2019m completely fine spending time without it,\u201d said Andreeva, who turns 18 on Tuesday. \u201cThe only thing I need in my phone right now is a flashlight.\u201d",

and there is minimal natural light off the court it meant that much of the grounds were plunged in total darkness in the communal fan areas spectators stood shoulder to shoulder packed like sardines relying solely on the lights from their phones view image in fullscreen bulgaria\u2019s grigor dimitrov had his match with britain\u2019s jacob fearnley interrupted photograph thomas coexafpgetty images the players themselves had things slightly better shortly after the outage workers swept in with candles with the players\u2019 restaurant and lounge eventually illuminated by dozens of candles every hour the player warmup area seemed to take on a completely different function shortly after the power cut a number of players due oncourt had been warming up in total darkness an hour later the room was filled with players simply lying on the floor on the phone and talking with others eventually as they admitted defeat numerous massage tables appeared and the players ended their days with physiotherapy \u201ci was in the gym and it\u2019s super dark everyone is using the phones with flashlights but it\u2019s also kind of fun because everyone is talking to each other and the atmosphere is a little more friendly\u201d andreeva said it soon became clear that there would be no more play on this unforgettable day as players scrambled to secure a lift home the line at the transport desk extended almost as long as the wimbledon queue their requests were recorded with pen and paper with traffic lights ceasing to function in the city a threehour journey awaited for those who secured a car many opted for the one\u2011 to two\u2011hour walk once they reached home this time they would not be able to distract themselves by playing video games watching tv series or doomscrolling on social media not everyone seemed to mind \u201cif you take my phone away i\u2019m completely fine spending time without it\u201d said andreeva who turns 18 on tuesday \u201cthe only thing i need in my

    "title": "\u2018His delivery cut through class barriers\u2019: Moby, Mala and other musicians on working with Benjamin Zephaniah",
    "body": "Tuesday marks the 67th birthday of the late Benjamin Zephaniah \u2013 revolutionary poet, playwright, musician and fearless voice for social justice \u2013 following the inaugural Benjamin Zephaniah Day held over the weekend at Brunel University. But while he is widely celebrated for his work in literature and activism, Zephaniah\u2019s influence on music remains relatively overlooked.\n\nEmerging from the dub poetry scene, Zephaniah channelled personal experiences of systemic racism and state violence into intelligent spoken word. Albums such as Rasta combined politically charged poetry with dub rhythms and studio effects, laying the cultural groundwork for UK genres such as trip-hop, jungle and dubstep. We revisit his unique collaborations in electronic music, hearing from the artists who had the honour of working with him.\n\nNatty x Mala x Benjamin Zephaniah \u2013 Word & Sound (2019)\n\nZephaniah\u2019s Rastafari-inspired wisdom, Natty\u2019s roots-infused minimalism and Mala\u2019s DMZ-era dubstep combine to raise the consciousness vibration in Word & Sound \u2013 an uplifting, intergenerational union years in the making. \u201cBenjamin was like an older brother to me, we were sometimes on the phone for hours,\u201d Natty says. \u201cSo when I asked him to be part of a project I was doing, he wrote his verse immediately.\u201d They recorded at Akala\u2019s Ladbroke Grove studio in London then spent hours listening to Zephaniah\u2019s stories \u2013 including his rightous refusal of an MBE.\n\nNatty says the vocals were meant for the track Badman (Rastafari mix), but when Mala reached out, the dubstep producer was sent them instead. \u201cWorking with such powerful voices was something else,\u201d says Mala. \u201cTheir words guided my creative process. Benjamin\u2019s verse is a reminder to stay true to self and keep growing in heart and spirit. Rest in peace, sir, we salute you.\u201d\n\nNatty continues to include the track in his live sets in memory of his friend. \u201cWhenever we met, we\u2019d sometimes spar, as we both studied martial arts. I remember how strong he was, which made his passing even harder to accept. He was just a down-to-earth, brilliant human being. I\u2019m so grateful to have known and learned from him.\u201d\n\nKofi Stone \u2013 May Sound Crazy (ft Benjamin Zepheniah) (2024)\n\nBorn-and-bred Brummies Kofi Stone and Zephaniah are a force to be reckoned with in this collaboration \u2013 one of Zephaniah\u2019s last, recorded in summer 2023. He steps into the resilient role of mentor in this ambient electronic-infused hip-hop track, as Stone reflects on growing up in Birmingham and navigating poverty and racism. \u201cIt was truly an experience I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d Stone says.\n\nAhead of the recording, Stone met Zephaniah outside the Birmingham Hippodrome, where he was narrating the Peaky Blinders ballet. \u201cBefore the show, we spoke at length about family, music and the state of the world,\u201d recalls Stone. \u201cHe later drove us to the studio and recorded his verse in just a few takes. The whole process was surreal and beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe video to the track was produced months later. \u201cBenjamin was actually quite unwell at the time,\u201d says Stone, \u201cbut he was determined to make the shoot. We filmed his scene on a rooftop car park in Birmingham\u2019s Chinatown.\u201d That was [another] day I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\n\nBomb the Bass \u2013 Empire (with Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor & Benjamin Zephaniah) (1995)\n\nZephaniah joined Bomb the Bass and Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor to deliver a critique of colonialism in this trip-hop-influenced production, imagining a life-sucking vampire as a metaphor for empire. Tim Simenon, AKA Bomb the Bass, says: \u201cI remember smoking a lot of weed with Sin\u00e9ad while recording Empire. She sang the lead vocal in one take, then added harmonies and backing vocals.\u201d\n\nSimenon instinctively knew that Zephaniah\u2019s voice would contrast powerfully. \u201cHe was such a warm, open guy. We spent a long day in the studio, bouncing ideas around until we landed on the spacious delivery we recorded. He gave the final mix an approving head nod \u2013 he was super pleased with the result. We mostly spoke about music, especially dub. We shared a love for Big Youth, Lee \u2018Scratch\u2019 Perry and On-U Sound.\u201d\n\nLB Dub Corp: I Have a Dream (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2013)\n\nI Have a Dream pairs Zephaniah\u2019s cheeky twist on Martin Luther King\u2019s iconic speech with atmospheric dub techno. It\u2019s one of two tracks featuring him on Luke Slater\u2019s LB Dub Corp album Unknown Origin, the other being Take a Ride. \u201cWhen I reached out about combining a track with his poem I Have a Scheme, he was up for it straight away,\u201d Slater says. \u201cWe somehow ended up debating vegan food in China.\u201d\n\nReflecting on their final exchange, Slater said: \u201cBenjamin had just received the album copies I sent and told me he played the track for his students. I was humbled. I miss him in this dimension, but his words live on.\u201d He had intended to ask him to collaborate a second time. \u201cThen a week later he was gone. He left too soon. His words always carried a message \u2013 not always comfortable, never bland. His delivery cut through class barriers and reached people from all walks of life.\u201d\n\nSwayzak \u2013 Illegal (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2000)\n\nThe duo Swayzak captured Zephaniah\u2019s rebellious spirit in this unapologetically anarchic track. \u201cWorking with Benjamin was an unexpected delight,\u201d says James S Taylor. \u201cThere was no ego, no pressure, just good vibes.\u201d The collaboration quickly grew into a friendship. \u201cWe talked deeply about politics and the British empire,\u201d David Brown says. \u201cThe Brummie West Indian poet \u2013 quite a person to have in one\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nA 2024 \u201credraft\u201d of Zephaniah\u2019s 1999 poem Illegal was released under the title Do Something Illegal as a tribute to Zephaniah under Brown\u2019s ambient alias, the Eightsome Reel. The track ends with the sound of heavy rain, recorded the day Brown learned of Zephaniah\u2019s death. \u201cIt hit me hard \u2013 I was in East Kilbride when I heard, a place where he once lived.\u201d\n\nMoby \u2013 Where is Your Pride (ft Benjamin Zephaniah) (2024)\n\nReleased in June 2024 as part of his album, Always Centered at Night, Moby\u2019s Where Is Your Pride? is a tribute to Zephaniah. He says: \u201cAs a vegan activist and as a wise and compassionate man, Benjamin inspired me for many years. I hope Where Is Your Pride? honours his legacy and also draws people\u2019s attention to his life, work and principles.\u201d",

    "title": "Six-way title tilts and angry Bulls: non-league stories you may have missed",
    "body": "Bury break a record\n\nSix years after Bury were expelled from the Football League, last weekend they smashed a North West Counties League record by attracting a crowd of 8,719 to Gigg Lane as they sealed the first promotion since they were reborn by thrashing Burscough 4-0, a 15th successive victory. A measure of this achievement: the previous record crowd, the 6,023 who watched FC United of Manchester lose 1-0 to Great Harwood Town, was set in April 2006 (the 5,834 that saw Bury draw 2-2 with Ramsbottom United on Boxing Day sits at No 3 on the list); only one team in non\u2011league football, Southend in the division above the division above the division above the division above them, have had more people at a game this season; Bury\u2019s average attendance in the ninth tier of English football, 3,315, is bigger than that of five teams in League Two and one in League One, as well as seven in the Portuguese top flight; that record attendance was 2.7 times larger than the total attendance at the other 11 games played in their division on the final day.\n\nA couple of other familiar names with big fanbases also hope to end the season with a celebration: Scunthorpe United, with the fourth-biggest average attendance in non-league football, are two points behind Kidderminster Harriers and Brackley Town in the hunt for a single automatic promotion spot in National League North (though Brackley are at home to rock-bottom Farsley Celtic, who are on a run even sillier than Bury\u2019s, having lost their past 17 league games), and Torquay, fifth in the attendance table, are in National League South\u2019s wild shake-up.\n\nSix-way title tussle\n\nThe final day dawns for National League South with fully 25% of its teams capable of winning it. Truro City go into it above Torquay at the top because their goal difference is better by two (they have scored one more goal), Eastbourne Borough and Worthing are a further point back, and Boreham Wood and Dorking Wanderers are two behind them (with the division\u2019s best and second-best goal difference respectively). Disappointingly none of the teams play any of the others on the last day, with the pick of the fixtures Truro\u2019s against St Albans City, who need to do better than Salisbury (the two are level on points but Salisbury\u2019s goal difference is better by one) to stay up. A few weeks ago it looked as if the title was Worthing\u2019s to win: on 15 March they had won their past five, led the league by four and had a game in hand on every other side in the top 10. \u201cWe\u2019re very hard to play against at the moment and I think we\u2019re improving, we\u2019re getting better,\u201d their manager, Chris Agutter, said after they beat Hemel Hempstead Town that day. \u201cWe\u2019re becoming more ruthless as well. We just need to keep working hard, and the results touch wood should keep going in the right direction.\u201d Since then: two wins, two draws, three defeats.

That dream is not over. We have achieved so much in such a short space of time that we must not let an error, a technicality, and a decision that is out of our hands divide us.\u201d For most of the final afternoon Whyteleafe, who led Fleet Town from the 12th minute, were going up, only for Redhill to score a 93rd-minute winner and pip them, but still the identity of the champions is unknown. The Bulls, who also won on the final day, have submitted an appeal, saying there is \u201csignificant mitigation\u201d concerning a \u201clack of clarity on the number of yellow cards\u201d (the situation does, to be fair, sound a bit confusing: after the player picked up his 10th booking of the season he was left out for two games before returning to the team. But it turned out that one of those 10 bookings didn\u2019t count because it came in the FA Vase, which meant he was not officially suspended until after his next one, his first after the club thought he had been suspended). The league is investigating and the playoffs \u2013 due to get under way on Saturday \u2013 have been postponed.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the club\u2019s third league title in the three years since they were bought by the Bedfordian, podcaster and crypto enthusiast Peter McCormack, who declared at the time that the purchase was \u201cpart of a childhood dream to own a local Bedford club\u201d and: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to bring league football to the town \u2026 I am a Bitcoiner, we aim big.\u201d A \u00a33.5m investment from the Olympic rowers and crypto traders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, announced last year, was finalised in February, and in the first match the now co-owners attended the team beat Kings Langley 1-0 to seal promotion (on the same day Real Bedford Women beat London Seaward 11-1 to win their own second successive league title).

Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nA goal difference of -152\n\nSpare a thought for Welton Rovers of the Western League Premier Division (but not for long), who ended with four points from 38 matches, one win and a goal difference of -152. That win was a rip-roaring 7-4 victory over St Blazey in February which ended their worst period of the season, four games which they lost by an aggregate score of 32-1. If you think you could do better, they advertised for a new first-team manager on Monday. Also spare a thought for Sittingbourne, who became only the second Isthmian South East team since 2018 (when there were two more of them, so four extra games) to reach 100 points but still won\u2019t be rewarded with automatic promotion. That\u2019s because the first, Ramsgate, also did it this year, and are on 108. They play each other on Saturday.",

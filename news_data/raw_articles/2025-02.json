    "body": "Central Cee makes history at Mobo Awards\n\n18 February 2025 Share Save Riyah Collins BBC Newsbeat Share Save\n\nGetty Images Central Cee is the first artist to win best male act at the Mobos three times\n\nCentral Cee has made history at the Mobo Awards, becoming the first artist to be named best male act three times. It was his seventh trophy, matching Stormzy's record as the most decorated rapper in the awards' history. He did not attend the ceremony in person, with his prize instead collected by host Eddie Kadi who joked they \"share everything... except royalties\". The event in Newcastle also saw Bashy claim best album and best hip-hop act after a 15-year break from music and Darkoo beat off competition from Raye and Jorja Smith to be recognised as best female act.\n\nAccepting her award, Darkoo said she \"tried Chat GPT\" to write her speech \"but I didn't know how to make it work\", so instead freestyled and thanked her family for supporting her. \"It's been a rollercoaster but they believed in me for the past year and I've been shutting it down.\"\n\nPA Media Darkoo also performed at the event, treating the audience to the song of the year - Favourite Girl\n\nCentral Cee, also known as Cench, was previously named best male act in 2024 and released his debut album last month after eight top 10 singles. Reacting to his win on Instagram, he posted a screenshot of the awards' coverage with the comment \"that's nice\". He missed out on his other two nominations including best drill act, which went to Pozer, and song of the year which was won by Darkoo alongside her trophy for best female act. Despite not making breaking into the UK singles charts, the British-Nigerian artist won for Favourite Girl, a collab with Dess Dior, ahead of Stormzy's number one track with Chase & Status, Backbone, as well as Central Cee's collab with Lil Baby, Band4Band, which peaked at number three.\n\nGetty Images Ayra Starr made history as the first African woman to win best international act\n\nAyra Starr also scooped two awards, making history as the first African woman to win best international act and becoming the first woman to win best African music act in 16 years. Jamaican dancehall artist Vybz Kartel was also recognised with the Mobo impact award. He was released from jail last year after his murder conviction was overturned and at the weekend was confirmed to be performing at this summer's Wireless festival. \"Think about this, got locked up, did 13 years in prison,\" he said while accepting his accolade. \"Meanwhile I'm diagnosed with Graves' disease so I'm fighting to be free, I'm fighting my illness, I'm fighting to keep my family together, I'm fighting to keep the fans pleased. \"And now I'm here, I walked the red carpet at the Mobo's. That taught me to believe in three things now more than ever: fate, change and forgiveness.\"\n\nGetty Images Vybz Kartel attended the awards where he was honoured with the Mobo impact award\n\nThe ceremony saw performances from Nova Twins, Spice, Krept And Konan and award winners Odeal, Darkoo and Bashy. Bashy, who returned to music after a 15-year break to focus on his acting career, won best hip-hop act as well as album of the year for Being Poor Is Expensive - an award he said he \"wanted and deserved\". \"This has been a 20-year plus journey, it's been hard work, tenacity, a lot of ups and downs. \"I stood in my truth, stood in my community's truth and now I'm here,\" he said on stage, making a point to thank the Windrush generation. \"I'm just a regular guy from the ends. I was a bus driver, I was a postman, I worked in retail. So if you're out there and you're working a job to fund your passion, don't be ashamed of your job. \"This is an amazing honour, I'm humbled.\"\n\nGetty Images Bashy, real name Ashley Thomas, won two awards on his comeback to music after a 15-year break\n\nIt was the first awards since Mobos founder Kanya King revealed she'd been diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer. Labour MP Dawn Butler became emotional as she announced Kanya would receive a surprise award, paving the way, which was also won by athlete and broadcaster Denise Lewis. Kanya came on stage to a standing ovation from the crowd, saying she felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude \"because there was a time I thought I wouldn't make it\". \"Next year marks our 30th anniversary and I very much intend to be there.\"\n\nPA Media Kanya said her diagnosis was \"a chance to inspire resilience and raise awareness\"\n\nThe winners in full: Best male act - Central Cee\n\nBest female act - Darkoo\n\nBest newcomer - Odeal\n\nAlbum of the year - Bashy, Being Poor Is Expensive\n\nSong of the year - Darkoo feat.

Kathleen and Asa Harrison adopted Flora, the offspring of a feral cat, when she was a kitten. She quickly settled into life in Strond, Harris, with the Harrisons' dogs Cooper and Mist. Flora vanished in March 2020 and Kathleen feared she was gone for good until she turned up last month - 11 miles away in Miabhag nam B\u00e0gh.\n\nAsa and Kathleen Harrison hope to find out where Flora has been for the last five years\n\nFlora shares her home with two dogs and two new cats\n\nAfter her travels, the wandering moggy now has the nickname Flora the Explorer, which plays on the name of children's TV cartoon character Dora the Explorer. When she disappeared, the Harrisons initially thought she had jumped into the van of contractors who had been working on their house at the time. But checks of the vehicle and Scaladale, North Harris, where the workers made a stop before returning to Stornoway in Lewis found no sign of her. The couple spent days searching their local area and, over the years, Kathleen has received multiple messages about possible sightings but none turned out to be Flora. On 13 January she was contacted by a cousin about a social media post with an image attached of a cat found in Miabhag nam B\u00e0gh. Kathleen said: \"I looked at the post and it was the first time in all those years that I thought it could be Flora.\"\n\nArriving at the house of the person who found the cat, Kathleen called out Flora's name and the cat ran up to her. A scan of the cat's microchip confirmed it was her. Kathleen said: \"We just couldn't believe it was her. It took a while to sink in. \"She was well looked after by the family that found her.\" Kathleen added: \"The dogs went crazy, in a positive way. \"Mist almost climbed into the cat carrier with her. We think they absolutely recognised her straight away. \"From that moment, it was obvious to us that she's just so happy to be home. \"She's made it.\"\n\nFlora is settling back into life in Strond",

    "title": "Audiologists raise concern over headphone use in young people",
    "body": "Are noise-cancelling headphones to blame for young people's hearing problems?\n\n16 February 2025 Share Save Hannah Karpel BBC News, health reporter Share Save\n\nBBC Sophie says her anxiety peaks if she is in a loud environment and not wearing her headphones to limit the noise\n\nWhether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day. But, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts. This is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\". \"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said. After a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words. Her audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones.\n\n'Words sound like gibberish'\n\nHaving grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from. She rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. \"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said. It affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".\n\nGetty Images Classrooms can echo sound and be full of noises like clicking pens, typing and whispering which make listening to a teacher difficult for people with auditory processing disorder\n\nThe cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play. Other audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use. Five NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling. APD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\n\nHearing vs listening\n\nRenee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on. Her team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\" Noise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music. Lisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model. \"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.\n\nA false reality?\n\nBut Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise. \"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said. \"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests. For those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited. A UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD. And, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long. Prof Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\" Particularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown.\n\nGetty Images Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children have seen an increase in demand for assessments of children struggling to hear certain words in noisy environments\n\nIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on. Dr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children. \"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\" Dr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research. He said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".\n\nTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery. So-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three. Microphones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS. \"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis. \"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\" To improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.\n\nLimited research",

But the value of the coin had a significant price drop of up to 90%, according to specialist websites.\n\nMeme-coins are used to build popularity for a viral internet trend or movement and fans are inspired to collect and give them value, but they are extremely volatile investments.\n\nCentral African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra has launched a meme-coin in a bid to raise the profile of the country, which is one of the world's poorest.\n\nThat initiative - launched under the name Sango - does not appear to have been as successful as planned, and its website no longer works.\n\nIt was seen as an easier way to attract investors to the country's mining and other industries using Bitcoin. The country has rich mineral deposits, including gold and diamonds.\n\nForeign investors could also obtain citizenship for $60,000 worth of crypto, although the plan was later ruled unconstitutional by the country's top court.\n\nTouad\u00e9ra described this week's launch of the meme-coin as an \"experiment\" of something that \"can unite people, support national development, and put the [country] on the world stage in a unique way\".\n\nBut some expressed fears that it could have been a scam.\n\nOn Monday, Touad\u00e9ra thanked those who believed in his vision.\n\nHe shared a video of a high school which he said had been deteriorating rapidly, saying the meme-coin would help support its \"rebuilding and furnishing\" and give \"students a chance for a better future\".\n\nDespite its potential, CAR remains one of the poorest countries - a situation complicated by a civil war which has devastated much of the country.\n\nMeme-coins have often been criticised for their speculative nature, where users create or buy them in the hope that their value will rise and make money quickly - but many end up losing money on them.\n\nJust before his inauguration last month, US President Donald Trump launched his own meme-coin whose value quickly soared, and which reportedly raised billions of dollars for him. The New York Times has reported that it is now worth a quarter of its highest value.",

    "title": "Chris Mason: UK immigration has seen a trend over the last 30 years",
    "body": "Why Labour aims to buck 25-year trend of rising legal migration\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Chris Mason \u2022 @ChrisMasonBBC Political editor Share Save\n\nIn Pictures via Getty Images Images\n\nImmigration into the UK is, arguably, the standout social and demographic change of the 21st Century and also one of the biggest and most transparent political failings, when you compare rhetoric to reality. Whatever your own view about immigration, the trends over the last generation are worth a look. For the last 30 years, the number of people migrating to the UK has been greater than the number emigrating, every single year. In the 30 years before the mid 1990s, net migration, the number arriving minus the number leaving, bobbed up and down but was broadly balanced. In other words, net migration was zero. But from 1994 onwards, it began to climb, jumping during Labour's time in office in the early 2000s \u2013 and doing so by more than they publicly estimated when the EU expanded and the UK didn't impose any limits on those who could move here. By the time the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government came to power in 2010, it had become a sufficiently potent political issue that the Tories promised to \"take steps to take net migration back to the levels of the 1990s \u2013 tens of thousands a year, not hundreds of thousands\".\n\nThey failed. \"Over the last 25 years, both immigration and emigration have increased to historically high levels, with immigration exceeding emigration by more than 100,000 in every year between 1998 and 2020,\" a research paper from the House of Commons Library notes. In other words, the numbers remained historically high. Immigration became a key issue for many in the EU referendum in 2016. Brexit, once it was eventually delivered, meant political leaders could no longer blame anyone else for immigration. Freedom of movement with EU member states ended. The government at Westminster would have all the levers necessary, if they were willing to use them, to control who was allowed to come to the UK. In 2021, a new immigration policy was set out. There were changes to the criteria needed for work visas, in what was widely described as a points based system. The net migration figures shot up, despite the demands of many, expressed at the time of the EU referendum. for the opposite to happen. In the year to June 2023, net migration was 906,000. In the year to June 2024, it was 728,000. A week on Thursday, the latest data will be published. It will likely show a significant fall in the calendar year 2024, as we already know there was a dramatic fall in visas granted last year.\n\nAll of this is the context for what we are seeing the government now set out. Before the week is out, expect to hear more from ministers about illegal immigration. For now the focus is on legal immigration. Both fall within what senior figures see as one of their three pillars, a trio of priorities: secure borders \u2013 alongside the health service and more money in people's pockets. The current net migration numbers are \"beyond unsustainable\", one senior government figure told me. Put simply, there is a political imperative to get the numbers down and they hope they have found a way to do it that helps people feel better off, rather than having a negative economic impact. So expect, for instance, that the most prized immigrants \u2013 the most highly skilled and the most high earning \u2013 will be able to secure permanent residence much quicker than others. The White Paper is the work of the last six or seven months. Ministers hope to deliver some things quickly \u2013 cutting by 50,000 the number of lower skilled and care workers coming to the UK pretty much straight away. Other plans are expected to be set out in an immigration bill at the next King's Speech. The aim is that by the time the next general election is close, in 2028 or 2029, the prime minister can point to a trend which bucks what we have seen so far this century. His credibility, and that of the Conservatives, Reform UK and others will be shaped by how successful or otherwise he is.",

    "body": "Ex-UK Special Forces break silence on 'war crimes' by colleagues\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Hannah O'Grady, Joel Gunter & Rory Tinman BBC Panorama Share Save\n\nA video compiled by UK Special Forces shows how members of one squadron kept count of their kills\n\nFormer members of UK Special Forces have broken years of silence to give BBC Panorama eyewitness accounts of alleged war crimes committed by colleagues in Iraq and Afghanistan. Giving their accounts publicly for the first time, the veterans described seeing members of the SAS murder unarmed people in their sleep and execute handcuffed detainees, including children. \"They handcuffed a young boy and shot him,\" recalled one veteran who served with the SAS in Afghanistan. \"He was clearly a child, not even close to fighting age.\" Killing of detainees \"became routine\", the veteran said. \"They'd search someone, handcuff them, then shoot them\", before cutting off the plastic handcuffs used to restrain people and \"planting a pistol\" by the body, he said. The new testimony includes allegations of war crimes stretching over more than a decade, far longer than the three years currently being examined by a judge-led public inquiry in the UK. The SBS, the Royal Navy's elite special forces regiment, is also implicated for the first time in the most serious allegations - executions of unarmed and wounded people. A veteran who served with the SBS said some troops had a \"mob mentality\", describing their behaviour on operations as \"barbaric\". \"I saw the quietest guys switch, show serious psychopathic traits,\" he said. \"They were lawless. They felt untouchable.\" Special Forces were deployed to Afghanistan to protect British troops from Taliban fighters and bombmakers. The conflict was a deadly one for members of the UK's armed forces \u2013 457 lost their lives and thousands more were wounded. Asked by the BBC about the new eyewitness testimony, the Ministry of Defence said that it was \"fully committed\" to supporting the ongoing public inquiry into the alleged war crimes and that it urged all veterans with relevant information to come forward. It said that it was \"not appropriate for the MoD to comment on allegations\" which may be in the inquiry's scope.\n\n'Psychotic murderers' in the regiment\n\nThe eyewitness testimony offers the most detailed public account of the killings to date from former members of UK Special Forces (UKSF), the umbrella group which contains the SAS, SBS and several supporting regiments. The testimony, from more than 30 people who served with or alongside UK Special Forces, builds on years of reporting by BBC Panorama into allegations of extrajudicial killings by the SAS. Panorama can also reveal for the first time that then Prime Minister David Cameron was repeatedly warned during his tenure that UK Special Forces were killing civilians in Afghanistan. Speaking on condition of anonymity because of a de facto code of silence around special forces operations, the eyewitnesses told the BBC that the laws of war were being regularly and intentionally broken by the country's most elite regiments during operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Those laws state that on such operations people can be deliberately killed only when they pose a direct threat to the lives of British troops or others. But members of the SAS and SBS were making their own rules, the eyewitnesses said. \"If a target had popped up on the list two or three times before, then we'd go in with the intention of killing them, there was no attempt to capture them,\" said one veteran who served with the SAS, referring to people who had been previously captured, questioned and then released. \"Sometimes we'd check we'd identified the target, confirm their ID, then shoot them,\" he said. \"Often the squadron would just go and kill all the men they found there.\" One witness who served with the SAS said that killing could become \"an addictive thing to do\" and that some members of the elite regiment were \"intoxicated by that feeling\" in Afghanistan. There were \"lots of psychotic murderers\", he said.\n\nGetty Images Then Prime Minister David Cameron (r) was made aware, by the then Afghan President Hamid Karzai (l), of allegations of civilian killings, the BBC has been told\n\n\"On some operations, the troop would go into guesthouse-type buildings and kill everyone there,\" he said. \"They'd go in and shoot everyone sleeping there, on entry. It's not justified, killing people in their sleep.\" A veteran who served with the SBS told the BBC that after bringing an area under control, assault teams would sweep through the area shooting anyone on the ground, checking the bodies and killing anyone left alive. \"It was expected, not hidden. Everyone knew,\" he said. Intentionally killing wounded people who do not pose a threat would be a clear breach of international law. But the SBS veteran told Panorama that wounded people were routinely killed. He described one operation during which a medic was treating someone who had been shot but was still breathing. \"Then one of our blokes came up to him. There was a bang. He'd been shot in the head at point-blank range,\" he said. The killings were \"completely unnecessary,\" he added. \"These are not mercy killings. It's murder.\"\n\nMore junior members of assault teams were told by more senior SAS operators to kill male detainees, according to the testimony, using instructions such as \"he's not coming back to base with us\" or \"this detainee, you make sure he doesn't come off target\". Detainees were people who had surrendered, been searched by special forces, and were typically handcuffed. British and international law forbid troops from deliberately killing unarmed civilians or prisoners of war. A former SAS operator also described learning of an operation in Iraq during which someone was executed. \"It was pretty clear from what I could glean that he posed no threat, he wasn't armed. It's disgraceful. There's no professionalism in that,\" the former operator said. The killing was never properly investigated, he added. According to the SAS veteran, the problem started long before the regiment moved across to Afghanistan and \"senior commanders were aware of that\".\n\nOne SAS veteran said that killing could be an \"addictive thing to do\"\n\nThe testimony, as well as new video evidence obtained by the BBC from SAS operations in Iraq in 2006, also supports previous reporting by Panorama that SAS squadrons kept count of their kills to compete with one another. Sources told the BBC that some members of the SAS kept their own individual counts, and that one operator personally killed dozens of people on one six-month tour of Afghanistan. \"It seemed like he was trying to get a kill on every operation, every night someone got killed,\" a former colleague said. The operator was \"notorious in the squadron, he genuinely seemed like a psychopath,\" the former colleague added. In one incident that sources say became infamous inside the SAS, the operator allegedly slit the throat of an injured Afghan man after telling an officer not to shoot the man again. It was \"because he wanted to go and finish the wounded guy off with his knife,\" another former colleague said. \"He wanted to, you know, blood his knife.\" Knowledge of the alleged crimes was not confined to small teams or individual squadrons, according to the testimony. Within the UK Special Forces command structure, \"everyone knew\" what was happening, said one veteran. \"I'm not taking away from personal responsibility, but everyone knew,\" he said. \"There was implicit approval for what was happening.\" To avoid scrutiny of the killings, eyewitnesses said, members of the SAS and SBS would plant so-called \"drop weapons\" on the bodies of the dead, to make it look as though they had been armed in the photographs routinely taken by special forces teams at the scene. \"There was a fake grenade they'd take with them onto target, it couldn't detonate,\" said a former SAS operator. Another veteran said operators would carry AK-47 rifles which had a folding stock because they were easier to fit into their rucksacks and \"easier to bring onto a target and plant by a body\".\n\nReports were 'fiction'\n\nOfficers would then help to falsify post-operational reports in order to avoid scrutiny for the actions of assault teams on the ground, according to the testimony. \"We understood how to write up serious incident reviews so they wouldn't trigger a referral to the military police,\" one of the veterans said. \"If it looked like a shooting could represent a breach of the rules of conflict, you'd get a phone call from the legal adviser or one of the staff officers in HQ. They'd pick you up on it and help you to clarify the language. 'Do you remember someone making a sudden move?' 'Oh yeah, I do now.' That sort of thing. It was built into the way we operated.\" The reports were \"a fiction\", another UKSF veteran said. An intelligence officer who worked with the SBS described reports which said they had been caught in a firefight, while the photos showed bodies with \"multiple clean headshots\". Falsified paperwork could help prevent an investigation by the Royal Military Police, but British special forces operations generated deep concern from Afghan commanders and Afghan government officials. David Cameron - who made seven visits to Afghanistan as prime minister between June 2010 and November 2013, the period now under scrutiny by the SAS public inquiry, was repeatedly made aware of the concerns by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, according to multiple people who attended the meetings. Mr Karzai \"consistently, repeatedly mentioned this issue\", former Afghan national security adviser Dr Rangin Dadfar Spanta told Panorama. He said Lord Cameron could have been left in no doubt that there were allegations of civilians, including children, being killed during operations carried out by UK Special Forces.\n\nFormer director of service prosecutions Bruce Houlder said he hoped the inquiry would examine what Mr Cameron knew\n\nThe Afghan president was \"so consistent with his complaints about night raids, civilian casualties and detentions that there was no senior Western diplomat or military leader who would have missed the fact that this was a major irritant for him,\" said Gen Douglas Lute, a former US ambassador to Nato. Gen Lute said it would have been \"extraordinarily unusual if there were a claim against British forces that the British chain of command was not aware of\". A spokesperson for Lord Cameron told Panorama that \"to the best of Lord Cameron's recollection\" the issues raised by President Karzai were about Nato forces in general and that \"specific incidents with respect to UK Special Forces were not raised\". The spokesperson also said that it was \"right that we await the official findings of the Inquiry\", adding that \"any suggestion that Lord Cameron colluded in covering up allegations of serious criminal wrongdoing is total nonsense.\" Unlike many other countries, including the US and France, the UK has no parliamentary oversight of its elite special forces regiments. Strategic responsibility for their actions falls ultimately to the prime minister, along with the defence secretary and head of special forces. Bruce Houlder KC - a former director of service prosecutions, responsible for bringing charges and prosecuting those serving in the Armed Forces - told Panorama that he hoped the public inquiry would examine the extent of Lord Cameron's knowledge of alleged civilian casualties on British special forces operations. \"You need to know how far the rot went up,\" Mr Houlder said.",

    "body": "White House and Qatar discuss transfer of luxury jet for Air Force One\n\nThe government-owned Qatar Amiri Flight company's Boeing 747-8Z5 is similar to one said to be in discussions to be transferred to US President Donald Trump\n\nThe news comes as Trump is set to visit Qatar this week as part of the first major foreign trip of his second term.\n\nAccording to CBS News, the BBC's news partner in America, the plane would be donated to Trump's presidential library at the end of his term.\n\nIn a statement, Qatar denied that the plane would be a gift, but said the transfer of an aircraft for \"temporary use\" was under discussion between the two countries.\n\nThe White House is in discussions with the royal family of Qatar to possibly receive a luxury jumbo jet, intended for use as an Air Force One presidential plane.\n\nAli Al-Ansari, Qatar's Media Attach\u00e9 to the US, said negotiations were ongoing between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense.\n\n\"The matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made.\"\n\nSources told CBS News that the plane will not be ready for use right away as it will need to retrofitted and cleared by security officials.\n\nThe potential value of the plane and its handling is sure to raise legal and ethical questions among critics.\n\nOn Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said \"any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. President Trump's Administration is committed to full transparency\".\n\nDefending the negotiations with Qatar, Trump referred to the plane as a gift and said it was offered for his use at no cost in a post to his Truth Social website on Sunday.\n\n\"So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane.\" he wrote.\n\nThe White House's current fleet includes two Boeing 747-200B planes customised for presidential use with special communications equipment and features like a stateroom, office and conference room, according to the US Air Force. The planes have been in use since 1990 and 1991.\n\nAir Force One planes usually carry over to other administrations. According to the National Archives, only the Reagan presidential library has an Air Force One jet, and it flew seven presidents before being donated.\n\nQatar is said to be offering a version of a Boeing 747-8, a much newer model that ABC News reports has been upgraded into a \"flying palace\".\n\nBoeing had been contracted to provide the White House with newer planes, but Trump complained earlier this year that the company was behind schedule. His administration had initially negotiated with Boeing for two specialised 747-8 planes during his first administration.\n\nThe plane maker said the aircraft would not be available until 2027 or 2028.\n\n\"No, I'm not happy with Boeing. It takes them a long time to do, you know, Air Force One, we gave that contract out a long time ago,\" Trump said in February.\n\n\"We may buy a plane or get a plane, or something.\"\n\nTrump had a positive diplomatic relationship with Qatar during his first term, which included an announcement in 2019 that the country would make a large purchase of American airplanes.\n\nQatar has also previously given private jets as gifts to other countries, such as a luxury plane given to Turkey in 2018.",

    "body": "Weight-loss drugs tested in head-to-head trial\n\n9 hours ago Share Save James Gallagher \u2022 @JamesTGallagher Health and science correspondent Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe first head-to-head trial of two blockbuster weight-loss drugs has shown Mounjaro is more effective than rival Wegovy. Both drugs led to substantial weight loss, but Mounjaro's 20% weight reduction, after 72 weeks of treatment, exceeded the 14% from Wegovy, according to the trial's findings. Researchers who led the trial said both drugs had a role, but Mounjaro may help those with the most weight to lose. Both drugs trick the brain into making you feel full so you eat less and instead burn fat stored in the body - but subtle differences in how they work to explain the difference in effectiveness.\n\nWegovy, also known as semaglutide, mimics a hormone released by the body after a meal to flip one appetite switch in the brain. Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, flips two. The trial, which was paid for by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Mounjaro, involved 750 obese people, with an average weight of 113kg (nearly 18 stone). They were asked to take the highest dose they could tolerate of one of the two drugs. The findings, presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Malaga and in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed: 32% of people lost a quarter of their body weight on Mounjaro compared to 16% on Wegovy\n\nThose on Mounjaro lost an average of 18cm from their waistlines compared with 13cm on Wegovy.\n\nThose on Mounjaro had better blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.\n\nBoth had similar levels of side-effects.\n\nWomen tended to lose more weight than men. Dr Louis Aronne, who conducted the trial at the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, said: \"The majority of people with obesity will do just fine with semaglutide (Wegovy), those at the higher end may ultimately do better with tirzepatide (Mounjaro).\"\n\nPrivate tirzepatide sales 'well ahead of semaglutide'\n\nIn the UK, the two medicines are available from specialist weight-management services, but can also be bought privately. Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said the drugs were \"good options\" for patients, but while \"many will be satisfied with 15% weight loss\u2026 many want as much weight loss as possible\". \"In the UK, tirzepatide sales privately are now well ahead of semaglutide \u2013 that's just a reality - and this paper will accelerate that I imagine,\" he added. However, Wegovy is also licensed for other conditions \u2013 such as preventing heart attacks \u2013 while the equivalent trials with Mounjaro have not been completed.\n\nA huge amount of research into weight-loss drugs is still taking place. Higher doses of current drugs are being tested, as are new ways of taking them such as oral pills and new medicines that act on the body in different ways are being investigated. It means the final winner in this field has yet to be determined. Prof Sattar says the amount of research taking place means we may be approaching the point where \"obesity prevention may also be possible soon\", but argues \"it would be far better\" to make our society healthier to prevent more people developing obesity.",

    "title": "Spoan disease: Rare condition in Brazil town popular for cousin marriage",
    "body": "The rare disease in a remote town where 'almost everyone is a cousin'\n\n10 hours ago Share Save Giulia Granchi and Vitor Tavares BBC Brasil reporters sent to Serrinha dos Pintos Share Save\n\nMariana Casti\u00f1eiras/Caroline Souza Affected families in Serrinha dos Pintos lived without a diagnosis until geneticist Silvana Santos arrived\n\nBefore Silvana Santos arrived in the little town of Serrinha dos Pintos more than 20 years ago, residents had no idea why so many local children had lost the ability to walk. The remote town in north-eastern Brazil is home to fewer than 5,000 people, and is where biologist and geneticist Santos identified and named a previously unknown condition: Spoan syndrome. Caused by a genetic mutation, the syndrome affects the nervous system, gradually weakening the body. It only appears when the altered gene is inherited from both parents. Santos's research marked the first time the disease had been described anywhere in the world. For this and later work, she was named one of the BBC's 100 most influential women in 2024. Before Santos arrived, families had no explanation for the illness affecting their children. Today, residents talk confidently about Spoan and genetics. \"She gave us a diagnosis we never had. After the research, help came: people, funding, wheelchairs,\" says Marquinhos, one of the patients.\n\nSerrinha dos Pintos: a world of its own\n\nWhere Santos is from in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil's largest and wealthiest city, many of her neighbours were members of the same extended family originally from Serrinha. Many of them were cousins of varying degrees, married to each other. They told Santos that many of people in their hometown couldn't walk, but that no-one knew why. One of the neighbours' daughters, Zirl\u00e2ndia, suffered from a debilitating condition: as a child, her eyes moved involuntarily and over time, she lost strength in her limbs and needed to use a wheelchair, requiring help with even the simplest tasks. Years of investigation would lead Santos and a research team to identify these as symptoms of Spoan syndrome. They would go on to find 82 other cases worldwide.\n\nMariana Casti\u00f1eiras/BBC The entrance of Serrinha dos Pintos, where research suggests nearly a third of couples are related\n\nAt the invitation of her neighbours, Santos visited Serrinha on holiday. She describes her arrival as stepping into \"a world of its own\" - not just because of the lush scenery and mountain views, but also due to what seemed to be a notable social coincidence. The more she walked and spoke with locals, the more surprised she was at how common marriages between cousins were. Serrinha's geographical isolation and little inward migration mean that many of the population are related, making marriage between cousins far more likely and more socially acceptable. Worldwide, marriages between relatives were estimated at around 10% in the early 2010s. More recent data shows the rate varies widely, from over 50% in countries like Pakistan, to 1-4% in Brazil and less than 1% in the US and Russia. Most children born to pairs of cousins are healthy, experts say. But these marriages do face a higher risk of a harmful genetic mutation being passed down through the family. \"If a couple is unrelated, the chance of having a child with a rare genetic disorder or disability is about 2\u20133%. For cousins, the risk rises to 5\u20136% per pregnancy,\" explains geneticist Luzivan Costa Reis from Brazil's Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. A 2010 study led by Santos showed that more than 30% of couples in Serrinha were related, and a third of them had at least one child with a disability.\n\nLong road to diagnosis\n\nSantos set out to find a diagnosis for the people of Serrinha and she began planning a detailed genetic study, requiring multiple trips and eventually leading to her relocating to the region. She drove the 1,250 miles (2,000km) to and from S\u00e3o Paulo many times in the early years of her research. She collected DNA samples door-to-door, chatting to locals over coffee and gathering family stories, all the while trying to locate the mutation causing the disease. What was supposed to be three months of fieldwork turned into years of dedication. It all led to the publication in 2005 of the team's study revealing the existence of Spoan in the Brazilian hinterland. Santos's team found that the mutation involves the loss of a small fragment of a chromosome, which causes a gene to overproduce a key protein in brain cells.\n\n\"They said it came from Maximiano, a womaniser in our family,\" recalls farmer Lol\u00f4, whose daughter Rejane has Spoan. Lol\u00f4, now 83, married his cousin and never left Serrinha. He still tends cattle and relies on family to care for Rejane, who struggles with daily tasks. But the genetic mutation behind Spoan is far older than the legend of Old Maximiano: it likely arrived more than 500 years ago with early European settlers in the north-east of Brazil. \"Sequencing studies show strong European ancestry in patients, supporting records of Portuguese, Dutch, and Sephardic Jewish presence in the region,\" says Santos. The theory gained strength after two Spoan cases were found in Egypt, and further studies showed that the Egyptian cases also shared European ancestry, pointing to a common origin in the Iberian Peninsula. \"It likely came with related Sephardic Jews or Moors fleeing the Inquisition,\" says Santos. She believes more cases may exist globally, especially in Portugal.\n\nMariana Casti\u00f1eiras/BBC Silvana Santos no longer lives in the area, but she continues to visit\n\nUnderstanding the risks\n\nAlthough there's been little progress toward a cure, tracking patients has brought some change. Rejane recalls how people used to be called \"cripples\". Now, they're simply said to have Spoan. Wheelchairs brought not just independence, but also helped prevent deformities - in the past, many with the condition had been left simply lying in bed or on the floor. As Spoan progresses, physical limitations worsen with age and by 50, nearly all patients become fully dependent on carers. This is the case for In\u00e9s's children, who are among the oldest in Serrinha. Chiquinho, 59, can no longer speak, and Marquinhos, 46, has limited communication abilities. \"It's hard to have a 'special' child. We love them the same, but we suffer for them,\" says In\u00e9s, who is married to a second cousin.\n\nMariana Casti\u00f1eiras/BBC In\u00eas has two sons affected by Spoan Syndrome\n\nLarissa Queiroz, 25, the niece of Chiquinho and Marquinho, also married a distant relative. She and her husband, Saulo, only discovered their common ancestor after several months of dating. \"In Serrinha dos Pintos, deep down, we're all cousins. We're related to everyone,\" she says. Couples like Larissa and Saulo are the focus of a new research project which Santos is also involved in. Backed by Brazil's Ministry of Health, it will screen 5,000 couples for genes linked to serious recessive diseases.\n\nMariana Casti\u00f1eiras/BBC Thanks to research in occupational therapy, Paula and several other patients have already received motorised wheelchairs",

But it has since moved away from its separatist goals, focusing instead on more autonomy and greater Kurdish rights.\n\nThe move followed a call in February by the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for the organisation to disband.

    "body": "Baftas 2025: A wedding dress, party plans and Alan Cumming's four suits\n\n8 hours ago Share Save Emma Saunders Culture reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nIt is trailed as the biggest night in the UK's TV calendar and the 2025 Bafta TV Awards didn't disappoint. We were on the red carpet before heading backstage to get all the gossip from the winners, grabbing some of the big moments you might have missed. So whether Gavin & Stacey floats your boat or Baby Reindeer is more your thing, read on!\n\nStacey Solomon wore her wedding dress\n\nThe Sort Your Life Out star was nominated for two Baftas this year and rocked up on the red carpet in a new version of the wedding dress she wore to marry Joe Swash in 2022. \"I decided to have my wedding dress reworked today because wearing it once feels like a travesty,\" she told her Instagram followers. We agree! And it was very in keeping with Stacey's upcycling hacks that she likes to share.\n\nAlan Cumming's ever-changing wardrobe\n\nGetty Images Alan Cumming rocking the 1970s gameshow host look\n\nThe Scottish actor and host of the US version of The Traitors greeted us on the red carpet on Sunday afternoon in a black morning-style suit with fabulous white cape detail that looked like angel wings. Our evening's host was introduced ahead of his arrival on stage in a video showing him in the Traitors' turret, jokingly claiming that taking the helm at the Bafta TV awards was \"the 12th biggest honour of my life\" and promising not to have a wardrobe malfunction (but \"whatever pops out pops out\u201d). The audience seemed to enjoy his gentle - and sometimes acerbic - humour at their expense and he treated us to three, yes three, costume changes. The morning suit was replaced with an electric-blue shiny suit featuring wide-leg trousers, complete with leopard-print shirt and corsage. That later changed to a pale pink suit with silver beading before a final switch to a dark brown velvet number. \"I changed again, so sue me,\" he told viewers.\n\nRuth Jones is planning a new project with James Corden\n\nGetty Images\n\nFresh from accepting her Bafta for best female comedy performance for her role in Gavin & Stacey: The Finale opposite James Corden, Jones said: \"I love working with James, I really do. And I hope that we will carry on working together... we will. Because we both like sitting in a room together. We do a lot of napping, but we do write as well.\" She said people had stopped asking about whether there will be any more Gavin & Stacey after last year's special, which saw her character Nessa marry Corden's Smithy. \"You don't really want to think about Ness and Smithy in a domestic situation, putting the bins out.\"\n\nDanny Dyer says some people will be 'fuming' at his win\n\nGetty Images Dyer is sporting a moustache for the filming of the second series of Rivals\n\nThe former EastEnders star picked up best male comedy performance for his role in Mr Bigstuff, in which he played one of two estranged brothers with very different personalities who try to rebuild their relationship. And afterwards he said: \"I can't believe it. Some people will be fuming [at my win]. But I've earned it. It's like, 'Wow, I've made it'. \"I've never really done it [comedy], I've not been known for it. My first outing in scripted comedy and to nick one of these is mental.\" And what could top that? A win for his football team earlier that afternoon, apparently. \"West Ham beat Man Utd and my future son-in-law [Jarrod Bowen] scored a goal... there's got to be a catch somewhere!\"\n\nMr Loverman winners were ready to party\n\nGetty Images Watch out - we hope Ariyon doesn't stand on his Bafta when he dances around it\n\nThe adaptation of Bernardine Evaristo's book Mr Loverman saw both its leading actor (Lennie James) and supporting actor (Ariyon Bakare) win acting prizes. James described it as \"the part of a lifetime\" and pointed out that it was rare to have a drama about a \"queer, black, old couple... I hope it sparks conversations in the wider community\u201d. Bakare gave one of the most emotional acceptance speeches of the night, and backstage explained why. \"I was homeless when I was 14. You don't ever think you'll do something like this. I'd go in and see half a play, I couldn't afford to see a whole show.\" Both stars were planning to celebrate in style. James simply told journalists, \"I'm going to get wrecked,\" while Bakare was planning to \"dance around my Bafta like women dance round their handbags\". Why not?\n\nITV's Post Office drama hopes to create more headlines\n\nFollowing a powerful speech about the impact the drama about the Post Office scandal had, the cast and creatives headed backstage to make a plea. The drama's writer, Gwyneth Hughes, pointed out that many of the sub-postmasters who were wrongly convicted are still waiting for compensation. \"Several compensation schemes are going on. Some of our main characters have not been paid.\" She said she hoped the Bafta win would raise awareness. \"If we're on the front pages tomorrow... I hope it helps.\" Producer Patrick Spence also made an impassioned entreaty: \"It's not over. We beg you... get the story out.\" When the BBC Breakfast team won the news coverage award later in the evening, it was for a Post Office special. The programme's editor, Richard Frediani, said: \"We've even got a story about the Post Office on the programme tomorrow in terms of someone's campaign for compensation. We will continue to tell their stories and ask questions on their behalf.\"\n\nKirsty Wark thinks Newsnight is 'safe'\n\nBafta Fellowship honouree Kirsty Wark, who left BBC Two's Newsnight programme in 2024 after 30 years, joked that she probably got her award \"for being 70, who knows?\" The long-running show was shortened by 15 minutes a year ago and its investigative films were cut. But Wark thinks it will survive. \"If Newsnight wasn't there, they'd have to reinvent it. I'd bet \u00a3500 that Newsnight is safe. You still need that programme at the end of the day to see what just happened.\"\n\nWhat can we look forward to next on the telly?\n\nGetty Images Alma's Not Normal star and creator Sophie Willan picked up the Bafta for best scripted comedy\n\nPlenty of the stars teased us with nods to possibilities of future series. Lennie James told us on the red carpet that despite being considered a \"limited series\", we may not have seen the back of Mr Loverman: \"I don't know that it's done.\" Anna Maxwell Martin discussed the possible return of Line of Duty but if it does come back, sadly, she won't be reprising her role as DCS Patricia Carmichael. \"Sometimes you're not allowed to revise certain roles due to contracts with other streamers,\" she explained to the BBC on the red carpet. The team behind Shogun, which won best international show, revealed that there will be a \"10-year time leap in part two\". Alma's Not Normal won't be returning for a third series having won the Bafta for best scripted comedy for season two. But creator Sophie Willan told us \"there might be something else in the pipeline\". A Christmas special perhaps?\n\nClive Myrie wants the Pope to join him on his travels\n\nThe daytime Bafta gong went to Clive Myrie's BBC Two show Caribbean Adventure and he'll be heading to Africa next week to film the second series. And who would he like to take with him? \"The new Pope - I think we could have some interesting converations. It's got Bafta written all over it!\" But the BBC news anchor won't be giving up the day job any time soon. \"I may end up doing more entertainment stuff as I'm an old bloke... but news is the core, I won't do anything that distracts me [from that].\"\n\nThe Traitors misses out\n\nGetty Images",

    "title": "The real problem facing Britain's depleted armed forces",
    "body": "The real problem facing Britain's shrinking military\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Jonathan Beale \u2022 bealejonathan Defence correspondent Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nOn a March day this year, a British nuclear-armed submarine quietly returned to its base on the west coast of Scotland after a record-breaking 204 days underwater. HMS Vanguard had 130 crew members on board. They had spent nearly seven months without fresh air or daylight, and with little communication. Patrols of the UK's nuclear-armed submarines are supposed to last no longer than three months. But the last eight patrols have all exceeded five months, as the navy's ageing fleet of submarines requires ever more time in maintenance. It means the submariners on board are spending longer and longer underwater. A submariner who was on board one of those long patrols described to me a worrying situation in which the crew ran low on food and medicines. Towards the end of the patrol he described how hungry crew members rummaged for tins of food in hidden compartments inside the submarine. He said they even had to make bread out of custard powder, because they'd run out of flour. The navy has long found it difficult to recruit sailors into its Submarine Service, often known as the \"Silent Service\". But the case of the 204-day patrol by HMS Vanguard raises a wider issue.\n\nCrown copyright Keir Starmer visits one of the Royal Navy's Vanguard Class submarines\n\nVirtually everyone agrees that Britain's armed forces are depleted. Troop numbers are down, morale is weak, and some ageing equipment is in a poor state. And all this comes at a time of greater geopolitical uncertainty, as the threat from Russia looms large across Europe. Within the next few months, the government will publish its long-awaited Strategic Defence Review - a consultation launched by Sir Keir Starmer shortly after he arrived in Downing Street last summer, designed to identify threats to Britain and recommend how the armed forces can meet them. But there are already doubts over how much it can realistically achieve. So, as the world becomes more dangerous, what can the government do to reverse the decline - and restore the UK to military readiness?\n\nDwindling troop numbers\n\nPoliticians from all sides, along with military chiefs, admit Britain's armed forces have been \"hollowed out\". It's true for the Royal Navy and the RAF - and perhaps most acutely, in the British army. In 2010 the regular Army was nearly 110,000 strong. Now, it is struggling to meet its target of 73,000 soldiers - not enough to fill Cardiff's Principality Stadium. Earlier this year defence minister and former Royal Marine, Al Carns, told a conference at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank, that the entire British Army could be \"expended\" within six to 12 months if it fought a war on a similar scale to the Ukraine conflict. Last summer the head of the army, General Sir Roly Walker, said the Army needed to be ready to fight a war by 2027 - an admission it isn't ready to fight one in its current state. He said the Army needs to leverage technology, such as drones, new software, and artificial intelligence.\n\nGetty Images Europe In 2010 the regular Army was nearly 110,000 strong. Today it would struggle to fill Cardiff's Principality Stadium\n\nBut Justin Crump, an Army Reserve Officer who heads the risk and intelligence company Sibylline, argues that boosts to technology won't make up for the lack of military hardware. \"We have big gaps and they're not going to get filled overnight,\" he says. The government is also promising to streamline the bureaucratic process of ordering new kit - trying to learn the painful lessons of past mistakes. By the time they eventually arrive, the delivery of hundreds of new Ajax armoured vehicles will have taken more than a decade.\n\nWeaknesses in its Nato commitments\n\nSpeak to any government minister about security, they'll no doubt talk about Nato. It's the cornerstone of the UK's security, the government says, and one that has only become more important since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. According to its Nato commitments, the UK is supposed to be able to field tens of thousands of troops at short notice to defend any Nato territory \u2013 with a war-fighting division made up of tanks, artillery, and heavy armour. But a former senior General told the BBC that in a real war it would run out of ammunition, spares and supplies within weeks or even days. Nor does Britain have much in terms of ground-based air defences \u2013 not enough to protect key military bases in the UK, yet alone its towns and cities.\n\nThe weaknesses in Britain's contribution to Nato became starkly apparent in February this year, when a group of British MPs visited a Nato military site in Tapa, Estonia, where British soldiers are deployed (alongside Danish and French troops). The point of the base is to deter or slow down an invasion from Russia - which is just 80 miles away over a land border. Mike Martin, a Liberal Democrat MP and former British Army Officer, said the Estonia visit was like going back in time, seeing the same equipment as when he first joined the Army as a reservist in 2004: ageing Challenger 2 tanks and Warrior armoured vehicles. What one former General described to me as \"legacy kit from the 1980's\" - old and dwindling in numbers. About 1,000 British troops are stationed at the site. At the time of the MPs' visit they were armed with some drones - though not many. Nor did they have much in the way of systems to block or jam enemy drones, either. They also have a handful of long-range artillery guns - important for land warfare. The British Army currently has a total of just 14. Even tiny Estonia has double that number. Defence sources say that since the MPs' visit, the Army has now begun to test some of the new technology it wants to introduce. They say it \"will help soldiers see further, and strike faster\".\n\nAFP/Getty Images Talk of a future British troop deployment to Ukraine, following a possible ceasefire, could pose a major challenge for the Armed Forces\n\nTalk of thousands of British troops being sent to Ukraine for a lengthy deployment, if there were to be a ceasefire in its war with Russia, would present another huge challenge. In the recent past the British army has just about managed to sustain a prolonged military campaign. But in Afghanistan, between 2006 and 2014, it was only fighting lightly armed Taliban insurgents. Even then it was stretched - with nine thousand troops being constantly rotated every six months. Crump says \"Afghanistan was painful enough, and we had 20,000 more people\". While he says providing a reassurance force for Ukraine \"might be doable \u2013 it would rapidly wear us down\".\n\nQuestions over the price tag\n\nThe government says it is addressing these challenges with its Strategic Defence Review. John Healey, the Defence Secretary, claims it will lead to the \"biggest shake up of UK defence for over 50 years\". But past reviews have rarely lived up to expectation \u2013 not least because the money available rarely matches ambitions. Most reviews are quickly overtaken by events. Harold Wilson's defence review of 1966 was overtaken just three years later by a crisis in Northern Ireland; whilst Tony Blair's review of 1998 came just three years before 9/11. Indeed, when work on this review began, the US - under President Joe Biden - was still the UK's closest and most reliable military partner. Now that's less clear.\n\nGetty Images Europe Defence spending was expected to be capped at 2.5% of GDP, but some have questioned whether that would be enough\n\nThere are also questions over the price tag. The review's terms of reference assumes that defence spending will be capped at 2.5% of the UK's national income, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP). But few in defence believe that'll be enough. One of the independent experts leading the review, General Sir Richard Barrons, has already said the UK should be spending at least 3% of GDP on its armed forces. Meanwhile, Nato's Secretary General, Mark Rutte, is pressing allies to increase defence spending to \"north of 3%\". President Donald Trump has gone even higher, urging Nato countries to spend 5%. The government's \"ambition\" is to boost spending to 3% at some time in the next parliament - which will have the added bonus of boosting growth, ministers say. Just last week Sir Keir said that extra investment will create a \"defence dividend\" for jobs and prosperity. Others think the review is too narrow in focus. A former military chief told the BBC that a review should first identify threats to the UK, and then work out how to shape the Armed Forces. It was \"bonkers\", they added, to conduct a defence review without it being \"nested\" in a broader cross-government security review.\n\nReuters John Healey claims the Strategic Defence Review will lead to the \"biggest shake up of UK defence for over 50 years\"\n\nAn MoD spokesperson said that boosts to defence spending \"will make Britain stronger and safer in an insecure world and will help us build a modern and resilient Armed Forces, with cutting-edge capabilities\". The defence review, they added, is \"wide-ranging and working at pace, looking hard at the threats we face and all the capabilities we need to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century\".\n\nLow morale and cases of harassment\n\nAttempts to broaden the Army's appeal - including high-profile recruitment campaigns targeting the so-called \"snowflake\" generation - have not been enough to reverse the decline. Nor have a series of slick television adverts called \"Belonging\", which aim to highlight the camaraderie of life in the forces. Last year, the UK's armed forces were losing 300 more full-time personnel each month than they'd been recruiting. In a MoD survey last year nearly six in ten military personnel rated morale as low. Just four in 10 said they were satisfied with service life \u2013 the lowest since records began. This government is trying to boost morale by improving military accommodation, plus last year's pay rise of 6% for armed forces personnel was the largest in two decades. Part of the problem is a broader cultural one: fewer people have an emotional connection with the armed forces, Crump says. The average Briton is now more likely to know someone in jail than serving in the military, he adds. Last year, the Army apologised to Kerry-Ann Knight, a black female soldier who fronted Army recruitment campaigns, after she described years of racist abuse and bullying that made her life while serving a \"living hell\". High profile stories of bullying and sexual harassment within the military can't have helped - particularly for women and minorities. The MoD has set a recruiting goal of 30% women by 2030, but they currently make up less than 12% of the regular armed forces - a figure which has hardly shifted in a decade.\n\nGetty Images Europe Women make up just under 12% of the regular armed forces, a figure that has hardly shifted in a decade\n\nBritain is not alone in struggling to fill its ranks. It's a problem experienced by many western nations relying on volunteers. Some governments have now introduced some form of conscription. In March, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced a plan to make all Polish men undergo compulsory military training. But there appears to be little appetite for conscription among the British public. A YouGov poll in September 2023 found that just 28% of the British public would support a one year military service. Younger people were particularly opposed. The government wants to get people interested from a young age, by expanding cadet forces in secondary schools. The MoD is also trying to keep better records of those troops who have left, and who could be recalled in a crisis. An MoD spokesperson said: \"We are committed to fixing Armed Forces recruitment and have already given personnel the largest pay rise in decades, scrapped 100 outdated recruitment policies, and passed legislation through the Commons to introduce a new Armed Forces Commissioner to improve service life.\"\n\nAI on the battlefield?\n\nWhatever comes out of the defence review, there is no expectation that troop numbers will increase in the near future. Analysts are, however, looking at radical solutions - including the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the battlefield. The most obvious example is AI-enabled drones, which are already being used in Ukraine to identify targets on their own, to deadly effect. But some also envisage a future in which machines could collect data on adversaries. A large land war in Europe is now focusing minds. Senior British military officers, as well as politicians, have repeatedly stated the UK 's armed forces must be ready to fight. But there still appears to be a temptation to use their power and influence much further away from home.\n\nCrown copyright Ministers maintain that their soon-to-be published defence review really could reset the dial and restore the UK to military readiness\n\nLast month, HMS Prince of Wales - one of the Navy's two aircraft carriers \u2013 left Portsmouth on an eight-month voyage to the other side of the world. It's the biggest UK defence endeavour this year, involving nearly 4,000 personnel, along with the support of allies, sailing to the Pacific and back. Healey says it will demonstrate the UK's ability to deploy a major military force around the world, while at the same time promoting British trade. Emma Salisbury, a fellow at the Council on Geostrategy, a think tank, says the carrier's Pacific deployment holds a powerful symbolic importance. \"It's a message not just of deterrence against Russia, but also against China,\" she says. \"In the world as it is now, we can't look at things geographically. Everything is interconnected. It's linking together our alliances and partnerships on a global scale.\" But the deployment also highlights the challenges of trying to do more with less. Britain can only afford to have an episodic appearance in the Indo-Pacific. And the Trump administration has warned UK and other European allies to focus on their own doorstep, rather than faraway adventures. The carrier deployment is another strain on finite resources. Of course, ministers maintain that their soon-to-be published defence review really could reset the dial and restore the UK to military readiness. But so far no government has really been willing to tackle the greatest dilemma for UK defence: do less or spend a lot more.",

    "body": "BBC team's tense encounter with sanctioned Israeli settler while filming in West Bank\n\n12 hours ago Share Save Fergal Keane & Alice Doyard BBC News Reporting from Jordan Valley Share Save\n\nMoment BBC has tense encounter with sanctioned Israeli settler\n\nDust was rising on the track. It hung in the hot midday air as the white jeep came towards us. The driver was less than a minute away. \"I think it's Moshe Sharvit,\" said Gil Alexander, 72, a devout religious Jew who tries to protect Palestinian shepherds from intimidation by Jewish settlers. Over the last year we've been documenting his work with shepherds in the northern Jordan Valley, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The man approaching us was placed under sanctions by Britain and the EU last year after they said he had used \"physical aggression, threatened families at gunpoint, and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace Palestinian communities\". In a case reported by our colleagues at BBC Eye Investigates last year, a Palestinian grandmother alleged that Moshe Sharvit had forced her to leave her family home in October 2023. Ayesha Shtayyeh also said he pointed a gun at her head and threatened to kill her.\n\n\"We've been here for 50 years\u2026What have I ever done to him?\" she asked when BBC Eye interviewed her. She said her family's troubles began after Moshe Sharvit established a so-called 'outpost'- a settlement that is illegal under both Israeli and international law - chasing away the family's sheep, damaging property and constantly threatening them. The alleged incident with the gun was the final straw. Moshe Sharvit did not respond to BBC Eye's requests for a response to Ayesha's account. Back on the mountainside, the man accused of this violence stopped his car and approached us. Nodding towards Gil Alexander he asked us: \"Do you know he's a very dangerous guy?\" When our translator explained to Moshe Sharvit we were from the BBC he said: \"Ah the BBC\u2026 great lovers of Israel\u2026\" He went on to call us bad and dangerous people. Addressing our translator he said: \"So, do you understand that they're the people who are most dangerous to the State of Israel?\" Then he phoned the police, asking them to come to the scene. When he wasn't calling the police he filmed us filming him. Moshe Sharvit and Gil Alexander represent starkly different visions of Israel's future. Moshe Sharvit believes all of the West Bank - which settlers and the Israeli government call Judea and Samaria - were given by God to the Jews. In this he is supported by senior ministers in the government, including the Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and the Minister of Public Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir. Both men are settlers and leaders of far-right ultranationalist parties.\n\nAyesha Shtayyeh alleges Moshe Sharvit threatened her with a gun and told her to leave her home of 50 years\n\nSmotrich has said Gaza will be \"totally destroyed\" and that its people will be \"totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places\". The 'other places' he envisages are foreign countries. Ben-Gvir, who is responsible for the police, has convictions for inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organisation. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, relies on the support of the far-right settler movement to keep his government in power. He criticised the sanctions imposed on Moshe Sharvit and other settlers, saying his government viewed the move \"with great severity\". US sanctions against Moshe Sharvit were dropped when President Donald Trump came to power. The UN's top court ruled last year that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is against international law and that all settlement activity is illegal. Israel rejects this and argues that settlements are necessary for security, citing lethal attacks by Palestinian gunmen on settlers, such as the killing of three people last January in the West Bank.\n\nGil Alexander (left) and Moshe Sharvit both phoned the police\n\nSettlement expansion is anathema to Gil Alexander. He considers himself a Zionist, but within the existing borders of Israel. These are the frontiers that existed before it seized the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. He is part of a network called the Jordan Valley Activists \u2013 Moshe Sharvit calls them \"anarchists\" - offering solidarity, and working for peaceful co-existence with the Palestinians. \"What they [the settlers] want to see happen,\" Gil Alexander told us, \"[is] that it will be an area completely free of Arabs. It isn't Moshe. It's all the people above him who sent him here. Meaning from the top\". Moshe Sharvit's desire to have the Jordan Valley empty of Palestinians is shared by the leader of the regional council, a government-supported body, David Elhayani, who has visited the sanctioned settler. In his air conditioned office about 15km (9 miles) from Moshe Sharvit's settler outpost he told us \"the notion of settler violence is an invention of the anarchist, extreme left meant to harm the settlement image\". As for the future of the Palestinians, he was emphatic. They should go to neighbouring Jordan. \"This country needs to be free of Arabs. It's the only way. It's a global interest. Why global? Because the minute there won't be Arabs here it will be a Jewish nation for the Jews who won't have to hurt each other, there won't be conflict, there won't be anything.\"\n\nGil Alexander, who describes himself as a Zionist, believes Israeli territory should end at the 1967 borders\n\nGil Alexander and Moshe Sharvit have a history of antagonism. During an altercation on a Palestinian farmer's land in January 2023, Moshe Sharvit says Gil Alexander tried to seize his firearm from its holster. While speaking to our translator he produced a video of the incident on his phone. \"You can see Gil Alexander. Same hat and glasses. That's me. Here you see he grabs my gun.\" Gil Alexander says he was acting in self-defence after Moshe Sharvit had grabbed his walking stick, and the phone of his friend and violently pushing it. He says he feared Moshe Sharvit was going to use the weapon. As a result, Moshe Sharvit got a restraining order which forbids Gil Alexander from being within 2.5km (1.5 miles) of his farm. The police have charged Gil Alexander with illegal possession of a weapon (the one he allegedly tried to take from Moshe Sharvit) and assault. The issue will be considered by the Israeli courts. Moshe Sharvit himself is the subject of a restraining order forbidding him to approach a Palestinian family living near his outpost for six months, since March this year. During our encounter the settler claimed that Gil Alexander had breached his restraining order by taking us to the high ground overlooking the valley. The peace activist told us later that he had mistakenly strayed just over half a kilometre inside the area of the order. Although Moshe Sharvit's settlement is illegal, even under Israeli law, it has not been removed. Human rights organisations and numerous eyewitnesses testify that the Israeli army and police frequently stand by while settlers attack Palestinian villages. The violence has escalated sharply since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped, and which triggered the Gaza war.\n\nMoshe Sharvit approached, blocked the road and phoned the police\n\nAccording to a report issued by the UN office for Humanitarian Affairs there were 1,804 attacks by settlers against Palestinians in the period January 2024 to March 2025. The Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din (There is Law), reported that only 3% of complaints made against settlers resulted in a conviction. In six days last month - from 22 to 28 April - the UN recorded 14 incidents involving settlers that left 36 Palestinians injured. In the tense atmosphere on the mountainside, and wanting to avoid any escalation, we decided to leave. As we walked away, Moshe Sharvit went to his jeep and drove ahead of us, stopping where the track turned down the mountain. Our way out was blocked. There was no-one we could appeal to apart from the man preventing us from leaving. Again, he phoned the police asking them to come. Gil Alexander phoned the police and his lawyer. Our team was worried that more settlers would come. Then something surprising happened. I suggested to Moshe Sharvit that he should agree to be interviewed. After a brief pause, he said: \"Bring the camera.\" What followed was less an interview, than a series of declarations. He was doing the work of God, he said. Why did local Bedouin shepherds say they were very afraid of him? I asked. \"No, that is a lie. They're telling stories so the world will think we're crazy. It's not true. It's all lies that are built on lies of dozens of years of lying\u2026\" he said. \"The Arabs, since the formation of the country and before - all the past 77 years they've been preoccupied with harming the people of Israel, harming the land of Israel and causing the nation of Israel to be miserable and pitiful. But they don't understand that the harder they try, the Lion will wake from his sleep and within one day we'll end this story.\"\n\nHe repeated the analogy of the Lion later in the interview saying, in what sounded like ominous words, that the Palestinians were \"pushing the lion so hard into the corner that there will be no choice left but to finish this story\". \"7 October was small. One day it'll be big.\" As for peaceful co-existence such as Gil Alexander supports, he said there was \"no such thing as peace with enemies who try to destroy you\". Moshe Sharvit's brother Harel was killed fighting in Gaza in December 2023. His world is the pastureland, the stony hills of the Jordan Valley, his sheep and cattle, the bed and breakfast he has opened. He produced a glossy video, replete with a backing track of American country music, to promote his venture. He spoke with contempt for the British sanctions against him. They were a new kind of antisemitism, he claimed. \"The minute someone tries to hurt me I get stronger. My spirit\u2026I receive energies, my spirit continues on its mission, I continue advancing forward and planting roots deep into the land of Israel. I'm not bothered by Britain or America or anyone.\"\n\nMoshe Sharvit agreed to be interviewed\n\nThen he drove away. We were free to move on. Later as we were having lunch in a caf\u00e9 about 15km (nine miles) away, a policeman appeared, looking for Gil Alexander. He went with the police officer for questioning. After about an hour he returned, telling us he had been ordered not to enter the Jordan Valley for two weeks. He plans to lodge his own complaint against Moshe Sharvit over the incident. We went to Gil Alexander's home in a kibbutz inside Israel that overlooks the Valley. Gunmen from the Palestinian city of Jenin fired at the kibbutz two years ago. Gil Alexander is not a pacifist. If he is attacked by Hamas or any other group, he will defend himself. He said: \"A son of our friends, two months ago he was killed here by a terrorist. He was a soldier in the reserves, 46 years old with six children. He volunteered for the reserves to protect me.\" \"If the army hadn't been there, they would have come here. He was killed while defending me. And today he is buried next to my two sons.\" But Gil Alexander seemed weary as we sat drinking tea amid the bright red flowers of his well-tended garden, and the fluttering yellow flags that symbolise Israel's hostages held in Gaza. He spoke of a beloved nephew killed fighting in Lebanon in an earlier war. Did he not, I wondered, at the age of 72, think about retiring from the struggle and enjoying his garden? He laughed. There was no chance of that. After two of his sons took their own lives \u2013 one was in the army, the other was about to enter the military \u2013 he had found a purpose in working for what he calls the \"humanitarian\" ideals of Judaism. \"After the tragedies of my sons, if I don't find meaning in life, I'll go crazy\u2026 And the things I do, are things I believe in. And these are things I also got from my father who was in the French underground during World War Two and fought for French liberation but was against any type of occupation and said, 'Occupation is Occupation.'\" Two days after our encounter with Moshe Sharvit, a lone woman peace activist filmed him banging on the window of her car and rocking the vehicle. The woman is clearly frightened by the intimidation. Moshe Sharvit acts as if he has nothing to fear.",

    "body": "Eurovision act Remember Monday: 'The closer we get, the hungrier we become'\n\n7 hours ago Share Save Mark Savage Music Correspondent Share Save\n\nSarah Louise Bennett Remember Monday will represent the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest in Switzerland this week (L-R): Charlotte Steele, Lauren Byrne and Holly-Anne Hull.\n\nSince Remember Monday were announced as the UK's Eurovision act in March, they've barely slept in their own beds. \"It's definitely in the single digits,\" says singer Holly-Anne Hull, trying to calculate how many nights she has spent at home. \"We don't have time for that.\" Instead, they've been on a whirlwind tour of Europe, meeting fans, filming endless TikToks and performing their song, What The Hell Just Happened, to anyone who'll listen. If they're tired, it doesn't show. The country-pop trio \u2013 Lauren Byrne, Holly-Anne Hull and Charlotte Steele \u2013 are chatty, excited and focused on fun, and for good reason. They formed at school over a decade ago, and determinedly stayed together during long periods where, in their words, \"no-one was listening\". Even after a successful turn on The Voice in 2019, Charlotte had to return to her job as a deputy head teacher, while Lauren and Holly-Anne appeared in West End shows like Phantom of the Opera and Six: The Musical. Eurovision offers chance to change that. They head to Basel, Switzerland this week, hoping to erase the memories of Olly Alexander and Mae Muller, who both finished at the bottom end of the table. It helps that Remember Monday's song is a certified banger - full of glittery glam-pop flourishes and sizzling harmonies that (crucially) they can pull off live. Just before they set off for Euroland, we sat down with the trio to discuss quitting their jobs, overcoming phobias, and the dreaded \"nul points\".\n\nThe band have travelled all over Europe to promote their Eurovision song, What The Hell Just Happened?\n\nIt's eight weeks since you were announced as the UK's Eurovision entry\u2026 Charlotte: No, it can't be. It feels like six years! How many air miles have you racked up in that time? Lauren: Honestly, I feel bad about our carbon footprint. Charlotte: The thing is, I'm a nervous flyer. I always put an eye mask on, put my headphones in and avoid looking out the window. Then we had to catch a propellor plane from Reykjavik in Iceland, and as it was taking off, the whole thing was shaking from side to side. Lauren: It was really treacherous\u2026 but then, the next Easyjet flight we had to catch, Charlotte was like, 'What a breeze'. Charlotte: I was smiling, talking. It's like I was cured! When I first heard What The Hell Just Happened, I thought it sounded like something from Six: The Musical\u2026 Then I discovered you'd actually been in it. Lauren: That was me! I was Jane Seymour. She's the one that died, instead of being beheaded. Was it always the plan to put a musical theatre vibe in the song? Lauren: We wrote a brief for the song and there were so many references: Bohemian Rhapsody, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter. But we also said 'let's not be afraid to write the pop version of Defying Gravity'. We wanted it to have all that epicness and drama and the West End tricks you don't get in pop music. Your guide to all 37 of this year\u2019s Eurovision entries\n\nHow to win Eurovision, according to the experts\n\nJohann Persson/ Manuel Harlan Among the band's West End credits are Phantom of the Opera, where Holly-Anne played Christine Daa\u00e9; and Matilda, where Lauren played Miss Honey.\n\nYou wrote 15 songs in total. What were the rejects like? Holly-Anne: There are a few we'll definitely keep [for our album] but there was also one called Achilles Heel that went straight in the bin. Charlotte and Lauren [singing]: How do you feel, Achilles? How is your heel, Achilles? Holly-Anne [cringing]: We'd been writing for three weeks and I think we started to go delusional! That reminds me of something Ed Sheeran says about songwriting: A tap has to run brown before it runs clear. Charlotte: It's so true, and funnily enough, What The Hell Just Happened was the last song we wrote, a day before the deadline. We'd got to the point where we were like 'let's just go 100% on every idea and see where it lands'. Holly-Anne: We thought we had the Eurovision Song, I would say, four or five times. Then this one came up and we were like 'OK, it's beaten all of them'. What can you tell me about your performance? Holly-Anne: We come from theatre background, so it's definitely going to be theatrical. We want to give that a girl-band, concert feeling, like you're stepping into the world of Remember Monday. There's a line in the song about ripping your dress. Is that a sneaky Bucks Fizz reference? Lauren: Oh my God! Let's say yes. We didn't write it specifically with that in mind... but if the shoe fits! Charlotte: There's loads of little Easter eggs in the lyrics about our friendship. We've had a lot of nights out that ended in a tattoo parlour or losing a shoe somehow.\n\nEBU The trio's Eurovision set will include a fallen chandelier and a mock boudoir, while their pastel-coloured costumes have been described as \"Bridgerton meets Moulin Rouge\"\n\nDo you remember the first time you met? Holly-Anne: It's impossible to tell because we were in the same sixth form but for the first year we were in different classes. Lauren: I remember Charlotte coming into my class and singing that song from Parade. Charlotte [singing]: \"You don't know this maaan.\" Holly-Anne: Then, in the second year, we all joined the same performing arts class, and we were like 'oh, let's sing together'. When you graduated you all had full-time jobs \u2013 so how did you keep the band together? Charlotte: We always had Mondays off\u2026 hence the band name. Holly-Anne: It was so important to us to keep the band alive that we just never let it die. Charlotte: At one point, Holly went on tour for a year and we flew out to Singapore so we could be together. Lauren: Then, maybe 18 months ago, we quit our jobs to do this full-time. Charlotte: We thought, if we don't throw everything in now, we'll always regret it. Were your resignation letters like, 'I'm off to be a star!'? Lauren: Well, Holly and I were in the theatre, so we just didn't renew our contracts, whereas Charlotte was actually a deputy head teacher. Charlotte: The head was one of my closest friends and a lot of the kids had already seen us at gigs \u2013 so everyone knew it was gonna happen. It was just a matter of time.\n\nRemember Monday / Holly-Anne Hull The trio have been performing together since they met at sixth form college in Farnborough\n\nAre you prepared for how overwhelming Eurovision week is? Lauren: Yeah, but we're quite good at immersing ourselves in what we're doing. Charlotte: Even if there wasn't a bubble around us, the three of us make a bubble. Eurovision is all we talk about, even if we're not together. Lauren: And then I'm sure from the 18th of May onwards, we'll have a fair amount of downtime. Holly-Anne: The comedown is going to be rough. What are your hopes for the result? Holly-Anne: We do have a preference. And I think the closer we get to it, the more hungry we are for a good result. A placement in the single digits would be nice.\n\nSteve McMahon The band received a warm reception at the Eurovision pre-party in Madrid",

    "title": "Khloe Kardashian popcorn: Are protein snacks useful and worth it?",
    "body": "From Kardashian popcorn to pancakes - is the protein health craze worth it?\n\n9 hours ago Share Save George Sandeman BBC News Share Save\n\nBBC\n\n\"High-protein\" versions of snacks and food staples are all over our supermarket shelves - from pancakes and pasta, to rice pudding and oven pizza. Celebrities are getting in on the act too. Khloe Kardashian unveiled Khloud Protein Popcorn a fortnight ago, which she described as \"the perfect combination of a tasty snack and a boost of protein to fuel your day\", while Zac Efron promoted a protein-rich porridge in January. But is this increased advertising of protein just a marketing gimmick or are these products actually useful if you're trying to build muscle or live a healthy life? And is it worth the extra cost?\n\nSales of them are rising; figures shared with BBC News by the research agency Mintel show that, excluding sports nutrition items, 8.3% of food product launches made claims about being a source of protein, or having high levels of it, in the first three months of 2025. That was up from 6.1% in 2024 and 4.6% the year before. Kiti Soininen, a research director at Mintel, says protein claims are being added to food with naturally high levels of the nutrient, like chicken breasts and pulses, but also on products you wouldn't expect.\n\nGetty Images Khloe Kardashian is the latest celebrity to release or promote a protein advertised snack\n\n\"Mousses, desserts, granola, pancakes, even the odd pizza, are coming through with a high-protein claim,\" she says. \"Protein is enjoying a bit of a 'health halo' at the moment.\" Ethan Smith, a personal trainer in Liverpool, says high-protein diets are necessary for building muscle but that it ought to be done without the high protein snacks and drinks you see in shops. \"I'm a huge believer that there is nothing better than whole foods,\" he says. \"You can get the protein that you need from vegetables and lean meats.\" He believes the convenience of high-protein snacks, combined with the positive perception of the nutrient among customers, has led to manufacturers using protein as a marketing tool. For manufacturers to claim their product is a source of protein, they must show regulators at least 12% of its energy value is provided by protein. To make a claim that a product is high in protein, the figure is 20%. To help reach these scores they can add protein-rich ingredients to their products, like nuts and pulses, or make them more dense by removing water.\n\n\"When someone in a rush is getting a meal deal for lunch, you can see why they would reach for a protein bar or drink instead of two boiled eggs,\" he says. \"In my 12 years as a personal trainer, I've never seen as much hype around the benefits of protein as I am now.\" The benefits of protein range from muscle building and sports performance to helping with weight loss by suppressing appetite and helping women during pregnancy. If you're trying to build muscle you need to consume around 1.6g of protein per kilogram of your body weight each day, says Dr Paul Morgan, a university lecturer in human nutrition. He says for the average person trying to ensure their general health, this figure should be around 1.2g. He thinks many of the supermarket products advertising their protein content are \"gimmicky\" and warns they might not be as good for you as advertised. \"I think they do have a benefit but we are wary that a lot of them are ultra processed foods and that's a really topical area [in our field] that we don't know enough about,\" he says.\n\nThe risk of consuming too much protein\n\nUltra-processed foods have come under scrutiny recently with one study published last month linking them to early death. He explains that researchers in his field are trying to understand the differing impact on muscles that two similar protein sources might have when one of them is ultra-processed. Another issue is calories because putting on weight is the most common problem people have when they are trying to consume more protein, Dr Morgan explains, as any excess is stored in the body as fat. Some protein advertised snacks and drinks can have as many calories as regular products using similar ingredients. Nature Valley's protein peanut and chocolate bars have 489kcal per 100g, while Cadbury's peanut brunch bars, which also contain chocolate, have 485kcal at the same weight. Dr Morgan dismisses theories that eating too much protein can damage your bones or harm your kidneys, though there are exceptions if you have a pre-existing health condition.\n\nGetty Images Extra protein consumption is necessary for people who want to develop muscle by lifting weights",

    "body": "PM 'toughens migration rules' and Zelensky ready to 'face Putin'\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Share Save\n\nMany of Monday's papers are leading on the government's new plans to control the levels of migration into the UK. The Guardian says the prime minister is toughening rules in what it calls a \"challenge to Reform [UK]\", which inflicted losses on Labour in the recent local elections. It states that adults such as spouses, siblings, parents and grown-up children who accompany foreign workers to the UK will be expected to pass an English language test, while care homes will be prevented from recruiting staff from abroad.\n\n\"Migrants must earn right to stay... and improve their English,\" headlines the i Paper as it quotes Sir Keir Starmer saying new immigrants have to earn the \"privilege, not right\" to settle in the UK. The paper analyses this as the government \"seeking to seize [the] narrative from surging Reform UK\".\n\nThe Times also goes with migrants needing to \"earn their right to remain\", with those who pay their taxes on time, work in the public sector or have high-skilled jobs, or volunteer in the community, being \"prioritised for residency rights\". Shadow home secretary Chris Philip says it is a \"joke\" to say the plans will be tough on criminal migrants.\n\n\"Migrants must wait ten years to become British\", the Daily Express says under what it calls a \"crackdown\". It explains that automatic settlement and citizenship for anyone living in the UK for five years will also end. The paper hears from the Conservatives who accuse the government of \"pretending to be tough\" on the issue.\n\nThe Conservative response is also highlighted by the Daily Mail. It says the Tories have called the plans \"laughable\" for not including a cap on numbers and the paper adds that critics \"immediately questioned\" how success would be measured. The prime minister vows that \"migration numbers will fall\", the paper adds, as it puts the other side of the political argument.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph focuses on another part of the wide-ranging proposals with the headline \"Starmer to shut ECHR migrant loophole\". It says the white paper will \"tighten legislation\" that currently allow courts to grant asylum to what it calls \"foreign criminals and illegal migrants\" under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\n\nThe Sun leads on an exclusive which claims that while Starmer is announcing his crackdown on foreign criminals being granted asylum, Trinidadian rapper Bang Em Smurf - real name Daniel Calliste - is staying at a taxpayer-funded hotel while seeking asylum in the UK. The paper reports that the rapper - who is a \"pal\" of 50 Cent - has previously been jailed in the US \"following a shootout\".\n\nThe Financial Times says Chinese companies are \"accelerating a purge of foreign components\" from their supply chains, and were \"increasing efforts to source domestic inputs\" to replace them with. This follows the \"steep tariffs\" slapped on China by the US. An analyst for research provider Rhodium Group says the tariffs increase Beijing's desire to become self-sufficient - something Chinese President Xi Jinping pushed for in policies called \"Made in China 2025\".\n\n\"I'll face Putin to get peace\", reads Metro's headline on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to hold \"direct negotiations\" with his Russian counterpart. The paper says Zelensky accepted President Vladimir Putin's peace talks offer after pressure from the US president - and hours after saying there would be no talks without a ceasefire first.\n\nThe Daily Mirror claims \"weight-loss jabs 'cut cancer risk'\", according to new research that suggests they could cut the risk by nearly half. One expert says it could \"herald a new era of preventative cancer medicine\", the paper reports.\n\nAnd finally, the Daily Star- keen as ever on a weather-related story - splashes a Photoshopped image of beach-ready seagulls - towel, sunnies and hat in tow - and the sub-headline \"27C hotter than Malta\". It says a \"two-week heatwave starts\" is starting today and that Britain will be warmer than Mediterranean resorts including Malta. \"Grab an ice cream!\" it adds.\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images",

    "body": "Zelensky challenges Putin to meet him after Trump demands Ukraine-Russia talks\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Alex Kleiderman BBC News Share Save\n\nEPA\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin \"personally\" in Istanbul on Thursday for talks over ending the war. His post on X came shortly after Donald Trump demanded Ukraine agree to Putin's offer of direct talks between the two countries in Turkey. \"There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in T\u00fcrkiye on Thursday. Personally,\" Zelensky wrote. He had earlier said his country was open to talks with Russia but only after a ceasefire was in place.\n\nWestern powers called for a 30-day pause in fighting to begin on Monday after European leaders spearheading the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" met in Kyiv on Saturday. Putin's offer of direct talks followed that intervention. On Sunday Trump then posted on social media that Ukraine should agree to this \"immediately\" and it would provide clarity on whether there was a way to end the war. \"At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly\" he said, adding: \"Have the meeting, now!\" In his post on X, Zelensky said he hoped Russia would agree to the ceasefire before the talks. \"We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,\" he said. In a late-night address on Saturday, Putin invited Ukraine to take part in \"serious negotiations\" over the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

    "body": "Concern lesson plans encouraged strangulation during sex\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Gemma Dunstan BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images Relationships and sexuality education curriculum is mandatory for those aged three to 16 in Wales\n\nA council has been criticised for creating a PowerPoint presentation that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex that was intended to be used in schools. The slides included the sentence: \"It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first.\" Bridgend council said it was part of a \"draft version\", never shown to children and the slides were dropped following feedback from professionals. But experts and politician Natasha Asghar have asked why the Welsh authority \"deemed appropriate\" to include an illegal act in any draft of the presentation.\n\nBridgend council commissioned the school resource from their in-house domestic abuse service, called Assia, and a presentation was leaked last year. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan were among those sent an open letter raising concerns of parents and professionals that deliver sex education lessons. Claire Waxman, the victims' commissioner for London, also told The Times that the material was \"deeply concerning\". Former Conservative MEP Baroness Jacqueline Foster also spoke out, telling Parliament non-fatal strangulation was a criminal offence that could be punished with imprisonment. The Welsh government said non-fatal strangulation was \"dangerous and illegal\" and added the resources Bridgend council gave schools \"make this clear\".\n\nBridgend council commissioned the school resource but said the slide was removed at a draft stage and never shown to children\n\nBridgend council have since issued a \"clarification\" statement that said \"the slides were part of inaccurate or out-of-date information that was either updated or removed\". But it raised further questions as to why the material and messaging existed in the first place, so BBC Wales asked them for more information. The authority said the slide was part of an \"active presentation\". \"The idea was that the presenter would use the slide to stimulate debate before advising participants that non-fatal strangulation is actually a dangerous, illegal crime which carries significant penalties,\" said Bridgend council's statement. They said that part of the presentation was dropped following feedback from professionals consulted during the drafting process. Sources including Michael Conroy, who trains professionals like teachers to deliver sex education lessons, have told the BBC that they understand the presentation was offered to schools and youth settings to show.\n\nMichael Conroy Michael Conroy works with schools in Wales and England and said there's a \"vulnerability for schools\" because they're expected to cover topics \"none of their staff are trained to deliver\"\n\nHowever, the council denied this and said it was only sent \"as a work in progress with a small group of professionals for their insight and views\". \"It was presented as this is what we will teach to children, there was intention there,\" said Mr Conroy, a former personal, social and health education co-ordinator in schools, who did not receive the presentation from the council directly. When Mr Conroy first saw the slide in question, he said it was \"terrifying\" and there was not any additional information about safety on other slides. \"The idea that someone is saying it's OK to strangle a person if you get a 'yes' is atrocious,\" added Mr Conroy of Men at Work. \"It's the opposite of safeguarding, it's a terrible breach of trust.\" Welsh Parliament member Asghar said she had been contacted by \"concerned parents\" and called for Bridgend council to release the material.\n\nGetty Images Welsh Senedd member Natasha Asghar says it is important young people are equipped with the right information to \"make good choices\"\n\n\"I'm requesting both versions of this PowerPoint presentation,\" said the Conservative Senedd member who sits on the Children, Young People and Education Committee. \"We shouldn't disguise the fact those responsible for creating the content originally deemed this appropriate. We need to look into this to make sure children are being taught properly.\" Despite the council saying that the slide was not to be used in isolation, she said: \"It does not negate from that fact those responsible for the content originally deemed it appropriate. This is where I have my concerns.\" Asghar said she had written to the council leader but was without a reply. The example has raised concerns from parents, experts and politicians about what is being taught to children in school during sex education lessons. \"I know government will dismiss this as the work of just one sex ed provider but all parents should ask to see the materials their children are being taught in PHSE,\" said Fiona Mackenzie, who led a campaign to end the so-called rough sex defence in the Domestic Abuse bill.\n\nFiona Mackenzie Campaigner Fiona Mackenzie has called for governments to take control of sex education material",

    "body": "Poland accuses Russia of arson over 2024 shopping centre fire\n\n7 hours ago Share Save Jamie Whitehead BBC News Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nPoland has accused Russian intelligence services of orchestrating a massive fire that nearly completely destroyed a shopping centre in the capital Warsaw last year. In a post on X, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland knows \"for sure\" that the blaze at the Marywilska shopping centre was caused by arson ordered by the Russian special services. Some of those responsible are already in custody, Tusk added, while all the others alleged to have been involved have been identified and are being searched for. Moscow has not commented on the allegations, but has previously denied accusations of sabotage in Europe.\n\nThe fire in May 2024 destroyed 1,400 small businesses, with many of the staff there being members of Warsaw's Vietnamese community. Poland carried out a year-long investigation into the incident, which has now concluded the fire was organised by an unnamed person in Russia. A joint statement by Poland's justice and interior ministers said the actions of those in custody were \"organised and directed by a specific person residing in the Russian Federation.\" The two ministries added that they were co-operating with Lithuania \"where some of the perpetrators also carried out acts of diversion\". Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has detained and convicted several people accused of sabotage on behalf of Russian intelligence services. Polish officials have said that these attacks have been part of a \"hybrid war\" waged by Moscow. Hybrid warfare is when a hostile state carries out an anonymous, deniable attack, usually in highly suspicious circumstances. It will be enough to harm their opponent, especially their infrastructure assets, but stop short of being an attributable act of war. Nato also believes Russia is waging \"hybrid warfare\" in Europe, with the aim of punishing or deterring Western nations from continuing their military support for Ukraine. Russia has denied repeated allegations by Nato countries that its secret services are engaged in sabotage operations across Europe.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBack in March, Lithuanian prosecutors accused Russia's military intelligence service of being behind an arson attack on a branch of Ikea in the capital Vilnius last year. At the time, Tusk said Lithuania had confirmed Warsaw's \"suspicions that [those] responsible for setting fires to shopping centres in Vilnius and Warsaw are the Russian secret services.\" Two Ukrainian suspects were arrested.",

    "title": "US PGA Championship: Rory McIlroy favourite to win at Quail Hollow course he loves",
    "body": "That championship was played in steamy August, another contributing factor to the layout feeling unfamiliar. Now the big changes have bedded with further refinements carried out two years ago.\n\nMcIlroy posted his most recent wins there in 2021 and last year and will be delighted the PGA is played in May these days. Quail Hollow, boasting 61 bunkers and four water hazards, will feel reassuringly familiar and just how he likes it.\n\nBut it will be set up tougher than it usually is for the Wells Fargo Championship (now known as the Truist). Chief championships officer Kerry Haigh is known for delivering stern but fair examinations.\n\nThe rough is likely to be half an inch longer and a new ninth tee adds length to the scorecard. Slopes on a dozen greens have been softened, which should offer a wider range of hole locations to challenge the 156-man field.\n\nOf those competitors, though, no one should have more confidence than McIlroy. As much as it can in this capricious game, everything appears to be falling into place.\n\nUnburdened by ending his 11-year wait for a fifth major to join the all time greats as a grand slammer, he is now heading to his favourite venue on and off the course.\n\nThe traditional May date for Quail Hollow's regular tour stop means he has celebrated the majority of his adult birthdays in the Charlotte area. \"I love coming back here,\" he says.\n\n\"It's a place that I'm very comfortable at. With Quail Hollow, the city of Charlotte in general and the people.\"\n\nHe will gain a rapturous following this week, coming in as a redemptive and all conquering hero of Augusta. \"All these people have watched me grow up,\" he added.\n\n\"I won here for the first time as a 20-year-old. They've seen my progression throughout the years.\"\n\nWhen the then curly haired youngster won in 2010 he fired weekend rounds of 66 and 62 after making the cut with nothing to spare. He beat Phil Mickelson by four shots.\n\nIt was a true glimpse into the future.\n\nForever finding the most dramatic storylines, on that occasion McIlroy capped his victory by outrageously holing out on the closing green from more than 40 feet. It lodged the first of so many glorious memories at this venue.\n\nWhich begs the question of whether there is another just around the corner? Victory this week would move McIlroy alongside Sir Nick Faldo's six majors and tie the record for any European in the modern era.\n\nWeather forecasters predict a stormy build up, suggesting a soft golf course to put an even greater premium on length off the tee. And that suits McIlroy and his booming driver just fine.\n\nGolf is notoriously difficult to predict, but there can be no argument that there are many reasons for continued optimism for McIlroy's legion of fans.\n\nThe man himself has observed: \"I feel like there's not a place on this golf course where I haven't hit it from and don't have some sort of memory of what to do.\"\n\nAnd, unarguably, most of those memories are very positive indeed.",

    "title": "Hamas to release US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander as part of ceasefire efforts",
    "body": "Hamas to release US-Israeli hostage as part of efforts to reach Gaza ceasefire\n\n4 hours ago Share Save Rushdi Abualouf Gaza correspondent Hugo Bachega Middle East correspondent Share Save\n\nReuters Edan Alexander's grandmother holds a photo of him, as she called for his release again last month\n\nHamas says it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who is believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. Hamas said it was also intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid. Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. Earlier a senior Hamas official told the BBC that the Palestinian armed group was holding direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar. The Israeli PM's office said it had not committed to any ceasefire but only to a \"safe corridor\" for Mr Alexander's release.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu's office said preparations to intensify fighting were still continuing, and the release of Mr Alexander had been made possible because of military pressure on Hamas. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations with the US in Qatar told the BBC that Hamas's announcement was intended as a goodwill gesture before Trump's arrival. He said another meeting between Hamas and the mediators was scheduled for early Monday morning to finalise the process of Mr Alexander's release, which would require a temporary halt to Israeli military activity and a suspension of aerial operations during the handover. President Trump confirmed Alexander's release in a post on Truth Social, calling it \"monumental news\" and \"a step taken in good faith\". Born in Tel Aviv but raised in New Jersey, 21-year-old Alexander was serving in an elite infantry unit on the border with Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants during the 7 October attack. Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas's 2023 attack, 59 remain in the enclave, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Five of the hostages in Gaza are believed to be US citizens and Alexander was thought to be the only one still alive. Mr Alexander's family said they had \"received the greatest gift imaginable - news that our beautiful son Edan is returning home after 583 days in captivity in Gaza\". We express our deepest gratitude to President Trump, Steve Witkoff, and the US administration for their tireless work to make this happen. We urge the Israeli government and the negotiating teams: please don't stop. We hope our son's release begins negotiations for all 58 remaining hostages, ending this nightmare for them and their families. No hostage should be left behind.\"\n\nGetty Images A picture of Edan Alexander can be seen at a demonstration in Israel calling for the release of the remaining hostages\n\nEgypt and Qatar also released a joint statement saying that Hamas agreeing to free Alexander was an \"encouraging step toward a return to the negotiating table\". In its statement, Hamas said the release was part of efforts to achieve a ceasefire and allow food, medicine and other supplies into Gaza - which has been under a complete blockade by Israel for 70 days. The group said it wanted to reach a final agreement to end the war. The Israeli prime minister's office said in an earlier statement that it had been informed by the US of the Hamas intention to release Alexander \"as a gesture towards the Americans\" and that the move was expected to lead to negotiations on further hostages. Israel's policy was that negotiations would be conducted \"under fire, based on the commitment to achieve all of the objectives of the war\", it added. Hamas has in the past said it will only agree to a deal that includes the end of the war, something that has been repeatedly rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe talks between Hamas and the US are taking place amid multiple reports suggesting growing frustration in the Trump administration with Netanyahu's position. The prime minister is also under pressure at home, with many accusing him of prolonging the war for political purposes. President Donald Trump arrives in the Middle East on Tuesday, and Israel has vowed to expand its military offensive against Hamas if no deal is reached by the end of his visit. Israeli officials have said the plans for their expanded offensive include seizing all of the territory indefinitely, forcibly displacing Palestinians to the south, and taking over aid distribution with private companies despite opposition from the UN and its humanitarian partners, who say they will not co-operate because it appears to \"weaponise\" aid.\n\nReuters Gaza has been under a full Israeli blockade for 70 days\n\nIsrael has already blocked the entry of all food, medication and other humanitarian supplies into Gaza for 70 days, which aid agencies say amounts to a policy of starvation and could be a war crime, and renewed its aerial bombardment and other military operations there in mid-March, which have since killed 2,720 Palestinians according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since the beginning of the year, according to the UN, about 10,000 cases of acute malnutrition among children have been identified. Food prices have rocketed by as much as 1,400%. The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Some 59 are still held captive, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Israel's military campaign has killed 52,829 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "summary": "Earlier a senior Hamas official told the BBC that the Palestinian armed group was holding direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar.\nThe Israeli PM's office said it had not committed to any ceasefire but only to a \"safe corridor\" for Mr Alexander's release.\nBenjamin Netanyahu's office said preparations to intensify fighting were still continuing, and the release of Mr Alexander had been made possible because of military pressure on Hamas.\nPresident Trump confirmed Alexander's release in a post on Truth Social, calling it \"monumental news\" and \"a step taken in good faith\".\nWe hope our son's release begins negotiations for all 58 remaining hostages, ending this nightmare for them and their families.",

    "body": "Trump heads to Saudi Arabia eyeing more investment in US\n\n9 hours ago Share Save Sameer Hashmi Business reporter Reporting from Riyadh Share Save\n\nGetty Images President Trump, pictured here in 2019, is due to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday\n\nWith US President Donald Trump due to visit Gulf states this week, a key focus will be securing significant new investment for the US economy. \"President Trump wants the announcement [of more Gulf money for the US],\" says economist Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank. \"He wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go. And some estimation of what they will do to the American economy in terms of job creation or his big push, of course, on domestic manufacturing.\" Trump is due to arrive in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday 13 May, to meet the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May. The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April. Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico.\n\nGetty Images The Saudi Public Investment Fund owns an 8.4% stake in Uber\n\nSecuring new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his \"America First\" agenda is delivering results. The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton. The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years. Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (\u00a3450bn) in the US over the next years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment. According to Ali Shihabi \u2013 a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government \u2013 a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip. \"These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods,\" says Mr Shihabi.\n\nSaudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment fund (PIF), which controls assets worth $925bn, already has numerous investments in the US. These include Uber, gaming firm Electronic Arts, and electric car firm Lucid. Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington. Yet Ms Young from the Middle East Institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term. She instead says that they are long-term strategic moves, and that the figures should be taken \"with a little bit of a grain of salt\". Regarding specific deals that could be announced during Trump's visit, it is widely reported that Saudi Arabia will agree to buy more than $100bn of US arms and other military items. These are said to include missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft. The US has been a longstanding arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, but in 2021 the then Biden administration stopped selling Riyadh offensive weapons, citing concerns about the country's role in the war in neighbouring Yemen. The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was also widely reported to be a factor. A US report said that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder. The Biden White House resumed the sale of these weapons last year. While it cited that the Saudis had stopped bombing Yemen, some commentators said that the US was seeking Saudi assistance to help end the conflict in Gaza and aid its future reconstruction.\n\nGetty Images Saudi Arabia is investing in construction and infrastructure as it tries to move its economy away from oil\n\nMr Shihabi says Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances from the White House that the US will implement a \"more efficient procurement system\", enabling the Gulf state to access ammunition and military equipment far more quickly and easily. \"The Trump administration is initiating procedures to facilitate those deals. So, it's expected that this process will improve immediately,\" he adds. Artificial intelligence is the other topic that will dominate the agenda during Mr Trump's visit. Talks are expected to centre on attracting greater Gulf investment into US tech firms, and boosting the region's access to cutting-edge American semiconductors. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been investing billions of dollars into tech and AI sectors as try to diversify their economies away from oil. The Emiratis, in particular, are keen to establish themselves as a global AI hub. Last week, the Trump administration scrapped the Biden-era chip regulations that placed restrictions on exports of advanced US chips to more than 120 countries including the Gulf states. The White House is expected to draft new rules that would potentially involve direct negotiations with countries like the UAE. \"For the UAE, this is absolutely essential,\" says Ms Young. \"They are aggressively building out their AI capacity. So, for them getting access to US technology is imperative to be the best.\" While much attention will be on Trump courting Gulf capital for the US, Saudi Arabia is equally focused on drawing American investment into its ambitious Vision 2030 program. Led by giant construction projects, such as the building of a linear city called The Line, Vision 2030 is central to the Saudi government's continuing efforts to diversify the country's economy away from oil. It also involves pouring resources into entertainment, tourism, mining and sports. However, foreign direct investment into Saudi Arabia declined for a third straight year in 2024, reflecting persistent challenges in attracting overseas capital.",

    "title": "Capt Ibrahim Traor\u00e9: Why Burkina Faso's junta leader has captured hearts and minds around the world",
    "body": "Why Burkina Faso's junta leader has captured hearts and minds around the world\n\n10 hours ago Share Save Farouk Chothia BBC News Share Save\n\nIbrahim Traor\u00e9/X\n\nA charismatic 37-year-old, Burkina Faso's military ruler Capt Ibrahim Traor\u00e9 has skilfully built the persona of a pan-Africanist leader determined to free his nation from what he regards as the clutches of Western imperialism and neo-colonialism. His message has resonated across Africa and beyond, with his admirers seeing him as following in the footsteps of African heroes like Burkina Faso's very own Thomas Sankara - a Marxist revolutionary who is sometimes referred to as \"Africa's Che Guevara\". \"Traor\u00e9's impact is huge. I have even heard politicians and authors in countries like Kenya [in East Africa] say: 'This is it. He is the man',\" Beverly Ochieng, a senior researcher at global consultancy firm Control Risks, told the BBC. \"His messages reflect the age we are living in, when many Africans are questioning the relationship with the West, and why there is still so much poverty in such a resource-rich continent,\" she said. After seizing power in a coup in 2022, Traor\u00e9's regime ditched former colonial power France in favour of a strong alliance with Russia, that has included the deployment of a Russian paramilitary brigade, and adopted left-wing economic policies. This included setting up a state-owned mining company, requiring foreign firms to give it a 15% stake in their local operations and to transfer skills to Burkinab\u00e9 people. The rule also applied to Russian miner Nordgold, which was given a licence in late April for its latest investment in Burkina Faso's gold industry. As part of what Traor\u00e9 calls a \"revolution\" to ensure Burkina Faso benefits from its mineral wealth, the junta is also building a gold refinery and establishing national gold reserves for the first time in the nation's history. However, Western-owned firms appear to be facing a tough time, with Australia-headquartered Sarama Resources launching arbitration proceedings against Burkina Faso in late 2024 following the withdrawal of an exploration licence. The junta has also nationalised two gold mines previously owned by a London-listed firm, and said last month that it planned to take control of more foreign-owned mines. Enoch Randy Aikins, a researcher at South Africa's Institute for Security Studies, told the BBC that Traor\u00e9's radical reforms had increased his popularity in Africa. \"He is now arguably Africa's most popular, if not favourite, president,\" Mr Aikins said.\n\nAFP Support for Western-style democracy has fallen in many African states, research shows\n\nHis popularity has been fuelled through social media, including many misleading posts intended to bolster his revolutionary image. AI-generated videos of music stars like R Kelly, Rihanna, Justin Bieber and Beyonc\u00e9 are seen immortalising him through song - though they have done nothing of the sort. Ms Ochieng said that Traor\u00e9 first caught the attention of Africans when he spoke at the Russia-Africa summit in 2023, telling African leaders to \"stop behaving like puppets who dance every time the imperialists pull the strings\". This speech was heavily publicised by Russian media, which has become a major player in promoting Traor\u00e9's pan-Africanist image. Thanks to his rhetoric and pushed by a slick social media campaign, his appeal has spread around the world, including among African-Americans and Black Britons, Ms Ochieng noted. \"Everyone who has experienced racism, colonialism and slavery can relate to his messages,\" Ms Ochieng said, pointing out that African-American rapper Meek Mill had posted about him on X late last year, saying how much he liked his \"energy and heart\" - though he was ridiculed for mixing up names by referring to Traor\u00e9 as Burkina Faso and later deleted the post. But France's president is not a fan, describing Traor\u00e9 as part of a \"baroque alliance between self-proclaimed pan-Africans and neo-imperialists\". Emmanuel Macron was also referring to Russia and China whom he accused, in a 2023 speech, of provoking coups in Africa's former French colonies, and hypocritically stirring up old arguments over sovereignty and colonial exploitation. Traor\u00e9's popularity comes despite the fact that he has failed to fulfil his pledge to quell a 10-year Islamist insurgency that has fuelled ethnic divisions and has now spread to once-peaceful neighbours like Benin. His junta has also cracked down on dissent, including the opposition, media and civil society groups and punished critics, among them medics and magistrates, by sending them to the front-lines of the war against the jihadists.\n\nAFP Thomas Sankara, who was killed in 1987, was praised by supporters for his integrity and selflessness - and remains an icon for many in Africa\n\nFor Rinaldo Depagne, the Africa deputy director of the International Crisis Group think-tank, Traor\u00e9 commands such support because \"he is young in a country with a young population\" - the median age is 17.7 years. \"He is media-savvy, and uses the past to build his popularity as a reincarnation of Sankara,\" he told the BBC. \"And he knows the art of politics - how to make a nation completely traumatised by war feel there is a better future. He is really good at that game.\" Sankara rose to power in a coup in 1983 at the age of 33, rallied the nation under the motto \"Fatherland or death, we will win!\", and was killed four years later in another coup that put Burkina Faso back in France's political orbit until Traor\u00e9's seizure of power. Ghanaian security analyst Prof Kwesi Aning, who previously worked at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre, said the popularity of the military leader reflected a political shift taking place on the continent, especially in West Africa. A 2024 survey in 39 countries by Afrobarometer showed a drop in support for democracy, although it remained the most popular form of government. \"Democracy has failed to give hope to the youth. It has not delivered jobs or better education and health,\" Prof Aning told the BBC. He said Traor\u00e9 was \"offering an alternative, and re-capturing the spirit of two historic epochs\": The post-independence era, when there were leaders like Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia\n\nKenneth Kaunda of Zambia And a later era with Sankara and Ghana's Jerry Rawlings, whose coup in 1979 \"was also very popular at the time\".\n\nIbrahim Traor\u00e9/X Capt Traor\u00e9 is at ease chatting to people - here with agricultural workers in March\n\nIt was Traor\u00e9 who stole the show at the inauguration of Ghana's President John Mahama in January, when he arrived wearing battle fatigues with a pistol in his holster. \"There were already 21 heads of state there, but when Traor\u00e9 walked in, the place lit up. Even my president's bodyguards were running after him,\" Prof Aning said. Traor\u00e9 offered a sharply contrasting image to some of the continent's other leaders, who struggled to walk but clung to power by rigging elections, he said. \"Traor\u00e9 is stylish and confident, with a very open face and a small smile. He is also a powerful orator, and presents himself as a man of the people.\" In a sign that his Russian-allied junta has made some progress on the economic front, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have given a generally upbeat assessment. In a statement in early April, the IMF said that despite a \"challenging humanitarian and security\" environment, the economy was expected to remain \"robust\" in 2025, and the regime had made \"commendable progress\" in raising domestic revenue, containing the public wage bill, and increasing spending on education, health and social protection. As for the World Bank, it said that inflation had surged from 0.7% in 2023 to 4.2% in 2024, but the extreme poverty rate, which refers to people living on less than $2.15 [\u00a31.61] a day, had fallen by almost two percentage points to 24.9% because of \"robust growth\" in the agriculture and services sectors. Despite these reports from US-based financial institutions, relations with both France and America have been frosty. A recent example being the claim by the head of the US Africa Command, Gen Michael Langley, that Traor\u00e9 was using Burkina Faso's gold reserves for his junta's protection rather than the nation's benefit. This appeared to be a reference to the long-standing view of the US, and some of its African allies, that Russian forces were propping up Traor\u00e9 in exchange for a stake in Burkina Faso's gold industry - undermining the military ruler's image as a leader who expelled French troops in 2023 to reclaim the country's sovereignty. Gen Langley's comments, made in early April during a US Senate committee hearing, triggered an uproar among the captain's supporters, who felt their hero was being smeared. This was further inflamed when shortly afterwards, the Burkinab\u00e9 junta said it had foiled a coup plot, alleging the plotters were based in neighbouring Ivory Coast - where Gen Langley then made a visit.\n\nAFP A huge rally in support of Capt Traor\u00e9 was held in Ouagadougou on 30 April - along with others in cities around the world, including London\n\nIvory Coast denied being involved in any plot, while the US Africa Command said Gen Langley's visit had focused on addressing \"common security challenges\" - including \"violent extremism\". But the junta took the opportunity to organise one of its biggest rallies in Burkina Faso's capital over fears that \"imperialists\" and their \"lackeys\" were trying to depose the captain. \"Because Colin Powell lied, Iraq was destroyed. Barack Obama lied, Gaddafi was killed. But this time, their lies won't affect us,\" one protester, musician Ocibi Johann, told the Associated Press news agency. Rallies in solidarity with Traor\u00e9 were also held abroad, including in London, on the same day. He took to social media afterwards, posting in French and English, to express his gratitude to them for sharing his vision \"for a new Burkina Faso and a new Africa\", adding: \"Together, in solidarity, we will defeat imperialism and neo-colonialism for a free, dignified and sovereign Africa.\" It is impossible to say how things will end for the young captain, but he - along with military leaders in Mali and Niger - have certainly shaken up West Africa, and other states have followed their example by ordering French forces to leave. The three military-ruled neighbours have also pulled out of the regional trade and security grouping Ecowas, formed their own alliance, and have ended free trade in the region by announcing the imposition of a 0.5% tariff on goods coming into their countries. Mr Aikins said Traor\u00e9 could learn from others, pointing out that when Rawlings took power in Ghana at the age of 32, he was known as \"Junior Jesus\" but after 19 years he left a mixed legacy - he had been unable to stem corruption despite helping to create an \"enduring\" democracy. For a \"lasting legacy\", Mr Aikins said, Traor\u00e9 should focus on achieving peace and building strong state institutions to bring about good governance rather than \"personalising\" power and cracking down on dissent.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

The Ukrainian leader might have been expected to slam his opposite number in Moscow for not committing to a 30-day ceasefire, as demanded by Kyiv and its Western allies on Saturday. Instead, writing on X, Zelensky called it \"a positive sign that the Russians have finally begun to consider ending the war\". Zelensky added that Ukraine expected Russia to confirm it would abide by the proposed 30-day ceasefire, starting on Monday. It's hard to tell if Zelensky really sees Putin's offer of direct talks as a \"positive sign\". This is as much about optics as anything else. Neither Putin nor Zelensky want to be seen by US President Donald Trump as the obstacle to peace. Trump's reaction was markedly upbeat. Writing on his Truth Social platform earlier, he hinted once again that this war was close to ending.

    "body": "The U.S. and China announce a deal to cut tariffs, temporarily easing trade war\n\ntoggle caption Andy Wong/AP\n\nGENEVA, Switzerland \u2014 The U.S. and China have agreed to significantly reduce tariffs imposed just weeks before on each other's goods, after negotiators from both countries met over the weekend for trade talks in Switzerland, adding yet another dramatic turn in a dispute that has roiled financial markets and rocked the global economy in recent weeks.\n\nAmerican levies on Chinese goods will drop from at least 145% to a base levy of 30% for an initial period 90 days, while Chinese levies are set to fall from at least 125% to 10% on American goods.\n\nThe talks were led on the Chinese side by Vice Premier He Lifeng and on the U.S. side by Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\n\"We concluded that we have shared interest and we both have an interest in balanced trade,\" Bessent said at a press conference on Monday. Greer also said there was a \"positive path forward\" on the two countries working to address fentanyl smuggling.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe new American tariff levels reflect a base 10% tariff that remains on all imports in addition to a total 20% tariff president Trump imposed earlier this year to punish Beijing for what the U.S. says is fentanyl-related chemicals being made in China.\n\n\"China has always pursuing win-win outcomes in its trade and economic negotiations, and therefore any possible deal to be reached will definitely by in the development interest of China's own,\" said Li Chenggang, a diplomat with China's commerce ministry.\n\nThe delegations praised each other after the negotiations.\n\nVice Premier He described the atmosphere of the meeting as \"candid, in-depth, and constructive\" at a press conference following the meeting, saying it achieved \"substantial progress and reached important consensus\".\n\nThe Chinese \"came to deal this week,\" said Greer, citing rapid progress between the two countries, which have also agreed to establish a consultation mechanism to continue addressing trade issues going forward.\n\n\"Neither side wants a decoupling,\" said Bessent \"We do want trade, we want more balanced trade, and I think both sides are committed to achieving that.\"\n\nThe previous eye-watering tariff rates, which ratcheted up throughout April with retaliatory tariffs on both sides, had effectively paralyzed trade between the world's two largest economies and shocked consumers and small businesses in the U.S. who suddenly saw their orders in China more than double in price. While welcome by importers, the tariff drops are temporary and could be pulled if talks between the two countries sour.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"While the Chamber is encouraged by the decision, uncertainty remains,\" said Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. \"Businesses need predictability to maintain normal operations and make investment decisions.\"\n\nThe U.S. says it is now negotiating for China to purchase more American goods, a throwback to a trade deal the Trump administration negotiated with China during another trade war in 2020.

    "body": "Zelenskyy challenges Putin to meet him in Turkey 'personally' for ceasefire talks\n\ntoggle caption Mstyslav Chernov/AP\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday challenged Russia's President Vladimir Putin to meet him personally in Turkey on Thursday, the latest move in a weekend-long exchange of proposals from both sides on the next steps in the U.S.-led peace effort.\n\nZelenskyy said that he still hopes for a ceasefire with Russia starting Monday, and that he will \"be waiting for Putin\" in Turkey \"personally\" after U.S. President Donald Trump insisted Ukraine accept Russia's latest offer \u2014 to hold direct talks in Turkey on Thursday. Ukraine, along with European allies, had demanded Russia accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting Monday before holding talks, but Moscow effectively rejected the proposal and called for direct negotiations instead.\n\nIt was not clear if Zelenskyy was conditioning his presence in Turkey on the Monday ceasefire holding, and there was no immediate comment from the Kremlin on whether Putin would go. In 2022, the war's early months, Zelenskyy repeatedly called for a personal meeting with the Russian president but was rebuffed, and eventually enacted a decree declaring that holding negotiations with Putin had become impossible.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy. There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in (Turkey) on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X on Sunday.\n\nTrump said in a social media post earlier Sunday that Ukraine should agree to Putin's peace talks proposal \"IMMEDIATELY.\"\n\n\"At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the U.S., will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!\" Trump wrote, adding: \"HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!\"\n\nUkraine, allies insist on a ceasefire\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Saturday and issued a coordinated call for a 30-day truce starting Monday. The plan has received backing from both the European Union and Trump.\n\nThe leaders pledged tougher sanctions on Russia if Putin did not accept the proposal.\n\nPutin in remarks to the media overnight effectively rejected the offer and proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday instead \"without preconditions.\" He did not specify whether the talks on Thursday would involve Zelenskyy and himself personally.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHe said a ceasefire might be agreed on during the negotiations \u2014 but stressed that the Kremlin needs a truce that would lead to a \"lasting peace\" instead of one that would allow Ukraine to rearm and mobilize more men into its armed forces.\n\nZelenskyy said on X on Sunday morning that it was a \"positive sign that the Russians have finally begun to consider ending the war,\" but insisted on a ceasefire first.\n\nPutin and Zelenskyy have only met once \u2014 in 2019. After repeated unsuccessful calls for a personal meeting with the Russian leader early on in the war, and following the Kremlin's decision in September 2022 to illegally annex four regions of Ukraine, Zelenskyy enacted a decree declaring that holding negotiations with Putin had become impossible.\n\nMacron said Sunday that Putin's offer of direct negotiations with Ukraine is \"a first step, but not enough,\" signaling continued Western skepticism toward Moscow's intentions.\n\n\"An unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations,\" Macron told reporters at the Polish-Ukrainian border, according to French media, adding that Putin is \"looking for a way out, but he still wants to buy time.\"\n\nMoscow presses on with peace talks offer. Turkey says it's ready to host\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in comments aired by Russian state TV on Sunday, called Putin's proposal \"very serious,\" aimed at eliminating \"the root causes of the conflict,\" and said it \"confirms a real intention to find a peaceful solution.\"\n\nWithout directly mentioning Moscow's proposal, Trump said in a social media post several hours after Putin's overnight remarks that it was \"a potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!\"\n\n\"Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending 'bloodbath' hopefully comes to an end,\" Trump wrote. \"I will continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens. The USA wants to focus, instead, on Rebuilding and Trade. A BIG week upcoming!\" he added.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn another post on Sunday, the U.S. president said Ukraine should accept Putin's offer \"to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH.\" He added, however, that he was \"starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin.\"\n\nPutin spoke Sunday to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who expressed readiness to host the talks, the Kremlin said.\n\nAccording to the Kremlin's readout of the phone call, Erdogan \"fully supported the Russian proposal\" and was ready to provide a platform for the talks and assistance in organizing them.\n\nIn a separate phone call to Macron on Sunday, Erdogan said that a \"historic turning point\" had been reached in efforts to end the war, according to a statement from the Turkish presidential communications office.\n\nQuestions over next steps persist as attacks continue\n\nZelenskyy in his nightly video address on Sunday said he still expected a ceasefire to take hold on Monday, and that he was still waiting for a \"clear answer\" from Russia about it.\n\nZelenskyy said he was also waiting to see reaction from Western allies who on Saturday promised robust sanctions against Russia if Putin did not abide by the Monday truce.\n\n\"We have repeatedly heard from partners that they are ready to strengthen sanctions against Russia if Putin refuses a ceasefire. We will see,\" he said.\n\nHe reiterated he would be present in Turkey on Thursday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not immediately respond to a message from The Associated Press asking for a comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia resumed mass drone attacks in Ukraine early on Sunday, after its self-declared three-day pause expired.\n\nRussia launched 108 attack drones and simulator drones from six different directions, Ukraine's air force said. It said 60 drones were shot down and another 41 simulator drones failed to reach targets due to Ukrainian countermeasures.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday accused Ukraine of \"violating\" Moscow's three-day ceasefire more than 14,000 times. Ukraine, which did not agree to the May 8-10 ceasefire, has also accused Russia of violating its own truce, with the Ukrainian foreign minister calling it a farce.\n\nA Russian official on Sunday evening also accused Ukrainian forces of a missile strike on a town in Russia's Kursk region that borders Ukraine. Acting Gov. Alexander Khinshtein said on Telegram that the strike \"seriously damaged\" a hotel in Rylsk, a town east of the Ukrainian border, and wounded three people.\n\n",

It hasn't stopped him from running for mayor of his southern Davao city stronghold.\n\nUnder Philippine law, candidates facing criminal charges, including those in detention, can run for office unless they have been convicted and have exhausted all appeals.\n\nDuterte is widely expected to win as Davao mayor, a position he held for over two decades before becoming president. It's less clear how he can practically serve as mayor from behind bars.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOver 68 million Filipinos have registered to vote Monday for half of the 24-member Senate, all the 317 seats in the House of Representatives and various positions in provinces, cities and municipalities. The spotlight is on the race for the Senate that could determine the political future of Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte.\n\nShe faces an impeachment trial in the Senate in July over accusations of plotting to assassinate President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and corruption involving her office's intelligence funds. She has denied the allegations, saying they were spread by her political opponents to destroy her.\n\nSara Duterte is considered a strong contender for the 2028 presidential race. But if convicted by the Senate, she will be removed as vice president and disqualified from holding public office. To be acquitted, she needs at least nine of 24 senators to vote in her favor.\n\n\"The 2025 midterm elections will be crucial, because the results will set the pace for what will happen next, which family or faction will dominate the elections in 2028,\" said Maria Ela Atienza, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines.\n\nIf Sara Duterte is convicted in the impeachment trial, it could signal the end of the Duterte family holding key positions in the country, she said. Other family members running in the election include Rodrigo Duterte's youngest son, Sebastian, the incumbent mayor of Davao who is now running for vice mayor. His eldest son Paolo is seeking reelection as a member of the House of Representatives. Two grandsons are also running in local races.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe impeachment and Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and transfer to the tribunal in The Hague came after Marcos and Sara Duterte's ties unraveled over political differences and their competing ambitions.\n\n\"This election will decide the future of our country,\" Sara Duterte said in a rally in Manila last week, where she campaigned for the family-backed senatorial candidates and criticized the Marcos administration. \"Your vote will decide if we can continue reforms or continue to slide to our doom.\"\n\nHer father's spiritual adviser and close political ally, televangelist Apollo Quiboloy, is also running for a Senate seat despite being detained on charges of sexual abuse and human trafficking. He is also wanted in the U.S. on similar charges.\n\nThe vote will last until 7 p.m. Monday. Some voters complained their names were missing from the list of voters in their precinct, while others grumbled about the long queue amid the stifling heat.\n\nVoter Reymark Marquez said the Marcos-Duterte team that won in 2022 failed to deliver on promises. He said the midterm elections are \"beyond Duterte versus Marcos but about choosing the right leaders.\"\n\n\"I think what is at stake in this election is the future of the next generation,\" Diana Joy Acosta, a 32-year-old new mother, said after casting her vote in a school in metropolitan Manila's Mandaluyong City. For her baby's future, she hopes for an end to corruption and the election of politicians with integrity.",

Left untreated, the parasitic infection can kill a full-grown cow within one to two weeks.\n\nEfforts to get rid of the pest go back many decades.\n\nIn fact, the U.S and Mexico were able to eradicate the New World screwworm in the 1960s and '70s by releasing hundreds of millions of sterile adult flies that would mate with the females \u2014 ultimately preventing them from laying viable eggs.\n\nThis strategy helped create a \"barrier zone\" that kept the pest from encroaching into the U.S. and Mexico, though cases would still pop up from time to time.\n\nIn 1976, an outbreak in Texas affected more than 1.4 million cattle and hundreds of thousands of sheep and goats. If such an outbreak were to occur now, it's estimated that would cost the Texas economy $1.8 billion, according to a USDA analysis.\n\nThe potential fallout is why agricultural officials are so alarmed that the pest has made a comeback in the last few years.\n\nCases have surged in parts of Central America and are now being detected in some \"remote farms\" in Mexico about 700 miles from the U.S border, the USDA said on Sunday.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs a result, the U.S. shut down live animal trade on the border in November. That was lifted in February after the U.S and Mexico agreed on new measures to keep the parasite at bay.\n\nThe new ban will continue on a \"month-by-month basis, until a significant window of containment is achieved,\" according to the USDA.",

He is the last remaining American citizen held by Hamas in Gaza who is believed to still be alive. The bodies of four other Americans are still held in Gaza, according to the U.S.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn the statement, Hamas said it had been holding secret talks with the U.S. for the last several days, and that Alexander \"will be released as part of the steps taken to establish a ceasefire.\" It said his release would come as part of ceasefire efforts to open Gaza's border crossings and bring aid to Gaza after more than 10 weeks of an Israeli blockade that international humanitarian groups say is driving rampant hunger in the territory.\n\nPresident Trump took to social media on Sunday to confirm the agreement with Hamas on Alexander's release, saying that it was made to \"put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.\"\n\nIsraeli officials have not yet commented publicly on whether they were aware of the talks, but a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the U.S. had \"informed Israel of Hamas's intention to release soldier Edan Alexander as a goodwill gesture to the Americans, without any conditions or compensation.\" It said Israel is \"preparing for the possibility\" of his release.\n\nEarlier this year, both Hamas and the U.S. confirmed that the two parties had been holding direct talks starting as early as January \u2014 in a major shift in American policy, as the U.S. had not engaged directly with Hamas since it designated it a terrorist organization in 1997. It has been a long-standing U.S. policy to not negotiate with groups it designates as terrorists.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nQatar and Egypt \u2014 two countries who have played key roles in negotiation efforts between Israel and Hamas throughout the war, along with the U.S. \u2014 issued a joint announcement welcoming the release of Alexander, calling it a \"encouraging step\" toward a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nThe announcement about Alexander's possible release comes shortly before Trump departs for the region to visit Arab allies in the Gulf on Monday, in his first overseas trip during his second term. He is not expected to visit Israel, but is expected to discuss the future of Gaza with Arab leaders.\n\nHamas has not yet said when Alexander would be released, although Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, told NBC news on Sunday that he is traveling to Israel, and \"picking him up probably tomorrow.\" He said the release was happening largely because of President Trump. Witkoff's office did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.\n\nThere are 59 hostages remaining in Gaza, including Alexander, more than half of whom are believed to be dead, according to Israel. Hamas had released 38 hostages in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel under a ceasefire deal that began on Jan. 19. But Israel's military broke that ceasefire in March, after negotiations between the two parties failed to produce an extension of the truce.\n\nIsrael has since gained control of about a third of Gaza's territory, and has imposed a complete blockade while continuing a deadly and destructive air campaign throughout. Earlier this month it said it planned to expand its offensive there.\n\nGaza health authorities say more than 52,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks on the territory since the start of the war in October 2023. About 1,200 people in Israel were killed in the Hamas-led attacks that month and some 250 people were taken hostage, according to Israel.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nKat Lonsdorf reported from Washington, D.C., and Daniel Estrin reported from Tel Aviv.

Huh/AP\n\nWhen Catholics across the U.S. attended Sunday services this weekend, it was the first time in history they had done so with an American pope sitting in the Vatican.\n\nOn Thursday, the College of Cardinals selected Chicago-born Robert Prevost to lead the church of some 1.4 billion adherents worldwide. He took the name Pope Leo XIV.\n\nSome U.S. Catholics took particular pride in the election of the first American pontiff, who has familial ties to multiple places across the country.\n\nOn Sunday, New Orleans resident Meaghan Gibson said Pope Leo seems \"very down to Earth\" and that she was excited by his election \u2014 even more because members of his family once lived in the city.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The fact that his family comes from New Orleans is amazing,\" Gibson, 37, told NPR member station WWNO's Rosemary Westwood. \"Hopefully he will grace us with his presence sometime during his papacy.\"\n\nLeo's grandparents Joseph and Louise Martinez lived in New Orleans before moving to Chicago sometime between 1910 and 1912, according to the Historic New Orleans Collection. Their home sat on a plot of land that was later taken to build a highway, the museum and research center discovered.\n\n\"So possibly if that had not been built, the family might've still been here,\" Gibson said. \"It's very amazing to see that happen and know his grandparents got married just down the street from our home church.\"\n\nAngie Spencer, who was attending services at St. Mary of the Purification Catholic Church in Houston on Sunday, told The Texas Newsroom's Lucio Vasquez that there's a lot of enthusiasm surrounding the election of the first American pontiff.\n\n\"I have a little grandson. He just told me in church today, 'You know what, grandma? I'm going to be a priest and then I'm going to be a bishop and then I'm going to be a pope,'\" Spencer said. \"Even he's catching onto it.\"\n\nShe said she hoped Leo would continue some of the work of his predecessor, Pope Francis, such as reaching out to the poor and trying to unify people across the world.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSpencer, who is 74, said with a laugh that she's \"seen a lot of popes!\" She added: \"Pope Francis I loved, and Pope Leo will follow right along in his footsteps and do even greater things.\"\n\nAt Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago on Sunday, people took selfies in front of a billboard congratulating Pope Leo \u2014 a city native \u2014 on his papal election, according to Chicago Public Media's Jake Wittich.\n\nChicago resident Sara Schroeder said it was a historic moment for the country and for the city. \"Mass was beautiful,\" Schroeder said. \"The priest was very happy about Pope Leo. People were cheering that he's from Chicago, and people would clap anytime that was mentioned.\"\n\nSchroeder's daughter, Caitlin Thigpen, added: \"It's like he's the hometown hero.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the evening mass at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C., turned into a thanksgiving for the new pope, WAMU's Jackson Sinnenberg reported.\n\n\"As he begins his pontificate,\" said Father Isaac Sagastume, \"may the universal church receive its new pastor with joy and a renewed sense of missionary zeal.\"",

    "body": "The U.S. has a plan for getting food into Gaza. Top aid groups object to the idea\n\ntoggle caption Abdel Kareem Hana/AP\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 On the eve of President Trump's visit to Arab allies in the Gulf, the U.S. and Israel have announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies back into Gaza after a ten-week Israeli ban that aid workers say is driving rampant hunger in the territory.\n\nIt is the result of pressure by the Trump administration on Israel to allow aid back into Gaza, according to a person familiar with the details who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal diplomacy.\n\nThe proposed solution would only provide food and aid to around 60 percent of Gaza's civilians initially, according to a copy of the proposal reviewed by NPR. Key details remain unresolved, like who would run it or pay for it.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe program is an about-face from Israel's earlier policy to withhold aid to pressure Hamas to free Israeli hostages. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee says Israel is fully on board with the new proposal.\n\n\"President Trump has made very clear that one of the most urgent things that needs to happen is humanitarian aid into Gaza, and he has tasked all of his team to do everything possible to accelerate that and to as expeditiously as possible get humanitarian aid in, to the people,\" said Huckabee in a press conference Friday.\n\ntoggle caption Jehad Alshrafi/AP\n\nWhat the new aid plan would look like\n\nGaza's population would be forced to move south in order to receive aid in a new zone cordoned off by Israel's military, to prevent Hamas members from access, an Israeli defense official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity to divulge details.\n\nAccording to a 14-page proposal reviewed by NPR, a private charity recently registered in Switzerland called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation would establish four aid distribution sites and hand out pre-packaged food, hygiene kits and medical supplies.\n\nIsrael's foreign minister, Gideon Saar, publicly endorsed the U.S. plan Sunday and called on countries and aid groups to cooperate.\n\n\"It will enable aid to go directly to the people. Hamas must not be allowed to get their hands on it,\" Saar said. Israeli soldiers \"will not allocate aid. They will secure the perimeter.\"\n\nIsrael says Hamas has taken advantage of aid deliveries, seizing supplies, profiting from black market sales, and using aid distribution to assert its control of Gaza. U.N. officials say there is no large-scale diversion of aid in Gaza.\n\n\"The aid we coordinate goes to the people for whom it's intended,\" said Olga Cherevko of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \"We have mechanisms in place that help mitigate this, including monitoring during and after distribution, hotlines to report incidents and our accountability to donors.\"\n\nIsrael says it will first wait for Trump to finish his trip this week to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to allow the chance for a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas.\n\nIf no deal emerges by then, Israel vows to begin to roll out this plan, combined with intensified military ground operations and the seizure of more territory in Gaza.\n\ntoggle caption Jehad Alshrafi/AP\n\nMany of the plan's details are still unresolved\n\nAccording to the written proposal, the four initial aid distribution sites would serve a combined total of 1.2 million Palestinians. That is only about 60 percent of the estimated 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. Huckabee said the aid distribution would be scaled up to serve larger populations.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe main aid organizations working in Gaza are refusing to cooperate with the proposal, as presented by Israeli officials to the U.N. and its aid partners. Humanitarian groups say they cannot work with a program that refuses aid to anyone seeking it, even belligerents.\n\n\"It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2014 as part of a military strategy,\" the United Nations and its aid partners in Gaza said in a joint statement. \"We will not participate in any scheme that does not adhere to the global humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.\"\n\nThe U.S. says it is still in talks with aid professionals to finalize who would run the program. Huckabee said he did not have the details on who would fund the program, but cited some contributors who wish to remain unnamed.\n\ntoggle caption Jehad Alshrafi/AP\n\nWhy humanitarian aid groups oppose the program\n\nThe proposed U.S. aid program for Gaza would be a significant departure from the established U.N.-led system that has long been the cornerstone of humanitarian response in conflict zones, aid experts say.\n\nIt would skirt the already-existing system for aid delivery, replacing around 400 U.N. distribution points across Gaza with just around four distribution points, which experts say would overwhelm the system and make it hard to ensure fair distribution to hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nIt would advance Israel's plans to coerce Palestinians to move from north to south Gaza on Egypt's border, with eventual plans for the migration of Palestinians out of Gaza. Those are Israeli military strategies that humanitarian organizations do not want to endorse.\n\nIn the Iraq war, private security groups provided aid to civilians within the parameters of the Iraqi military, leading to ethical concerns, aid experts say.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The idea of getting aid is very important, but how aid is delivered is equally important. And there are massive red flags all over the place for this plan,\" said Paul Spiegel, director of the center for humanitarian health at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nNPR's Fatma Tanis reported from Washington, D.C.",

Part of a new peace initiative with Ankara designed to end four decades of violence, the announcement follows a call in February by jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan for the PKK to lay down its arms.\n\nFollowing a party congress in northern Iraq that ended on Friday, the group said it had reached \u201chistoric\u201d decisions that would be shared with the public soon.\n\nFirat reported that a statement by Ocalan outlining his \u201cperspectives and proposals\u201d was read during the congress.\n\nIn a statement carried by Firat on Monday, the PKK announced that its armed struggle had successfully challenged policies that sought to suppress Kurdish rights.\n\nThe PKK has \u201ccompleted its historical mission\u201d, it read, and \u201cthe 12th PKK Congress has decided to dissolve the PKK\u2019s organisational structure and end its method of armed struggle\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a result, activities carried out under the name \u2018PKK\u2019 were formally terminated,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAccording to Turkiye\u2019s state news agency Anadolu, a spokesperson for Turkiye\u2019s governing AK Party said: \u201cIf the new PKK decision is fully implemented, shutting down all PKK branches, illegal structures, it will be a turning point.\u201d\n\nShifting regional sands\n\nThe announcement signals the potential end of a conflict that has plagued the region, spilling over into northern Iraq and Syria.\n\nIn February, Ocalan \u2013 who has been in jail since 1999 \u2013 called on the group to lay down its arms and dissolve itself in a bid to end the hostilities, which have claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1980s.\n\nThe PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkiye and most Western states, announced a ceasefire days later, but set conditions to disband, including the establishment of a legal mechanism for peace talks.\n\nThe group said the Kurdish people would embrace peace and a democratic process, and \u201cwill understand the decision to dissolve the PKK and end the armed struggle method better than anyone else\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Kurdish political parties, democratic organisations and opinion leaders will fulfil their responsibilities in developing Kurdish democracy and ensuring the formation of a Kurdish democratic nation.\u201d\n\nThe announcement by the PKK comes against a backdrop of major changes in the region, including a new administration in Syria, the weakening of the Hezbollah armed group in Lebanon and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent years, the PKK had been limited to isolated attacks inside T\u00fcrkiye as the military pushed its fighters across the mountainous border into Iraq.\n\nThe latest peace initiative was launched in October by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli. The far-right politician suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole if the PKK renounces violence and disbands.\n\nIn late February, Erdogan described the group\u2019s potential dissolution as a \u201chistoric opportunity to advance towards the objective of destroying the wall of terror\u201d.\n\nThe future of PKK fighters remains uncertain, including whether they may be relocated to third countries. Any concessions the PKK might obtain in exchange for its decision to disband have not been disclosed.",

The attack never came.\n\nWhether these erratic actions are a reaction to the announced US ceasefire remains to be seen, but many analysts have spoken of a widening rift between Netanyahu and Trump.\n\nNetanyahu has reportedly expressed his frustration with Trump\u2019s Middle East policy in private conversations.\n\nHe has been publicly against the US administration\u2019s talks with Iran, claiming there is no diplomatic way to resolve differences with Tehran, yet Iran and the US have continued their talks.\n\nHe went on to blame Iran for the Houthis\u2019 attacks, claiming Israel\u2019s attacks are a message to the \u201cHouthis\u2019 sponsors\u201d.\n\nTrump, for his part, has seemed unconcerned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting Trump didn\u2019t say anything about [Houthi] attacks on Israel, which seem to be continuing amid this escalation,\u201d Nicholas Brumfield, a Yemen analyst, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIn [this] case, it\u2019s a US drawdown because the Houthis haven\u2019t been attacking international shipping,\u201d Brumfield said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been attacking Israel. The US has been doing its thing, and the Houthis have been targeting US ships.\u201d\n\nAfter Israeli attacks on Monday and Tuesday, which killed at least three people and wounded 35 others and damaged Hodeidah Port and Sanaa Airport, the Houthis promised retaliation.\n\nThe attacks \u201cwill not go unanswered\u201d, the Houthi political bureau said in a statement.\n\nThat kind of statement is typical of the Houthis, who have managed to weather more than a decade of attacks by forces with far superior military capabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAir strikes by the US and United Kingdom on Yemen in early 2024 were unable to stop the Houthis\u2019 attacks on Red Sea traffic.\n\nYears of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition supporting Yemen\u2019s internationally recognised government taught the Houthis to keep their military infrastructure agile, analysts told Al Jazeera.\n\nA senior US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera that recent US attacks on the Houthis have pushed leaders underground after the killing of some key military commanders.\n\nHowever, unlike under US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, the attacks under Trump have been indiscriminate and have led to more civilian deaths. More than 250 people have been killed by US attacks on Yemen since mid-March, including at least 68 people at a centre housing detained African refugees and migrants in late April.\n\nExperts told Al Jazeera that despite the increased ferocity of those attacks, the Houthis have not been deterred.\n\n\u201cThe Houthis aren\u2019t going to stop,\u201d Brumfield said.\n\nIsrael still striking\n\nThe Houthis have made their stance clear vis-\u00e0-vis the agreement with the US and the continuation of attacks on Israel, which has also made clear that it plans to keep attacking.\n\n\u201cThe stated aim is to deter [the Houthis] or deplete their military capabilities to the point that the Houthis cannot target Israel any more, but these are both very unrealistic goals,\u201d Hannah Porter, an independent Yemen analyst, told Al Jazeera.\n\nIsrael already considers that it has diminished the capabilities of two of its biggest foes, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, over the past 19 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut trying something like that on the Houthis would be a vastly different challenge, she said.\n\n\u201cIsrael has probably not gathered the amount of intel on the Houthis that they have on Hamas or Hezbollah, so tracking and targeting leaders will be harder,\u201d Porter said.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, the geographic area is much larger in northern Yemen, meaning that there are far more potential targets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe terrain is a factor, too,\u201d she added. \u201cNorthern Yemen is very mountainous with plenty of places to hide people and weapons.\u201d\n\nFor now, Israel and the Houthis seem intent on continuing their exchange of attacks. And the first to suffer will be the people of Yemen.\n\nIsrael struck numerous targets in recent days in Yemen, including Sanaa\u2019s airport and the port in Hodeidah, which experts said is likely to exacerbate Yemen\u2019s dire humanitarian situation.\n\nIsrael destroyed at least three civilian planes in the attacks.\n\nYemen is already suffering one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises. More than 18.2 million people require humanitarian assistance and protection services, according to the United Nations.\n\nMore than 17.1 million Yemenis suffer acute food shortages, and about five million are on the brink of famine.\n\nWhile analysts said Israel\u2019s attacks on ports will not be a \u201cknockout blow\u201d, they are among a matrix of factors that leave many Yemenis in an increasingly precarious position.\n\n\u201cThe humanitarian situation will just get worse,\u201d Raiman Al-Hamdani, a Yemen researcher with the international development company ARK, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDestroying the two main ports of northern Yemen, where the majority of the population lives, coupled with the FTO [\u201cforeign terrorist organisation\u201d] designation with cuts to the aid system around the world and the deteriorating economy \u2026 is a recipe for [unprecedented] humanitarian disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Israel\u2019s attacks] are a continuation of its strategy. It\u2019s out of spite, targets civil infrastructure and the policy of creating human suffering,\u201d Al-Hamdani said.\n\nBoth sides seem unwilling to stop, however.\n\n\u201cI cannot see anything quite good coming out of this unless the war Israel is waging on Gaza comes to some form of truce,\u201d Al-Hamdani said.",

    "body": "The region, which faced the brunt of the India-Pakistan military escalation, limps back to life. But questions remain.\n\nSrinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir \u2014 On Saturday morning at Fateh Kadal, a densely packed neighbourhood on the sloping embankment of the Jhelum River in Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s largest city, 62-year-old Hajira wrapped a cotton scarf with a brown paisley design around her shoulders.\n\nWith her face muscles tense and sweat beading across her upper lip, she sat on the cement floor of a government-run grains store.\n\n\u201cCan you make it quick?\u201d she called to the person manning the store.\n\nHajira comes to the store every month to submit her biometric details, as required by the government to secure the release of her monthly quota of subsidised grains, which her family of four depends on.\n\nBut this time was different. The past few days have been unprecedented for residents of Indian-administered Kashmir. Drones hovered overhead, airports were shut down, explosions rang out, people were killed in cross-border fire, and the region prepared for the possibility of an all-out war.\n\n\u201cHe made me stand in the queue,\u201d she said, flinching from knee pain, referring to the store operator. \u201cBut there\u2019s uncertainty around. I just want my share of rice so I can quickly return. A war is coming.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, on Saturday evening, Hajira breathed a sigh of relief. United States President Donald Trump announced that he had succeeded in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.\n\n\u201cI thank God for this,\u201d Hajira said, smiling sheepishly. \u201cPerhaps he understood that I didn\u2019t have the means to endure the financial hardship that a war-like situation would have caused.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday morning, Trump went a step further, saying in a post on his Truth Social platform that he would try to work with India and Pakistan to resolve their longstanding dispute over Kashmir, a region both countries partly control but claim in its entirety.\n\nPolitical analyst Zafar Choudhary, based in the city of Jammu in southern Kashmir, told Al Jazeera that New Delhi would not be happy about Trump\u2019s statement. India has long argued that Pakistan-sponsored \u201cterrorism\u201d is the primary reason for tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.\n\nHowever, \u201cTrump\u2019s offer underlines the fact that Kashmir remains central to India-Pakistan confrontations\u201d, Choudhary said.\n\nAnd for Kashmiris, the hope stemming from the fragile pause in fighting between India and Pakistan, and Trump\u2019s offer to mediate talks on Kashmir, is tempered by scepticism borne from a decades-long, desperate wait for peace.\n\n\u2018Never been more frightened\u2019\n\nHundreds of thousands of Kashmiris stood in the direct line of fire between India and Pakistan in recent days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the neighbouring nations launched missiles and drones at each other, Kashmiri communities near the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border with Pakistan, also witnessed cross-border shelling on a scale unseen in decades, triggering an exodus of people towards safer locations.\n\nThe shadow of conflict has stalked their lives for nearly four decades, since an armed rebellion first erupted against the Indian government in the late 1980s. Then, in 2019, the government scrapped Kashmir\u2019s semi-autonomous status amid a huge security crackdown \u2013 thousands of people were imprisoned.\n\nOn April 22, a brutal attack by gunmen on tourists at Pahalgam killed 26 civilians, shattering the normalcy critics had accused India of projecting in the disputed region.\n\nSince then, in addition to a diplomatic tit-for-tat and missile exchanges with Pakistan, the Indian government has intensified its crackdown on the armed groups active in Kashmir.\n\nIt has demolished the homes of rebels accused of links to the Pahalgam attack, raided other homes across the region and detained approximately 2,800 people, 90 of whom have been booked under the Public Safety Act, a draconian preventive detention law. The police also summoned many journalists and arrested at least one for \u201cpromoting secessionist ideology\u201d.\n\nBy Sunday, while a sense of jubilation swept through the region over the ceasefire, many people were still cautious, doubtful even, about whether the truce brokered by Trump would hold.\n\nJust hours after both countries declared a cessation of hostilities, loud explosions rang out in major urban centres across Kashmir as a swarm of kamikaze drones from Pakistan raced across the airspace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany residents raced to the terraces of their apartments and homes to capture videos of the drones being brought down by India\u2019s defence systems, a trail of bright red dots arcing across the night sky before exploding midair.\n\nAs part of the emergency protocols, the authorities turned off the electricity supply. Fearing that the debris from drones would fall on them, residents ran for safety. The surge of drones through the night skies also touched off sirens, triggering a sense of dread.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever been more frightened before,\u201d said Hasnain Shabir, a 24-year-old business graduate from Srinagar. \u201cThe streets have been robbed of all their life. If the prelude to war looks like this, I don\u2019t know what war will look like.\u201d\n\nA fragile ceasefire\n\nHours after the ceasefire was announced on Saturday, India accused Pakistan of violating it by shelling border regions. Residents across major towns in Kashmir were on their toes, once again, after drones reappeared in the skies.\n\nOne of the worst-affected places in Kashmir during these days is Uri, a picturesque town of pear orchards and walnut groves close to India\u2019s contested border with Pakistan.\n\nThe village is surrounded by majestic mountains through which the Jhelum flows. It is the final frontier on the Indian-administered side before the hills pave the way to Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParts of Uri saw intense shelling, forcing the residents to leave their homes and look for safety. On May 8, officials told Al Jazeera that a woman, Nargis Bashir, was killed in her car as she and her family tried to flee the border region, like thousands of others, after flying shrapnel tore through the vehicle. Three of her family members were wounded.\n\nMuhammad Naseer Khan, 60, a former serviceman, was huddling in his room when Pakistani artillery fire hit a nearby military post, with metal shards blasting through the walls of his house. \u201cThe blast has damaged one side of my home,\u201d Khan said, wearing a traditional blue shirt and a tweed coat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this place is even liveable,\u201d he said, his bright blue eyes betraying a sense of fear.\n\nDespite the ceasefire, his two daughters and many others in his family who had left for a relative\u2019s house, away from the disputed border, are sceptical about returning. \u201cMy children are refusing to return. They have no guarantee that guns won\u2019t roar again,\u201d he said.\n\nSuleman Sheikh, a 28-year-old resident in Uri, recalled his childhood years when his grandfather would talk about the Bofors artillery guns stationed inside a military garrison in the nearby village of Mohra.\n\n\u201cHe told us that the last time this gun had roared was in 1999, when India and Pakistan clashed on the icy peaks of Kargil. It is a conventional belief here that if this gun roared again, things are going to get too bad,\u201d he said.\n\nThat is what happened at 2am on May 8. As the Bofors guns in Mohra prepared to fire ammunition across the mountains into Pakistan, Sheikh felt the ground shaking beneath him. An hour and a half later, a shell fired from the other side hit an Indian paramilitary installation nearby, making a long hissing noise before striking with a thud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHours after Sheikh spoke to Al Jazeera, another shell landed on his home. The rooms and the portico of his house collapsed, according to a video he shared with Al Jazeera later.\n\nHe had refused to leave his home despite his family\u2019s pleas to join them. \u201cI was here to protect our livestock,\u201d Sheikh said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave them alone.\u201d\n\nUnlike the rest of the Kashmir valley, where apple cultivation brings millions of dollars in income for the region, Uri is relatively poor. Villagers mostly work odd jobs for the Indian Army, which maintains large garrisons there, or farm walnuts and pears. Livestock rearing has turned into a popular vocation for many in the town.\n\n\u201cWe have the firsthand experience of what war feels like. It is good that the ceasefire has taken place. But I don\u2019t know if it will hold or not,\u201d Sheikh said, his face downcast. \u201cI pray that it does.\u201d\n\n\u2018How long must this continue?\u2019\n\nBack in Srinagar, residents are slowly returning to the rhythm of their daily lives. Schools and colleges remain closed, and people are avoiding unnecessary travel.\n\nThe scenes of racing drone fleets in the skies and the accompanying blasts are seared into public memory. \u201cOnly in the evening will we come to know whether this ceasefire has held on,\u201d said Muskaan Wani, a student of medicine at Government Medical College, Srinagar, on Sunday.\n\nIt did, overnight, but the tension over whether it will last remains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitical experts attribute the general scepticism about the ceasefire to the unresolved political issues in the region \u2013 a point that was echoed in Trump\u2019s statement on Sunday, in which he referred to a possible \u201csolution concerning Kashmir\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe problem to begin with is the political alienation [of Kashmiris],\u201d said Noor Ahmad Baba, a former professor and head of the political science department at the University of Kashmir.\n\n\u201cPeople in Kashmir feel humiliated for what has happened to them in the last few years, and there haven\u2019t been any significant efforts to win them over. When there\u2019s humiliation, there is suspicion.\u201d\n\nOthers in Indian-administered Kashmir expressed their anger at both countries for ruining their lives.\n\n\u201cI doubt that our feelings as Kashmiris even matter,\u201d said Furqan, a software engineer in Srinagar who gave his first name only. \u201cTwo nuclear powers fought, caused damage and casualties at the borders, gave their respective nations a spectacle to watch, their goals were achieved, and then they stopped the war.\n\n\u201cBut the question is, who suffered the most? It\u2019s us. For the world, we are nothing but collateral damage.\u201d\n\nFurqan said his friends were sceptical about the ceasefire when the two countries resumed shelling on the evening of May 10.\n\n\u201cWe all already were like, \u2018It is not gonna last,'\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we heard the explosions again.\u201d\n\nMuneeb Mehraj, a 26-year-old resident of Srinagar who studies management in the northern Indian state of Punjab, echoed Furqan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor others, the war may be over. A ceasefire has been declared. But once again, it\u2019s Kashmiris who have paid the price \u2013 lives lost, homes destroyed, peace shattered,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long must this cycle continue?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are exhausted,\u201d Mehraj continued. \u201cWe don\u2019t want another temporary pause. We want a lasting, permanent solution.\u201d",

    "title": "US, China hail \u2018substantial progress\u2019 made in tariff talks in Geneva",
    "body": "The two countries have said they will issue a joint statement on the talks on Monday.\n\nBeijing and Washington have both hailed the progress made at the end of a weekend of closed-door discussions in Switzerland aimed at de-escalating trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive worldwide tariff rollout in March and China\u2019s retaliation.\n\nFollowing the talks on Sunday at the Geneva villa of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m happy to report that we\u2019ve made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe talks were productive,\u201d he added.\n\nTrade Representative Jamieson Greer, who also took part in the two days of closed-door talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, said that the differences between the sides were \u201cnot so large as maybe thought\u201d.\n\nHe Lifeng also lauded what he called \u201cimportant progress\u201d in the trade talks with the US.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Geneva, he said the atmosphere of the talks with Bessent and Greer had been candid, in-depth, and substantive, echoing similar language from the US delegation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth countries said they would put out a joint statement on the talks on Monday.\n\nAfter the first day of negotiations, Trump had posted on his social network Truth Social that the discussions had been \u201cvery good\u201d, describing them as \u201ca total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner\u201d.\n\nBeijing had yet to comment Sunday, but on Saturday, Chinese state news agency Xinhua described the talks as \u201can important step in promoting the resolution of the issue\u201d.\n\nThe Chinese delegation was expected to speak to the media on Sunday evening.\n\nThe meetings marked the first time that senior officials from the world\u2019s two largest economies have met face-to-face to tackle the topic of trade since Trump slapped steep new levies on China last month, sparking a robust retaliation from Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe talks reflect that the current state of the trade relations with these extremely high tariffs is ultimately in the interests of neither the United States nor China,\u201d Citigroup global chief economist Nathan Sheets told news agency AFP. He called the tariffs a \u201close-lose proposition\u201d.\n\nThe tariffs imposed by Trump on the Asian manufacturing giant since the start of the year currently total 145 percent, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245 percent.\n\nKeeping expectations low\n\nIn retaliation, China put 125-percent tariffs on US goods.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Trump signalled he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an \u201c80% Tariff on China seems right!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his press secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the US would not lower tariffs unilaterally, as China would also need to make concessions.\n\nGoing into the meeting, both sides played down expectations of a major change in trade relations.\n\nBessent underlined a focus on \u201cde-escalation\u201d and not a \u201cbig trade deal\u201d, while Beijing insisted that the US had to ease tariffs first.\n\nThe fact that the talks are even happening \u201cis good news for business, and for the financial markets\u201d, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nBut Hufbauer cautioned that he was \u201cvery sceptical that there will be any return to something like normal US-China trade relations\u201d. Even a tariff rate of 70 to 80 percent would still potentially halve bilateral trade, he said.\n\nAmong some of the more moderate Trump officials, such as Bessent and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, \u201cthere\u2019s a realisation that China is better equipped to deal with this trade war than the US\u201d, said Hufbauer.\n\nThe Geneva meeting comes after Trump unveiled a trade agreement with the United Kingdom on Thursday, the first deal with any country since he unleashed his blitz of global tariffs, but which maintains a 10-percent baseline levy on most British goods.\n\nFollowing the US-UK trade announcement, analysts have voiced pessimism about the likelihood that negotiations will lead to any significant changes in the US-China trade relationship.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump claimed the talks had made \u201cGREAT PROGRESS!!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business,\u201d he said.",

    "title": "Hamas says it will release US-Israeli captive Edan Alexander",
    "body": "The statement did not indicate when the 21-year-old Alexander would be released.\n\nHamas has said it will release a US-Israeli captive held in Gaza, as the group confirmed it was engaged in direct talks with the United States towards securing a ceasefire in the war-ravaged enclave and getting aid flowing again to a suffering Palestinian population.\n\nThe Palestinian group released a statement on Sunday: \u201cIsraeli soldier Edan Alexander, a dual US national, will be released as part of the steps taken towards a ceasefire, reopen the crossings, and deliver aid and relief to our people in the Gaza Strip\u201d.\n\nIsrael has blocked all aid going into Gaza, including food, medicine and fuel, for 70 days.\n\nThe Hamas statement did not indicate when the 21-year-old Alexander would be released, but it is thought to be in the coming 48 hours.\n\nIsraeli media reported that US envoy Steve Witkoff will be in Israel on Monday as part of the deal.\n\nThe announcement comes shortly before US President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East this week \u2013 which does not include a trip to Israel. Trump and Witkoff have frequently mentioned Alexander by name in the past few months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWitkoff later confirmed Hamas had agreed to release Alexander in the hopes of restarting ceasefire talks.\n\nAlexander, who grew up in the US, was taken from his military base during the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack.\n\nIn its statement on Sunday, Hamas said it was willing to \u201cimmediately begin intensive negotiations\u201d that could lead to an agreement to end the war and would see Gaza under a technocratic and independent administration.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure calm and stability for many years, along with reconstruction and the end of the blockade,\u201d the group said.\n\nQatar and Egypt, the two main mediators, welcomed Hamas\u2019 announcement, saying they considered the group\u2019s move a gesture of goodwill and an encouraging step toward the parties\u2019 return to ceasefire negotiations.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said on Sunday that the US told Israel that Hamas\u2019s freeing of Alexander would lead to negotiations for the release of more captives. The statement added that Israel\u2019s policy hasn\u2019t changed: negotiations will be conducted under fire with a continued commitment to achieving all war objectives.\n\n\u2018A lot of questions\u2019\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear exactly what kind of reaction the Israeli government officials had with these direct talks between Hamas and the United States, but last time they were quite angry and that\u2019s because the Israelis weren\u2019t involved and had no knowledge of those talks and the Americans hit back by saying they didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to negotiate with any of the actors involved because they were American captives held in Gaza\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of questions from a lot of different angles, specifically from the family members of those captives, from the larger part of Israeli society who have been protesting in the thousands for more than 1.5 years, accusing Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for his own personal and political gain. And in fact, Israeli officials have been saying the quiet part out loud in recent weeks, saying that the captives were not the main priority for the Israeli government and that they had other goals and objectives they needed to achieve\u201d, she added.\n\n\u201cThe family members of captives say that the Israeli government is choosing land grabs over the lives of Israelis who are still being held in Gaza\u201d, she continued, referring to the Israeli government\u2019s decision to expand its offensive in Gaza with a view to reoccupying parts of the territory.\n\nTalks ongoing in Doha\n\nEarlier on Sunday, two Hamas officials told the AFP news agency that talks were ongoing in the Qatari capital of Doha with the US and reported \u201cprogress\u201d had been made.\n\nOne Hamas official, speaking about the talks with the US, said there was \u201cprogress made \u2026 notably on the entry of aid to the Gaza Strip\u201d and the potential exchange of captives for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.\n\nA second official also reported progress \u201con the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip\u201d.\n\nIsrael shattered the last ceasefire, which lasted two months, on March 18, launching a major offensive in Gaza and ramping up its bombardment of the territory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has also cut off all aid to Gaza since March 2, saying it would pressure Hamas to release the remaining captives. None have been released since the fleeting truce earlier this year, when several captives were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nA total of 59 captives are still in Gaza, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.\n\nStarvation has taken hold across Gaza due to the Israeli blockade.\n\nEarlier this month, the Israeli government approved plans to expand its offensive in the Gaza Strip, with officials talking of retaining a long-term occupying presence there.\n\nThe Health Ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that at least 2,720 people have been killed since Israel resumed its assault, bringing the overall Palestinian death toll since the war broke out to 52,829.",

    "title": "Fact-checking Trump\u2019s claim of securing $10 trillion in investments for US",
    "body": "The White House reports $5.1 trillion in promised investments, with $4.3 trillion newly pledged. But experts say $2.1 trillion may not fully happen.\n\nSince returning to the White House, US President Donald Trump has touted corporate and foreign US investment announcements as proof he is ushering in \u201cthe golden age of America\u201d.\n\nOn January 21, Trump said that before he\u2019d finished the \u201cfirst full business day\u201d of his second term, the United States had \u201calready secured nearly $3 trillion of new investments\u201d.\n\nOn April 2, he said, \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re going to have about $6 trillion of investments\u201d. Six days later, Trump told National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner attendees that the investment total was \u201cnow revised up to about $7 (trillion)\u201d.\n\nDuring an April 30 NewsNation town hall, Trump speculated that \u201cit could be more than $8 trillion\u201d.\n\nOn May 4, Trump told Kristen Welker, the host of the NBC News programme Meet the Press, \u201cI think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country.\u201d\n\nOn May 6, Trump told reporters, \u201cI think the real number could be $9 or $10 trillion.\u201d\n\nFinally, on May 8, Trump said, \u201cWe have now close to $10 trillion \u2014 think of that, $10 trillion\u201d in investments. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about essentially two months.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s far beyond the figures the White House has released publicly.\n\nWe tallied the White House\u2019s public lists of investments; they amount to $2.1 trillion in corporate investments, or at most $5.1 trillion when including promised investments from other countries. Experts cautioned that the promised corporate investments are not guaranteed to materialise in full, or during Trump\u2019s presidency, and some of them would have occurred regardless of who was president.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the first to overstate new investments on his watch. Outgoing US President Joe Biden said in 2024 that his bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act had attracted $640bn in private investments; economists told PolitiFact that Biden\u2019s numbers were based on what companies had announced, which is not the same as dollars already spent.\n\nRoman V Yampolskiy, a University of Louisville professor and a specialist in artificial intelligence, which dominates the promised investments Trump cited, said, \u201cHistorically, large-scale investment announcements often overpromise and underdeliver. There is a performative element to them, especially in politically charged contexts. They function as political theatre as much as economic commitment.\u201d\n\nWhite House lists do not match Trump\u2019s words\n\nSince Trump\u2019s inauguration, the White House has publicised investment announcements from three countries and roughly 60 companies on its website, including in a \u201cnon-comprehensive running list\u201d. Many of the highest-dollar corporate announcements were in March and April.\n\nCorporate announcements in the White House\u2019s lists total approximately $2.1 trillion worth of US investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House separately has cited commitments from the United Arab Emirates to invest $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years; from Japan to \u201cboost\u201d its investment in the US to $1 trillion; and from Saudi Arabia to invest $600bn in the US during Trump\u2019s presidency. Combined with the corporate announcements, these bring the total to about $5.1 trillion, $4.9 trillion short of Trump\u2019s figure.\n\nBut the $5.1 trillion total has caveats. For example, the White House said \u201cJapan announced a $1 trillion investment in the US\u201d, but the article it linked said in 2023, Japan\u2019s US investment was $783.3bn and Japan would \u201cboost\u201d that to $1 trillion. That\u2019s an increase of $216.7bn rather than a new $1 trillion investment. That would put the total value of newly pledged US investment at about $4.3 trillion.\n\nTrump\u2019s second-term White House tally of US investments\n\nThe White House figures can\u2019t easily be used for apples-to-apples comparisons. Some of the investments are planned over Trump\u2019s four-year term, others over five years or a decade. In one case \u2013 ADQ and Energy Capital Partners\u2019 planned $25bn investment \u2014 it isn\u2019t limited to US-based projects.\n\nThe White House declined to detail additional investments. A spokesperson pointed to federal Bureau of Economic Analysis data that shows a 22 percent increase in business investment in the first quarter of 2025, calling it a historic increase.\n\nHowever, experts cautioned this increase was shaped by businesses stocking up on inventory before Trump\u2019s tariffs take effect and said the increase is unlikely to be sustained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of the announcements are aspirational, experts say\n\nExperts told PolitiFact that each of the five biggest investments on Trump\u2019s list warrants some caution, because they might not reach Trump\u2019s cited dollar amounts or were not solely prompted by Trump\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cMany of these announcements, particularly those in the AI and semiconductor sectors, appear to be, at least in part, aspirational in nature,\u201d Yampolskiy said. \u201cThey serve a signalling function: to attract investor attention, shape policy discourse, and secure favourable regulatory or funding environments.\u201d\n\nThe five largest company investments collectively account for 82 percent of the dollar value on the White House\u2019s corporate list.\n\nFive companies accounting for the majority of new investment promises are:\n\nStargate\n\nThe Stargate Project is an artificial intelligence collaboration among OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, announced during a January 21 White House event. The White House values the investment at $500bn.\n\nThe company\u2019s official announcement says $100bn will be invested \u201cimmediately\u201d and that it \u201cintends to invest\u201d a total of $500bn over the next four years, a goal repeated by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son at the White House event.\n\n\u201cWhether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen,\u201d wrote John Higgins, chief economist at Capital Economics, an international consulting firm.\n\nEnrique Dans, who studies technology and policy at Madrid\u2019s IE Business School, said the $500bn figure is \u201castronomical \u2013 roughly 2 percent of US gross domestic product \u2013 and lacks clear documentation\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the White House event, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without you, Mr President.\u201d But Altman had been discussing plans for a $100bn investment 10 months before Trump won his second term, The Washington Post reported, including an Abilene, Texas, data centre that began construction in summer 2024.\n\n\u201cAI investments have been on a global trajectory driven by technological maturity and competitive pressure, especially from China,\u201d Dans said. \u201cAny US president would have seen a surge.\u201d\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia Corp, another AI company, said it plans to invest up to $500bn in US infrastructure over the next four years. Previously, Nvidia manufactured most of its chips in Taiwan.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely Nvidia would have moved any production to the US if it was not for pressure from the Trump administration,\u201d Gil Luria, an analyst with the financial services firm D.A. Davidson, told Reuters. However, Luria added, \u201cThe half a trillion number is likely hyperbole.\u201d\n\nDans said that although tax cuts from Trump\u2019s first term have benefited the company\u2019s focus on US-based efforts, \u201cthe core growth likely would have occurred anyway\u201d, regardless of the president.\n\nApple\n\nOn February 24, days after Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook, met with Trump, the consumer electronics giant announced it plans to spend \u201cmore than $500bn in the US over the next four years.\u201d\n\nAnalysts have expressed scepticism that this represents new investment. Dans called the investment \u201csimply more of what [Apple] already does,\u201d from \u201cday-to-day activities with thousands of suppliers in all 50 states to the operation of its domestic data centres, as well as its investments in Apple TV+ and other projects already manufactured in the country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a note to investors, David Vogt, an analyst with the Swiss-based bank UBS, wrote, \u201cCall us a sceptic. \u2026 We believe [the figure] lacks substance.\u201d\n\nIBM\n\nIBM announced April 28 plans to invest $150bn in the US, including more than $30bn in research and development on US-based manufacturing of mainframe and quantum computers.\n\nThis is \u201cnot clearly Trump-related,\u201d Dans said. \u201cIBM\u2019s strategy pivots have been under way since the 2010s.\u201d\n\nLuria said, \u201cWhile we believe IBM will continue to invest in the emerging area of quantum technology, the bombastic figure is more likely a gesture towards the US administration,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which makes semiconductors for computing and electronics, has pledged to spend $100bn in the US. Analysts said this number is the most well-supported among the investments that Trump cites. Although bringing semiconductor production back to the US began during Trump\u2019s first term, it was \u201cgreatly accelerated by\u201d Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, which prompted years of investment before Trump\u2019s second term, Dans said.\n\nOver the past five years, the company has spent at least $65bn on fabrication facilities near Phoenix, Arizona, funded in part by $6.6bn from the CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nOverall, Dans said, \u201cTrump might deserve some partial credit for setting a more aggressive tone on economic nationalism and supply chain reshoring, and for lowering the corporate tax reform, which did affect repatriation and some investment decisions. But most of these trends \u2014 the AI boom, the semiconductor reshoring, the cloud computing infrastructure \u2014 are long-term structural shifts that predate Trump and will continue regardless of who is in office.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said, \u201cWe have now close to $10 trillion, think of that, $10 trillion\u201d in investments. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about essentially two months.\u201d\n\nThe White House has pointed to investment announcements totalling $5.1 trillion, including $2.1 trillion from companies and the rest from countries.\n\nThat\u2019s at least $4.9 trillion short of Trump\u2019s figure, and these announcements represent future spending, some of which is planned over four years, five years or a decade.\n\nExperts said many of the dollar amounts are aspirational and that the investments announced might never be fully reached. They also said some of this investment would have occurred regardless of who was president.\n\nWe rate the statement false.",

In 2023, floods killed 400 people in several communities located on the shores of Lake Kivu, in South Kivu province, while last month, 33 people were killed in flooding in the capital, Kinshasa.\n\nDR Congo has also been subject to decades of fighting between government troops and rebels in the eastern part of the country, which escalated in late January when the Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu state, in a rapid and surprise offensive.\n\nNearly 3,000 people were killed and 2,880 injured in the Goma offensive, worsening what is already considered one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises, with more than seven million people remaining displaced.",

Regardless of Real\u2019s result, a Barcelona victory in their city derby against Espanyol on Thursday would guarantee the championship for the Catalans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMbappe opened the scoring from the penalty spot after he was fouled inside the box by keeper Wojciech Szczesny in the fifth minute, and he extended their lead with a quick counter nine minutes later from an assist by Vinicius Jr.\n\nHowever, Barcelona responded swiftly with Eric Garcia, Lamine Yamal and Raphinha all finding the net within 15 minutes to overturn the deficit.\n\nGarcia headed home from a corner in the 19th minute while Yamal scored the equaliser in the 32nd with another brilliant display of technique as he curled a superb shot from the right corner of the box just outside Courtois\u2019s reach and inside the far post.\n\nTwo minutes later, a mistake by Mbappe in the midfield gifted Barca the ball, and Raphinha launched a quick counter, giving his side the lead with a tidy finish past a helpless Courtois.\n\nReal thought they had earned a second penalty in the 43rd minute, but it was overturned due to an offside in the build-up. And one minute later, a costly error by captain Lucas Vazquez gifted Raphinha the goal that extended Barca\u2019s lead.\n\nBarcelona came back strongly in the second half and had several chances denied by a string of stunning saves by Courtois.\n\nThey were shocked, however, when Mbappe reduced the deficit in the 70th minute after a quick counterattack by Vinicius, who ran up the right side and put it on a plate for the France forward to complete his hat-trick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet last year\u2019s champions could not recover, leaving them on the brink of a season without silverware.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously very important to win today. It\u2019s great to have this game after the Champions League. I think it\u2019s already forgotten,\u201d Yamal told Movistar Plus after Barca were knocked out of the European club competition in the semifinals in a heartbreaking midweek loss to Inter Milan.\n\n\u201cSuffering is what makes you strong and what teaches you to correct the mistakes you make. They didn\u2019t create any clear-cut chances other than the goals.\n\n\u201cIt was very important to win today to get closer to the league title. We are delighted.\u201d\n\nReal manager Carlo Ancelotti, meanwhile, is set to come under increased pressure with rumours the former Real midfielder Xabi Alonso will replace him at the end of the season.\n\nThe Italian-born coach was in a pragmatic mood, however, about the result and his side\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cIt was an evenly played match, competitive and fought until the last second,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe could have scored the equaliser, but it is what it is. It was a great game between two great teams, so I have nothing to reproach my team for in terms of attitude and commitment. It didn\u2019t go well, but we competed.\u201d\n\nAlonso told reporters on Friday that he would be leaving his role as Bayer Leverkusen coach at the end of the season while Ancelotti complimented the former Spanish international, saying the \u201cthe doors are open\u201d for him to now move to a big club.",

    "body": "A ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding, after both sides accused each other of initial violations, as an uneasy calm has taken hold following days of the worst eruption of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in decades.\n\nThe Indian military sent a \u201chotline message\u201d to Pakistan on Sunday about violations of an agreed-upon ceasefire, informing it of New Delhi\u2019s intent to respond if this was repeated, a top Indian army officer said.\n\nIndia\u2019s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) was speaking on Sunday as a fragile 24-hour-old ceasefire appeared to be holding after both sides blamed the other for initial violations on Saturday night.\n\nThe truce announced on Saturday halted several days of missiles and drones being fired at each country across their shared border, killing almost 70 people.\n\nDiplomacy and pressure from the United States helped secure the ceasefire deal when it seemed that the conflict was spiralling towards a full-scale war. Within hours of its coming into force, there were explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir, the centre of much of last week\u2019s fighting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities near the border under a blackout, similar to those heard during the previous two evenings, according to local authorities, residents and witnesses.\n\n\u201cSometimes, these understandings take time to fructify, manifest on the ground,\u201d Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai, the Indian DGMO, told a media briefing, referring to the truce. \u201cThe [Indian] armed forces were on a very, very high alert [yesterday] and continue to be in that state.\u201d\n\nThe Indian army chief had given a mandate to its commanders to deal with \u201cviolations of any kind\u201d from across the borders in the best way they deem fit, Ghai added.\n\nHe said his Pakistani counterpart called him on Saturday afternoon and proposed the two countries \u201ccease hostilities\u201d and urgently requested a ceasefire.\n\nThere was no immediate response to the Indian comments from Pakistan. Early on Sunday, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry had said that it was committed to the truce agreement and blamed India for the violations.\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire on Saturday, saying it was reached after talks mediated by Washington.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India and Pakistan had also agreed to start talks on \u201ca broad set of issues at a neutral site\u201d.\n\nWhile Islamabad has thanked Washington for facilitating the ceasefire and welcomed Trump\u2019s offer to mediate on the Kashmir dispute with India, New Delhi has not commented on US involvement in the truce or talks at a neutral site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia maintains that disputes with Pakistan have to be resolved directly by the two countries and rejects any third-party involvement.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump praised the leaders of both countries for agreeing to halt the aggression and said he would \u201csubstantially\u201d increase trade with them.\n\nHindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan each rule a part of disputed Kashmir but claim it in full, and have twice gone to war over the Himalayan region.\n\nIndia blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of the territory, but Pakistan says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.\n\n\u2018A tough night in border areas\u2019\n\nAmong those most affected by the fighting were residents on either side of the border, many of whom fled their homes when the fighting began on Wednesday, two weeks after a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam that India said was backed by Islamabad.\n\nPakistan denied the accusation.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Lahore, Pakistan, said it was \u201ca tough night for a lot of people in the border areas\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople said there was shelling in the early hours of the morning and throughout the evening, even after the announcement of ceasefire,\u201d Bin Javaid said.\n\nAlthough people are cautious, they\u2019re \u201cnot coming back yet to their homes because they believe that this is not over yet\u201d, he said, adding that there has been damage in several villages across the Line of Control.\n\nOverall, however, \u201cthere\u2019s jubilation and celebration,\u201d Bin Javaid added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Indian border city of Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs, people returned to the streets on Sunday morning after a siren sounded to signal the resumption of normal activities following the tension of recent days.\n\n\u201cEver since the terrorists attacked people in Pahalgam, we have been shutting our shops very early and there was an uncertainty. I am happy that at least there will be no bloodshed on both sides,\u201d said Satvir Singh Alhuwalia, 48, a shopkeeper in the city.\n\nAnother local resident noted the \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d throughout the Kashmir Valley since the ceasefire announcement.\n\n\u201cYou can feel it in the air \u2026 but there seems to be a bit of fear, as well. Will it hold, given the past history of both these nations?\u201d asked Muteeb Banday.\n\n\u201c[Kashmiris] want \u2026 long-lasting peace, so that we can go and live our lives, think about our future, make our lives better.\u201d\n\nIn some border areas, however, people were asked not to return home just yet. In the Indian-administered Kashmir city of Baramulla, authorities warned residents to stay away due to the threat posed by unexploded munitions.\n\n\u201cPeople here are hosting us well, but just as a bird feels at peace in its own nest, we also feel comfortable only in our own homes, even if they have been damaged,\u201d said Azam Chaudhry, 55, who fled his home in the Pakistani town of Khuiratta and has now been told to wait until Monday before returning.\n\nIn Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s Uri, a key power plant that was damaged in a Pakistani drone attack is still under repair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe project has suffered minor damage \u2026 We have stopped generation as the transmission line has been damaged,\u201d said an official from state-run NHPC, India\u2019s biggest hydropower company, who did not want to be identified.",

    "body": "Multiple attacks by Sudan\u2019s armed forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have struck various locations across the country now in its third year of a civil war.\n\nAt least nine civilians, including four children, were killed and seven injured in attacks on Sunday by the RSF in el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state in western Sudan, according to the Sudanese army.\n\nDuring a sweep of the city, the SAF killed six RSF members and destroyed three combat vehicles, according to the statement. There was no immediate comment from the RSF on the army report.\n\nEl-Fasher is the last major city held by SAF in Darfur. For over a year, the RSF has sought to wrest control it, located more than 800km (500 miles) southwest of the capital, Khartoum, from the SAF, launching regular attacks on the city and two major famine-hit camps for displaced people on its outskirts.\n\nIn the meantime, Sudan\u2019s civil defence forces announced on Sunday that they have full control over fires that erupted at the main fuel depot and other strategic sites in Port Sudan, the seat of the army-backed government, which has come under daily drone attacks blamed on the RSF over the past week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fires caused by a drone strike on the fuel depot on Monday had spread across \u201cwarehouses filled with fuel\u201d, the Sudanese army-aligned authorities said, warning of a \u201cpotential disaster in the area\u201d.\n\nThe Red Sea port city had been seen as a safe haven from the devastating two-year conflict between the SAF and RSF before the drone strikes began on May 4.\n\nThe attacks have damaged several key facilities, including the country\u2019s sole international civilian airport, its largest working fuel depot and the city\u2019s main power station.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sudanese authorities accused the RSF of being behind the drone strikes. The RSF has not commented on the allegations.\n\nPort Sudan is the main entry point for humanitarian aid into Sudan. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the attacks \u201cthreaten to increase humanitarian needs and further complicate aid operations in the country\u201d, his spokesman said.\n\nSudan\u2019s army launched air strikes on the RSF in el-Khuwei in West Kordofan state and the state of West Darfur late on Saturday.

    "title": "Is due process different for undocumented immigrants as Trump claims?",
    "body": "The US Constitution ensures all immigrants have due process, but rights depend on legal status and time spent in the US.\n\nIn a recent TV interview, United States President Donald Trump said he did not know whether he needed to uphold the US Constitution.\n\nTrump was answering a question on NBC News last week about whether undocumented immigrants in the US are entitled to due process.\n\n\u201cThey talk about due process, but do you get due process when you\u2019re here illegally,\u201d Trump asked the interviewer, Kristen Welker, NBC\u2019s Meet the Press moderator.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution says every person, citizens and noncitizens, deserves due process,\u201d Welker responded.\n\nShe then asked Trump whether he agreed with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said noncitizens are entitled to due process.\n\nTrump: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a lawyer. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWelker: \u201cWell, the Fifth Amendment says as much.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cI don\u2019t know. It might say that, but if you\u2019re talking about that, then we\u2019d have to have a million or two million or three million trials.\u201d\n\nWelker: \u201cBut even given those numbers that you\u2019re talking about, don\u2019t you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. They have a different interpretation.\u201d\n\nThat was not the first time Trump had brushed aside immigrants\u2019 due process rights.\n\nIn an ABC News interview marking Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, correspondent Terry Moran asked Trump, \u201cBut in our country, even bad guys get due process, right?\u201d\n\nTrump answered, \u201cIf people come into our country illegally, there\u2019s a different standard.\u201d\n\nDuring a May 1 speech at the University of Alabama\u2019s commencement ceremony, Trump said, \u201cJudges are interfering supposedly based on due process, but how can you give due process to people who came into our country illegally? They want to give them due process. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nDays later, while announcing that the 2027 NFL (National Football League) draft will be in Washington, DC, Trump said, \u201cThe courts have, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, they said, maybe you have to have trials. Trials. We\u2019re gonna have five million trials? Doesn\u2019t work \u2026 Past presidents took out hundreds of thousands of people when needed \u2026 They didn\u2019t go through any of this.\u201d\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s dismissal of and questions about due process for immigrants, the US Constitution, legal experts and decades of court decisions agree: immigrants, regardless of how they entered the US, legally or illegally, have due process rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat those rights look like varies depending on how long a person has been in the US and what their legal status is.\n\nWhat are due process rights?\n\nDue process generally refers to the government\u2019s requirement to follow fair procedures and laws. The Constitution\u2019s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect \u201cany person\u201d against being deprived by the US government of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due process of law\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople have a right to be heard, and there are certain steps that need to be taken before someone can, say, be jailed,\u201d Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a lawyer and policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said.\n\nSeveral court rulings have determined that due process rights are extended to all people in the US, not just US citizens or immigrants in the country legally. The US Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act dictate the process the government must use to afford immigrants due process rights.\n\nIn immigration, due process generally refers to \u201cappropriate notice [of government action], the opportunity to have a hearing or some sort of screening interview to figure out, are you actually a person who falls within the law that says that you can be deported\u201d, Katherine Yon Ebright, a lawyer at the Brennan Centre for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security programme, said.\n\nFor example, if the government seeks to deport people who are undocumented, the government generally must give them a charging document known as a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d. Eventually, immigrants go before an immigration judge to present evidence and make a case that they qualify for some form of relief against deportation, such as asylum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout due process, legal experts say, US citizens could also be deported.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of due process is to determine whether you\u2019re the kind of person who can be subject to deportation,\u201d Ilya Somin, a George Mason University constitutional law professor, said. \u201cIf there is no due process, then the government can simply deport people or punish them at will \u2026 Because how can you show that you\u2019re actually a US citizen if you\u2019re not getting any due process?\u201d\n\nHow do due process rights differ for noncitizens compared with US citizens?\n\nEven though all people in the US have due process rights, for noncitizens, the specifics of the process and the extent of protections vary. The term noncitizen applies to people with legal documents as well as those without any documents, including people here on visas, with lawful permanent status or without a legal immigration status.\n\nThere is a \u201csliding scale of different protections that people can have depending on what their [immigration] status is\u201d, Yon Ebright said.\n\nNoncitizens are not entitled to government-appointed lawyers during immigration proceedings, for example. And some immigrants who recently entered the US without a legal document do not have to appear before a judge before being deported; these cases are subject to what is called the expedited removal process.\n\nUnder expedited removal, certain people can be quickly deported without a court case. However, people who express fear of persecution if they return to their home countries are referred to immigration officers, who determine whether the immigrant is eligible for asylum or other deportation protections. Immigrants who pass the \u201ccredible fear\u201d screening are referred to an immigration court where they can present their case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past, people were placed in expedited removal if they were within 100 miles (about 161km) of the border and within two weeks of their entry. In January, Trump expanded expedited removal for anyone who cannot prove they have been in the US for more than two years.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime power that Trump invoked in March, allows the government to deport \u201calien enemies\u201d. He has used that law to deport people his administration says are members of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua, without immigration court hearings. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of people under the law.\n\nHowever, the US Supreme Court ruled against the administration on April 7, saying it must give immigrants notice that they will be deported under the Alien Enemies Act, and give them \u201creasonable time\u201d to challenge the deportation in court.\n\nAlthough expedited removal and the Alien Enemies Act limit people\u2019s due process protections, they do not eliminate them. \u201cThere are no exceptions to due process,\u201d Bush-Joseph said.\n\nAdditionally, noncitizens who are charged with crimes receive the same due process protections as US citizens in criminal court, Somin said.\n\n\u201cAll of the protections of the Bill of Rights apply [in criminal court],\u201d Somin said. \u201cThere has to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt. He or she is entitled to a jury trial, rights against self-incrimination, right to counsel and so on.\u201d\n\nWhy are immigrants\u2019 due process rights making headlines now?\n\nThe Trump administration faces several court cases dealing with deportations and immigrants\u2019 due process rights. They include challenges over Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act and the government\u2019s mistaken deportation of a Salvadoran man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdministration officials have criticised judges and rejected immigrants\u2019 due process protections.\n\n\u201cDue process guarantees the rights of a criminal defendant facing prosecution, not an illegal alien facing deportation,\u201d White House adviser Stephen Miller posted on X on May 5.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s comments about due process are centred on his promise to carry out the largest deportation operation in US history. The administration\u2019s current deportation pace is below its goal of one million people each year, the Migration Policy Institute said in an April 24 analysis.\n\nNayna Gupta, policy director of the immigrant rights advocacy group American Immigration Council, said the Trump administration is attempting to \u201cget around those obstacles and those requirements\u201d of due process \u201cjust to meet some target [deportation] number\u201d.\n\nTo reach Trump\u2019s goal of one million deportations annually, the administration would need to deport people who have lived in the US for years and have no criminal convictions (whom past administrations have not prioritised for deportation).\n\nPast presidents were also required to uphold noncitizens\u2019 due process rights, but deportation processes moved more quickly under administrations that focused on people who had recently crossed the border illegally, Bush-Joseph said. That option is more limited for the Trump administration because undocumented immigration has reached historic lows under Trump.\n\nTrump is correct that deporting millions of people living in the US without legal documents would require millions of court cases, Tara Watson, director of the Centre for Economic Security and Opportunity at the Brookings Institution, said. That has long been the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMillions of immigration court cases are backlogged. And the Trump administration has fired several immigration judges who would hear these cases.\n\nThe administration\u2019s goal for mass deportation does not change due process rules and standards.\n\n\u201cIt is true that due process slows down the machinery of deportation, but due process is also what separates democracies from dictatorships,\u201d Watson said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said, \u201cIf people come into our country without documents, there\u2019s a different standard [for due process].\u201d\n\nAll people in the US, regardless of their immigration status, have due process rights, based on the US Constitution and decades of court decisions. That applies whether they entered the US legally or without any documents.\n\nFor noncitizens, people\u2019s due process protections vary based on their legal status or how long they have been in the US. Legal experts say, despite due process variations, there are no exceptions to due process requirements for immigrants.\n\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement False.",

bombing near residential towers located west of Khan Younis in southern Gaza.\n\nAnother two people were killed in artillery shelling of a home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City in the north

fuel enter the territory for 70 days due to Israel\u2019s blockade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2.3 million residents of Gaza are surviving on fast-dwindling supplies and charity kitchens, which have been gradually forced to shut down as they run out of food and hunger spreads.\n\nThe United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) warned on Sunday that the longer the blockade continues, the more irreversible harm is being done to Palestinians.\n\n\u201cUNRWA has thousands of trucks ready to enter and our teams in Gaza are ready to scale up the delivery,\u201d the organisation said.\n\nHamas said in a statement on Sunday that Israel is committing a \u201ccomplex crime\u201d.\n\nIsrael\u2019s security cabinet this month approved a plan to fully occupy the Gaza Strip and force another mass displacement of Palestinians.\n\nIsrael has also proposed taking over any future humanitarian aid distribution, which would, it said, involve creating designated military zones.\n\nThe Humanitarian Country Team, a forum that includes UN agencies, warned that the plan is dangerous and would \u201ccontravene fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2013 as part of a military strategy\u201d.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Sunday that the country would accept a new US mechanism that would start delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nA group of American security contractors, former military officers and humanitarian aid officials is proposing to take over the distribution of food and other supplies in Gaza based on plans similar to those designed by Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plan has been criticised for bypassing the UN and aid groups with expertise in aid delivery and creating only four distribution points that would force a large number of Palestinians to travel to southern Gaza.\n\nAccording to the latest figures by Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health on Sunday, at least 52,829 Palestinians have been confirmed killed and 119,554 wounded by Israeli military attacks since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, which killed an estimated 1,139 people and resulted in more than 200 people taken captive into Gaza.\n\nPope Leo XIV called for an immediate ceasefire, entry of humanitarian aid and release of all those held in Gaza during his first Sunday blessing since his election as pontiff.\n\nIsrael to pay soldiers more before Gaza expansion\n\nThe Israeli military planned to intensify its ground occupation of Gaza on Sunday, pulling the Paratroopers Brigade back from its incursions into Syria to be redeployed to Gaza.\n\nThe paratroopers have been operating in the occupied Golan Heights and inside Syria since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in December.\n\nIsrael withdrew the Nahal Brigade from the occupied West Bank \u2013 which has also been under assault for months \u2013 in its intended and self-proclaimed push to \u201cconquer\u201d Gaza.\n\nBut thousands of Israeli reservists and other members of the Israeli military and security agencies, along with thousands of Israelis demonstrating in the streets, have been calling for an end to the war to bring back all captives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo address the growing dissatisfaction among soldiers, the Israeli government on Sunday approved a \u201ccomprehensive benefit plan\u201d for reservists worth about 3 billion shekels ($838m) that is slated to include a series of economic and social benefits.\n\nThe army welcomed the plan approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying in a statement that it is a reflection of soldiers\u2019 \u201cexceptional contribution\u201d to Israeli society.\n\nThis comes as United States President Donald Trump, who has reportedly had some differences with Netanyahu in recent weeks over the Gaza war and how to engage with Iran, will launch a tour of the Middle East this week.",

    "body": "Leo XIV, the first American pope, voted in past Republican primaries but is not formally registered with any party.\n\nHours after Robert Prevost became the first United States-born pontiff on May 8, social media discussions in the US speculated whether Pope Leo XIV, as he is known after the election, was a \u201cregistered Republican\u201d.\n\n\u201cSCOOP: Our Turning Point Action team pulled the voting history for Pope Leo XIV,\u201d conservative influencer Charlie Kirk wrote on social media platform X on May 8. \u201cHe\u2019s a registered Republican who has voted in Republican primaries when not living abroad. Our data shows he\u2019s a strong Republican, and he\u2019s pro-life.\u201d\n\nMany other X posts called Prevost a \u201cregistered Republican\u201d.\n\nPrevost, 69, is a registered voter in Will County, Illinois, and has cast ballots there over the past 13 years. In Illinois, voters do not register by party affiliation. But they declare a party when voting in a primary, according to an April video by the Illinois State Board of Elections.\n\n\u201cHowever, you are not tied down or formally registered to this party and are free to vote for another party at a subsequent election,\u201d the video says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Illinois voter registration application does not ask people to provide a party affiliation.\n\nThe Will County clerk\u2019s office sent PolitiFact Prevost\u2019s voter information, which lists his party affiliation as \u201cundeclared\u201d. It shows that he voted in the 2012, 2014 and 2016 Republican primaries. He voted absentee in the 2024 general election, with an undeclared party affiliation.\n\nThe viral screenshots Kirk and others shared on X are from L2, a paywalled database that aggregates consumer and voter data. L2\u2019s profile of Prevost lists \u201cRepublican\u201d in its \u201cparty\u201d field.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 New Pope is a registered REPUBLICAN! pic.twitter.com/bj8MH8H2Qs \u2014 Jared Small \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (@jaredsmall) May 8, 2025\n\nIt is unclear how L2 determines a party affiliation for people who live in states such as Illinois, where this information is not included in voter registration. L2 did not respond to PolitiFact\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBorn in 1955, Prevost grew up in Dolton, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. He was ordained as a priest in 1982, then moved to Peru, where he lived from 1988 through 1998. In 1999, he returned to Chicago to serve as the prior provincial of the Augustinian province of \u201cMother of Good Counsel\u201d, which covers the Midwest and Canada.\n\nPrevost\u2019s voter file lists his address to a house owned by his brother, John Prevost. We were unable to determine Robert Prevost\u2019s address or where he was registered to vote before 2012. In 2014, he returned to Peru and served as the bishop of Chiclayo from 2015 to 2023. He then moved to Rome, where he has lived since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS citizens who live overseas and meet certain criteria can vote absentee while abroad.\n\nWe contacted the clerk\u2019s office in Cook County, Illinois, where Chicago is located, to ask whether Prevost has a voter file in the county. The clerk\u2019s office directed us to submit a Freedom of Information Act request for that information; we did so, but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nElizabeth Shakman Hurd, chair of religious studies and political science professor at Northwestern University in the Chicago suburbs, said Prevost\u2019s voting history does not tell the public \u201cmuch about his views or positions other than that in that particular primary he was inclined toward one or more of the Republican candidates\u201d.\n\nOur ruling\n\nX posts said Prevost is a \u201cregistered Republican\u201d.\n\nPrevost is registered to vote in Illinois, where voters do not register with a party affiliation. However, they declare a party affiliation when voting in a primary. County records show Prevost voted in three Republican primaries from 2012 through 2016, the most recent records we obtained.\n\nStill, the Illinois State Board of Elections says when voters participate in primaries, they are not formally registered to a party.\n\nNo one is registered by party affiliation in Illinois, and evidence is scant about Prevost\u2019s voting history over his lifetime.\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.\n\nPolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this fact-check.",

The US currently has a 145 percent tariff on goods from China.\n\n\u201cChina makes 80 percent of all toys sold in this country and 90 percent of all Christmas goods sold in this country,\u201d former New York Times columnist Charles Blow said during a May 5 appearance on CNN\u2019s News Night with Abby Phillip. \u201cWe have a lot of leverage with China. The Christmas and the doll industry is not one of them.\u201d\n\nBlow told PolitiFact his source was an April 29 report in The New York Times. It said, \u201cFactories in China produce nearly 80 percent of all toys and 90 percent of Christmas goods sold in America.\u201d\n\nData shows those figures are rounded up, but not far off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlow\u2019s statement is \u201cdirectionally accurate but slightly overstated on toys\u201d, said Gilberto Garcia-Vazquez, chief economist at Datawheel, which operates an online economic data platform called the Observatory of Economic Complexity.\n\nHe said out of $41bn worth of imports in toys, games and sports equipment in 2024 by the US, $30bn, or about 73 percent, was manufactured in China.\n\n\u201cIf you include domestic production \u2013 small but non-negligible \u2013 China likely supplies closer to 72 percent of toys actually sold in the US, not 80 percent,\u201d Garcia-Vazquez said. The Observatory of Economic Complexity uses data sources from \u201cstatistical offices, open data portals or custom union websites\u201d.\n\nClaire Huber, spokesperson for the US International Trade Commission (USITC), provided PolitiFact with an analysis of 2024 data that showed 78.3 percent of toy imports and 85 percent of Christmas-related imports, such as lights, trees and decorations, are manufactured in China. The toy category includes dolls, wheeled toys and scale models.\n\nThe data was compiled using the USITC\u2019s DataWeb, which cites statistics published by the US Department of Commerce\u2019s Census Bureau, accessed on May 9.\n\nGarcia-Vazquez also analysed 2024 data for Christmas goods and said 90 percent of US imports in that category came from China.\n\nHe said Christmas lights are an exception because \u201cCambodia has recently overtaken China as the top source\u201d.\n\nThe New York Times published an April 27 report that showed 76 percent of \u201ctoys and puzzles\u201d and 87 percent of \u201cChristmas decorations\u201d come from China. Bloomberg, citing the trade organisation Toy Association, said \u201croughly 80 percent of toys sold in the US are made in China\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData shows 73 to 78 percent of toy imports and 85 to 90 percent of Christmas-related imports in 2024 came from China, supporting Blow\u2019s point that the vast majority of these goods come from China.

    "title": "India tried to project strength but ended up showing weakness",
    "body": "On May 10, United States President Donald Trump announced a \u201cfull and immediate\u201d ceasefire between India and Pakistan brokered by his administration. US media reported that, alarmed by intelligence signalling further escalation, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles drove urgent mediation. Vance warned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of catastrophic risks and encouraged direct talks between India and Pakistan.\n\nThe announcement of the ceasefire was received across the world with a sigh of relief. The spectre of a nuclear exchange, which according to one 2019 study could kill up to 125 million people in less than a week, had fuelled regional anxiety and spurred the US diplomatic frenzy.\n\nIn India, however, Trump\u2019s announcement was seen differently in some quarters. Former Indian army chief Ved Prakash Malik posted on X: \u201cCeasefire 10 May 25: We have left India\u2019s future history to ask what politico-strategic advantages, if any, were gained after its kinetic and non-kinetic actions.\u201d MP Asaduddin Owaisi wrote on the same platform: \u201cI wish our PM @narendramodi had announced the ceasefire rather than the President of a foreign country. We have always been opposed to third party intervention since Simla (1972). Why have we now accepted it? I hope the Kashmir issue will not be internationalised, as it is our internal matter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latter comment likely refers to Trump\u2019s statement that he is willing to work with India and Pakistan \u201cto see if, after a \u2018thousand years,\u2019 a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir\u201d.\n\nThe ceasefire announcement by the US president appears to have been perceived by some in India as a sign of the Modi government\u2019s retreat under US pressure while his offer to mediate on Kashmir is being seen as an indication that India\u2019s longstanding rejection of third-party intervention is being undermined.\n\nIn South Asian geopolitics, perception often outpaces reality \u2013 until reality bites. India has long projected regional dominance, bolstered by economic growth and nuclear might. Yet its actions in the aftermath of the April 22 massacre carried out by the Resistance Front (TRF) in Kashmir exposed its vulnerabilities. Intended to assert strength, India\u2019s response faltered, boosting Pakistan\u2019s regional standing and leaving Modi\u2019s government diplomatically weakened.\n\nOn May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle terrorist bases linked to groups like the TRF, which, it claims, is supported by Pakistan. Backed by French-made Rafale jets, the operation sought to project Modi\u2019s strongman image amid domestic outrage. Yet its success was contested. Pakistan reported civilian casualties, including children, while India insisted only terrorist sites were hit.\n\nPakistan\u2019s air force scrambled its own jets to deflect the attack and claimed it downed five Indian jets, including three Rafales. Two US officials confirmed to the Reuters news agency that a Chinese-made J-10 jet shot down at least two Indian planes, aided by Chinese intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) support. India has not acknowledged any losses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndian media initially claimed devastating strikes on Pakistani cities, including Karachi\u2019s seaport, but these reports, which were clearly part of propaganda efforts, were proven false.\n\nOn May 9, India launched missile attacks on Pakistani bases, including one near Islamabad, Pakistan claimed. The Pakistani army retaliated with short-range missile and drone strikes targeting Indian airbases at Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj. Indian air force officer Vyomika Singh reported Pakistani drones and munitions hit civilian and military targets.\n\nIndia\u2019s image as a regional hegemon frayed. The Indian government clearly overestimated its Rafale jets and underestimated Pakistan\u2019s Chinese-backed ISR systems, which enhanced battlefield precision.\n\nChina\u2019s military support for Pakistan has increased significantly in recent years. Since 2020, it has accounted for 81 percent of Islamabad\u2019s military imports.\n\nFor years, some Indian defence analysts warned that India\u2019s military was unprepared for a China-supported Pakistan, given its limited US or Russian backing for its high-risk Kashmir gamble. Others criticised the government\u2019s foreign policy for encouraging China-Pakistan rapprochement. Their warnings remained unheeded in New Delhi.\n\nThe events of the past few days exposed India\u2019s strategic limits, replacing ambiguity with global scrutiny. The kneejerk reaction in New Delhi may be to increase the defence budget and deepen even further the militarisation of Kashmir.\n\nAs the Indian government plans its next steps, it should do well to consider that the status quo of shadow war and the cycle of covert aggression fuelling unrest is untenable. Both nations\u2019 intelligence agencies have long backed proxies, driving instability from Kashmir to Afghanistan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe path forward rests on New Delhi and Islamabad making wise choices. Restraint, not rhetoric, should shape policies moving forward. Failure to do so risks geopolitical turmoil, economic stagnation and hardship for millions.

    "title": "Mortgage and refinance rates today, May 11, 2025: Economic data could shift mortgage rates",
    "body": "Mortgage interest rates are up today. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has risen by one basis point to 6.72%, and the 15-year fixed rate has increased by seven basis points to 6.03%.\n\nMortgage rates typically go up when the U.S. economy thrives and down when the economy struggles. A lot of economic data will be released this upcoming week, especially surrounding inflation. This data could move home loan rates one way or the other \u2014 however, it probably won't cause any dramatic shifts.\n\nDig deeper: How inflation impacts mortgage rates\n\nHave questions about buying, owning, or selling a house? Submit your question to Yahoo's panel of Realtors using this Google form.\n\nCurrent mortgage rates\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\n30-year fixed: 6.72%\n\n20-year fixed: 6.50%\n\n15-year fixed: 6.03%\n\n5/1 ARM: 7.11%\n\n7/1 ARM: 7.41%\n\n30-year VA: 6.29%\n\n15-year VA: 5.70%\n\n5/1 VA: 6.33%\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nCurrent mortgage refinance rates\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\n30-year fixed: 6.75%\n\n20-year fixed: 6.26%\n\n15-year fixed: 6.06%\n\n5/1 ARM: 7.51%\n\n7/1 ARM: 7.33%\n\n30-year VA: 6.28%\n\n15-year VA: 5.88%\n\n5/1 VA: 6.48%\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nRead more: Is now a good time to refinance your mortgage?\n\nRefinance interest rates\n\nMonthly mortgage payment calculator\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nOur free mortgage calculator also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\n30-year vs. 15-year fixed mortgage rates\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.72%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 6.03% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you\u2019ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that\u2019s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet\u2019s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 6.72% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,940, and you\u2019d pay $398,334 in interest over the life of your loan \u2014 on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 6.03% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,536. But you\u2019d only pay $156,558 in interest over the years.\n\nFixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it\u2019s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nDig deeper: Fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages\n\nHow to get a low mortgage rate\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn\u2019t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you\u2019re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nHow to choose a mortgage lender\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame \u2014 doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don\u2019t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) \u2014 this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn more: Best mortgage lenders for first-time home buyers\n\nCurrent mortgage rates: FAQs\n\nWhat is a mortgage interest rate at right now?\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.72%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 6.03%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nWhat's a good mortgage rate right now?\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.72% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\n\nAre mortgage rates expected to drop?\n\nMortgage rates aren't expected to drop drastically in the near future, though they may inch down here and there.",

    "body": "Most people spend countless hours planning their retirement before the big day finally arrives. After all, it\u2019s not always easy to feel completely confident before you exit the workforce and enter your golden years.\n\nWith that in mind, here are six milestones you should aim to hit in order to feel more confident in your retirement plan.\n\nDon't miss\n\n1. Comprehensive income and expense plan\n\nOne of the biggest concerns for retirees is whether they have enough money to survive without a paycheck.\n\nFinancial advisors often cite the 'rule of 25', which states that you can expect to retire comfortably if your assets are worth at least 25 times your annual expenses. However, this rule of thumb doesn\u2019t guarantee how much you can spend each year, or how much income your assets will realistically generate every year in retirement.\n\nIt\u2019s likely better to consult a professional financial advisor who can help you create a customized plan that accounts for your income, investments and expenses. A financial advisor can also help you change or modify your plan after you retire.\n\n2. Debt elimination\n\nCarrying debt without employment income doesn\u2019t often make for a fun retirement and, unfortunately, many retirees live with this unpleasant burden.\n\nAccording to a survey from National Debt Relief, 72% of Americans over 55 have accumulated some debt, with more than half admitting it\u2019s \u201cheld them back\u201d in life.\n\nWith this in mind, you should plan to eliminate or minimize your non-mortgage debt before you retire.\n\n3. Healthcare plan\n\nOne of the reasons many seniors have debt is because of unexpected medical expenses. The same National Debt Relief survey found that roughly 17% of seniors carry an average of $9,144 in debt due to outstanding medical bills.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate just how expensive medical bills can be in your senior years. With this in mind, you\u2019d be wise to set up a robust plan to deal with these medical costs before you retire.\n\nRead more: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has an important message for the next wave of American retirees \u2014 here's how he says you can best weather the US retirement crisis\n\n4.

    "body": "As your first year of retirement progresses, it\u2019s important to evaluate whether the financial plan you laid out to ensure your sustainable well-being is going according to plan. An appropriate plan should include tax calculations to understand how much of your income will truly be at your disposal for needs and wants.\n\nSome people may think that because you pay for Social Security benefits throughout your lifetime via payroll taxes, it\u2019s a tax-free benefit. However, this is often not the case. Both the amount of your Social Security benefits subject to taxes and the tax rate itself will depend on a handful of factors personal to your situation.\n\nTo build your own retirement income plan and tax strategy, talk to a fiduciary financial advisor today.\n\nHow Your Social Security Benefits Are Taxed\n\nIn short, you might pay taxes on 0%, 50% or 85% of your Social Security retirement benefits. This is depending on your provisional income, though:\n\nProvisional income = Taxable income + Tax-exempt interest + \u00bd of annual Social Security benefits\n\nYou then would compare your provisional income to that year\u2019s income threshold to determine what portion of your Social Security benefits will be taxed. Your tax rate will be your marginal rate. For a single filer, the thresholds are as follows:\n\nSmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor example, if you had $25,000 in 401(k) withdrawals, $5,000 in tax-exempt bond interest and $29,000 in annual Social Security benefits, your provisional income would be:\n\n\n\n$25,000 + $5,000 + (\u00bd x $29,000) = $44,500\n\nBecause this is beyond the $34,000 income threshold, 85% of your Social Security income will be taxed.\n\nSo, nearly $25,000 of your Social Security benefits ($29,000 x 0.85 = $24,650) for the year would be taxable in this case. Again, that\u2019s only the amount of money you\u2019ll be charged taxes on \u2013 not what you\u2019re actually paying in taxes. The other roughly $4,000 would be tax-free.\n\nTalk to a financial advisor about building a strategy to minimize taxes in retirement.\n\nDelaying 401(k) and IRA Distributions\n\nIn some cases, it may make sense to reduce your other income streams to prevent additional taxation of your Social Security benefits. While some advisors may recommend their client delays taking Social Security as long as possible to get increased benefits, it might be helpful to reduce the tax liability on Social Security income by delaying other income streams instead. For instance, you could push back distributions from a 401(k) or traditional IRA.",

    "title": "Is $2,000 a Year Too Expensive for Long-Term Care Insurance?",
    "body": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nLong-term care insurance is an important way to mitigate risk in retirement. Unexpected health issues and the related costs can take over a retiree\u2019s financial life if they don\u2019t have a plan to pay for costs of care. The cost of such a policy will depend on a handful of factors \u2013 including your age and coverage level \u2013 so whether you should accept a $2,000 annual premium depends entirely on your personal profile.\n\nIf you are buying early, this price might be a little high. In your 50\u2019s, a policy can cost between $1,000 and $2,000 per year depending on what you need according to data from the American Association for Long Term Care Insurance.\n\nIf you waited until retirement, this price is quite low. In your 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s a long-term care insurance policy can cost between $2,000 and $4,500 per year depending on your various coverage options.\n\nPlanning for all of your retirement needs early can have a big impact on your finances. Talk to a financial advisor today to build a personal plan.\n\nWhat Is Long-Term Care Insurance?\n\nLong-term care insurance is a policy that pays for ongoing support services.\n\nMost often long-term care will pay for either in-home assistance, such as a visiting nurse, or stays in a medical facility, such as assisted living or a nursing home. Most people need insurance, Medicaid or some other source of funds to pay for this. Depending on the nature of your services, long-term care can cost between $5,000 and $8,000 per month plus additional expenses.\n\nFor Many Policies, $2,000 Is Very Reasonable\n\nAll of this returns to our headline question, is $2,000 per year a reasonable price for long-term care insurance?\n\nThe answer is, it depends. Returning to the data from the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, a few average policy prices for representative profiles include:\n\nAge 55, Single Male, $165,000 Coverage, No Inflation \u2013 $900/year\n\nAge 55, Single Female, $165,000 Coverage, No Inflation \u2013 $1,500/year\n\nAge 55, Single Male, $165,000 Coverage, 2% Inflation \u2013 $1,650/year\n\nAge 55, Single Female, $165,000 Coverage, 2% Inflation \u2013 $2,725\n\nSo, say you are a woman in her 50\u2019s who would like a policy that adjusts for benchmark inflation. With that profile, $2,000 per month is a good deal. On the other hand, $2,000 per year is somewhat overpriced for a similarly-situated man.\n\nThen there are the prices if you wait until retirement age:",

    "title": "I'm 50 With $650K in a 401(k). Should I Max Out the 24% Bracket With Annual Roth Conversions?",
    "body": "When you make a Roth conversion, you add the entire amount converted to your taxable income for that year. For example, say that you convert $100,000 from your 401(k) to a Roth IRA in 2024. Your taxable income for 2024 would increase by $100,000. This means that part of making a Roth conversion is ensuring you have the cash on hand to pay the increased taxes. If you are over the age of 59 1/2, you can take that cash from the funds you are converting, which will in turn reduce your portfolio's capital. If not, you will need cash from other sources.\n\nRoth conversions are when you move money from an existing, qualified pre-tax retirement account, like a 401(k) or a traditional IRA, and put it in a Roth IRA. There is no limit to how much money you can convert, so long as it comes from a qualified pre-tax portfolio. Mechanically, this is a simple transfer. You either direct deposit the assets from one account to the other, or you withdraw the funds and then deposit them in the other account.\n\nA Roth IRA is a post-tax retirement account. This means that you fund it with money on which you have already paid income taxes. You get no tax breaks related to funding the Roth account. However, you then pay no further taxes on these assets. The funds grow tax-free, like with all retirement accounts, and in retirement you can withdraw this money with no income taxes. This can make a Roth IRA the best retirement account on the market for the right investor.\n\nHere are some things to think about. A financial advisor can also give you personalized guidance based on your circumstances and goals.\n\nFor example, say that you're 50 years old with $650,000 in your 401(k). A Roth IRA will have plenty of time to keep growing tax free before you retire in, say, 10 to 15 years. How would it work if you move just enough income each year to stay under the mid-tier 24% tax bracket? How about if you move enough to stay within 24%?\n\nIf you're making a Roth conversion, you\u2019ll incur conversion taxes. A good way to help manage this is by staggering your conversions, moving a little bit at a time to minimize your tax brackets.\n\nUnder the right circumstances, a Roth IRA can be the best retirement account for tax management. On the back end, you simply can't beat the offer of no income taxes or required minimum distributions (RMDs) in retirement. The catch is the front end, when you pay taxes that might otherwise have boosted your portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStaggered Roth Conversions\n\nThe most common way to manage conversion taxes is a practice known as staggered conversions. This is when you convert money in smaller amounts each year to keep your taxable income lower. This, in turn, helps keep down your tax brackets, so that your money gets taxed at a lower overall effective rate.\n\nFor example, let's say you have $100,000 to convert. Using the 2024 tax brackets as an example, the 12% tax bracket applies to individual income between $11,600 and $47,150. The 22% tax bracket begins at income above $47,150. For the sake of example, we can set aside any other household income.\n\nIf you convert $100,000 all at once, you will pay taxes up to 22%, for an approximate effective rate of 13.79% and taxes of $13,007. On the other hand, say you convert your money over in $47,150 installments (with a $5,700 remainder in the third year). This would expose your money to a maximum 12% tax rate, for an effective rate of 8.01% and total taxes of $7,552. You almost halve your taxes with staggered, installment conversions as opposed to a lump sum in this case.\n\nHowever, when it comes to installment conversions, many investors forget a critical issue: Your money will continue growing while you make these conversions. For the Roth account, this means that the sooner you convert your funds, the more untaxed growth you will enjoy. For the pre-tax account, this means that the longer you take to convert your funds, the more taxed money you will ultimately need to convert.\n\nA financial advisor can help you plan and execute a Roth conversion. Get matched today.\n\nHow Should You Convert a $650,000 401(k)?\n\nSo, let's return to our question. You're 50 years old with $650,000 in your 401(k). We'll assume that you are an unmarried individual and that your portfolio grows at a stable 8% mixed-asset rate of return. (There are no guarantees with investing. We will just use this number for the sake of example.)\n\nFirst, should you convert your money each year up to the 24% income bracket? It\u2019ll depend on your circumstances, including the other taxable income you are living on each year.\n\nThe 24% tax bracket ends at $191,950 in our example, so you will need to keep your combined (earned and converted) taxable income at or below this number to stay below the 32% bracket.\n\nOr, say you want to make this conversion over 10 years, so that it is finished by the time you turn 60. To do this, you will need to account both for your current portfolio and any growth during that time, while still balancing your tax brackets by monitoring your earned and converted income.\n\nSo, in the alternative, should you convert your money each year to stay within the 24% tax bracket? That is, should you convert only enough to stay within this bracket?\n\nThis plan makes sense, but depending on your income it might still be tight. The 24% bracket is one of the tax code's odd cliffs, with the next bracket jumping all the way up to 32%, so you'll save real money by sticking to 24%.\n\nHowever, you still need to consider your timeline. If you want to convert your money in less than 10 years, even staying within 24% might require an unrealistically low level of earned income. For example, say that you want to convert this entire portfolio within five years. This would require withdrawals of slightly more than $160,000 per year, accounting for portfolio growth. That's only possible if you make less than $31,950 per year.\n\nWithin the 24% tax bracket this plan is possible, but it depends entirely on your time frame. If you want to convert your assets before age 60, this still might require less household income than you're likely to have.\n\nConsider speaking with a financial advisor for help building and executing a plan for your retirement income and taxes.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA Roth IRA conversion can be a great way to manage your taxes, but it's important to fully understand the implications of this move. For example, when you plan the timeline of your conversion, don't forget to account for offsetting portfolio growth. Otherwise, you might find yourself relying on unrealistic assumptions.\n\nTips on Retirement Portfolio Tax Management\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/Chainarong Prasertthai\n\nThe post I\u2019m 50 With $650k in My 401(k).

Trump floated a rate of 80%, down from 145%, on social media.\n\nAnd your portfolio is looking much better compared to the week after \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d You also have hope the good vibes will continue \u2014 am I right?\n\nAgainst this backdrop, I want to highlight two things about investing I was reminded of at the Milken conference this past week.\n\nLet them be a sanity check on the bullishness you are feeling at the moment, which to me is a little too much given the uncertain environment and the facts corporate America is bringing to the table this earnings season.\n\nThe first comes from billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square fame.\n\nAckman offered this up (video above) when I asked him about tariffs impacting the businesses he owns a piece of, such as Nike (NKE) and Chipotle (CMG): \"So we care about the value of a business. The value of a business is the present value of the future cash flows. What's going on now certainly could be disruptive in the short term. I don't think it's likely to have permanent effects.\"\n\nI think you can read this from Ackman in a few different ways.\n\nYours truly talks with Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman (right) about Trump's trade war, the outlook for stocks and a new $900 million investment in real estate play Howard Hughes at the Milken conference this week. \u00b7 Yahoo Finance\n\nMost of you will likely view it favorably, as it implies future cash flows of companies will be just fine even if tariffs stay in place. I, however, believe Ackman is signaling investors may be too optimistic in the short term, given how disruptive to profits and cash flows tariffs could be.\n\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\n\nKeep in mind, we are getting zero indication that tariffs will be completely removed on countries, just that they may be lowered. That means more unplanned costs for a business to contend with.\n\nThe next investing reminder comes from Nuveen chief investment officer Saira Malik, who oversees $1 trillion at the giant asset manager:\n\n\"I think confusion is probably a word to describe it [the investing backdrop],\" Malik said. \"Investors want clarity here, and that would be helpful. You can do calculations if you know where the tariffs are going to end up. So, as an example, our calculations show that if tariffs were at about 10% for the rest of the world, it would hit GDP by 1.5%. You just skirt a recession there.\"",

    "title": "How much inventory did companies actually build ahead of tariffs?",
    "body": "\u201cCompanies typically maintain about 3 months of inventory,\u201d Chadha wrote. \u201cThey have been raising that buffer over the last 10 years, especially since the COVID pandemic supply chain disruptions, and the lowest levels in the last 10 years have been about 2 months, which suggests companies could run their buffers down for a month at most in hopes for a tariff reprieve.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn clear evidence of pre-buying, goods imports surged in Q1, especially in March, but relative to the prior run rate of $275bn a month, we estimate the excess imports over the last 3 months were about $190bn, or around 3 weeks extra,\u201c Chadha wrote in his May 2 research note.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Binky Chadha analyzed the data to estimate how much extra inventory companies have accumulated.\n\n\u201cAs a precaution, we've taken steps to build inventory in certain markets to mitigate potential tariff impact in the short term.\u201c - WD-40\n\n\u201cWe built some inventory where possible in certain items as we anticipate that to happen. So that gives a little relief of amounts needed to in some of the items. But the impact should be mostly concentrated in the second half.\u201d - Kraft Heinz\n\n\u201cWe've done some forward buys of inventory where we're the first-party seller. Our third-party sellers have pulled forward a number of items, so they have inventory here as well.\u201d - Amazon\n\n\u201cFor transparency, you will see that we did build ahead inventory, and that's reflected in our manufacturing purchase obligations that you'll see on the quarterly filing when it comes out.\u201c - Apple\n\n\u201cLooking outside the U.S., demand for U.S. inbound services surged as customers pull forward inventory purchases ahead of expected tariff changes.\u201d - UPS\n\n\u201cOur clients are getting ready. We're seeing some accelerating of imports to stockpile inventories.\u201d - Citigroup\n\nVarious anecdotes from companies and a spike in imports at the beginning of this year suggest this pull-forward could be significant . Here are some notable quotes from Q1 earnings season:\n\nOne of the actions some companies have taken to mitigate the impact of future tariffs has been to pulling forward expected future purchases and stockpiling goods before costs go up.\n\nA big economic question right now : To what degree does today\u2019s economic activity reflect a pull forward of purchases that would\u2019ve occurred further down the road?\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn other words, companies were already carrying extra inventory before President Trump unveiled his aggressive view on tariffs.\n\n\u201cExcess imports combined with inventory rundowns gives companies about 1 to 2 months before the tariff impacts start to bite,\u201d Chadha said.\n\nCompanies are preparing for tariff uncertainty by buying inventory two-to-three months out. \u00b7 Bloomberg\n\nSo while Chadha\u2019s estimate of \u201cabout 1 to 2 months\u201c of buffer for S&P 500 companies is arguably significant, it doesn\u2019t even buy a quarter\u2019s worth of time.\n\nSome analysts think it\u2019s less \u231b\ufe0f\n\nIn a separate analysis of retailer inventories, BofA analysts expressed skepticism toward the idea that warehouses are well stocked. From their note (emphasis added):\n\n\u201cThere was a surge in imports of consumer goods into the U.S. in March, according to Census Bureau data. Does this mean retailers' inventories are set to swell? In our view, no. The ratio of retailers' inventories to their monthly sales was not especially high in recent data to begin with. And at the same time, consumers also appear to have been buying ahead, with Bank of America internal data showing strength in consumer durables spending in March and April. Moreover, Bank of America internal data on retailers' payments to transportation and shipping companies does not suggest a big ramp up in inventories. And it appears container shipments into Los Angeles are likely down in May. So we think it is possible retail inventories may actually look 'lean' in coming months.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the most recent retail inventories data from the Census only goes through February. So those particular figures are a bit stale.\n\nRetain inventories loooked lean heading into tariff uncertainty. \u00b7 BofA\n\nThat said, BofA makes a good point about consumers \u201cbuying ahead.\u201d This suggests that a lot of goods left warehouses as quickly as they came in. This is consistent with government data on consumer spending, which has been very strong.\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 David Kostin analyzed the S&P 500 and came to a similar conclusion.\n\n\u201c1Q data do not show a buildup of inventories,\u201d Kostin wrote on Friday. \u201cThe S&P 500 inventory to sales ratio declined year/year, with the largest declines in the Autos and Consumer Durables & Apparel industries. However, many retailers have yet to report 1Q results.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 inventory-to-sales ratio declined, with the largest declines in autos, consumer durables, and apparel. \u00b7 Goldman Sachs\n\nThe March retail sales report showed an unusual spike in autos sales, which supports the idea that consumers pulled forward purchases to front-run tariffs.\n\nTo Kostin\u2019s point about fresh data, retailers will be announcing their Q1 results in the coming weeks. On Thursday morning we get Walmart\u2019s earnings. That day also comes with the April retail sales and March inventories reports. Everyone will be watching for clues about inventory builds as well as how much inventory was cleared out by sales pulled forward.\n\nZooming out \ud83d\udd2d\n\nEven if we had a more clear understanding of inventory levels, the bigger issue continues to be the uncertainty around tariffs.\n\nIf we ultimately get very high tariffs, then inventory stockpiling would\u2019ve been a good move. If any new tariffs are low, then inventory stockpiling could prove to be a costly error.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that proposed tariffs or any tariff deals continue to get delayed, and this uncertainty nightmare persists.\n\nThe big picture \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\n\nThese are uncertain times.\n\nThe economic data is sending ambiguous signals. Managers are having an unusually hard time forecasting the near future for the businesses. And investors and analysts are having an unusually hard time modeling where stock prices are headed in the coming months and quarters.\n\nIt\u2019s periods like this where long-term investors have an edge: Time.\n\n\u201cNobody knows what the market is going to do tomorrow, next week, next month,\u201d Warren Buffett said last week. But as he often does, he argued, \u201cThe long-term trend is up.\u201c\n\nThere\u2019s basically three scenarios investors always have to consider: 1) Things improve from here, and the market goes up; 2) Things get worse before they get better, which means markets could fall before resuming a more firm rally; or 3) Things get worse and never get better.\n\nIf we\u2019re facing scenario 3, then we may have bigger problems than stocks not recovering. But scenario 3 has never played out.\n\nScenarios 1 and 2 favor long-term investors. Maybe things get worse before they get better. (Note: Timing market bottoms is nearly impossible.) But staying long the stock market covers you in case the low of this cycle is behind us.\n\nReview of the macro crosscurrents \ud83d\udd00\n\nThere were several notable data points and macroeconomic developments since our last review:\n\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Fed holds rates, Powell warns on tariffs. In its monetary policy announcement on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve left its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\nFederal Reserve left its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. \u00b7 FRED\n\nFrom the Fed\u2019s policy statement: \u201cAlthough swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. \u2026 Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Wednesday, May 7, 2025, at the Federal Reserve in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nHere\u2019s what Fed Chair Powell said about tariffs during the post-meeting press conference: \u201cIf the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment.\u201c\n\nFor more on how tariff rhetoric is affecting the economy, read: CHART: The confusing state of the economy \ud83d\udcca and We're gonna get ambiguous signals in the economic data \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\n\n\ud83d\udcb3 Card spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: \u201cAs of 29 Apr 2025, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 2.2% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 29 Apr 2025, our estimate of the US Census April control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.46%.\u201d\n\nCredit card spending is incfeasing on a YOY basis. \u00b7 JPMorgan\n\nFrom BofA: \u201cCredit and debit card spending per household increased 1% year-over-year (YoY) in April after a gain of 1.1% YoY in March, according to Bank of America aggregated card data. Seasonally adjusted (SA) spending per household was flat month-over-month (MoM), with the seasonally adjusted annualized growth rate (SAAR) remaining at 1.6% again for April.\u201c\n\nConsumer spending is up 1.6% on an annualized basis for April. \u00b7 BofA\n\nApril spending is likely being boosted by consumers pulling forward purchases in an attempt to front-run tariffs.\n\nFor more on consumer spending, read: We're gonna get ambiguous signals in the economic data \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab and Americans have money, and they're spending it \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udcbc Unemployment claims tick lower.

From the New York Fed\u2019s April Survey of Consumer Expectations: \u201cMedian inflation expectations were unchanged at the one-year-ahead horizon at 3.6% and increased by 0.2 percentage point at the three-year-ahead horizon to 3.2%, the highest reading since July 2022. In contrast, median inflation expectations decreased by 0.2 percentage point at the five-year-ahead horizon to 2.7%.\u201d\n\nMedian inflation expectations were unchanged at the one-year-ahead. \u00b7 NY Fed\n\nThe introduction of tariffs as proposed by president-elect Donald Trump would be inflationary.

From AAA: \u201cIn the lull between spring travel and the kick-off to summer, gas demand slid week over week, dropping the national average three cents to land at $3.15. OPEC+ (the group of oil-producing countries) announced Saturday that it will increase output again in June, widening the supply surplus, which could cause crude prices to continue to fall. This means road trippers would see lower prices at the pump this summer. The national average is nearly 49 cents less than it was one year ago today.\u201d\n\nGas prices are ticking lower. \u00b7 AAA\n\nFor more on energy prices, read: Higher oil prices meant something different in the past \ud83d\udee2\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Used car prices rise. From Manheim: \u201cWholesale used-vehicle prices (on a mix, mileage, and seasonally adjusted basis) were much higher in April compared to March. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index (MUVVI) increased to 208.2, an increase of 4.9% from a year ago and also higher than March levels by 2.7%. This is the highest reading for the index since October 2023.\u201d\n\nThe Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index (MUVVI) increased to 208.2, an increase of 4.9% from a year ago. \u00b7 Manheim\n\n\ud83e\udd11 Wage growth is cool.

From the BLS: \u201cNonfarm business sector labor productivity decreased 0.8% in the first quarter of 2025 \u2026 as output decreased 0.3% and hours worked increased 0.6%. \u2026 This is the first decline in nonfarm business sector labor productivity since the second quarter of 2022.

According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged at 6.76%. From Freddie Mac: \u201cMortgage rates stayed flat this week. At this time last year, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 30 basis points higher and purchase applications were declining. Today, rates are lower and have remained stable for weeks, sparking continued increases in purchase applications.\u201d\n\nThere are 147.8 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.1 million are owner-occupied and about 34.1 million of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to movements in home prices or mortgage rates.\n\nFor more on mortgages and home prices, read: Why home prices and rents are creating all sorts of confusion about inflation \ud83d\ude16\n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb Services surveys were mixed. From S&P Global\u2019s May U.S. Services PMI: \u201cWhile tariff announcements mean manufacturing dominates the news, a worrying backstory is developing in the vastly larger services economy, where business activity and hiring have come closer to stalling in April amid plunging business confidence. Business and consumer facing service providers alike, and especially financial services firms, are reporting markedly weaker growth prospects, citing intensifying uncertainty over the economic outlook amid recent tariff announcements and ongoing federal spending cuts.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile, the ISM\u2019s Services PMI improved slightly in April.\n\nKeep in mind that during times of perceived stress, soft survey data tends to be more exaggerated than actual hard data.\n\nFor more on soft sentiment data, read: The confusing state of the economy \ud83d\udcca and What businesses do > what businesses say \ud83d\ude4a\n\n\ud83d\udea2 Trade deficit balloons as imports surge. Here\u2019s Bloomberg on March Census data: \u201cThe US trade deficit widened to a record in March as companies rushed to import products including pharmaceuticals as the Trump administration readied sweeping tariffs. The goods and services trade gap grew 14% from the prior month to $140.5 billion, Commerce Department data showed Tuesday. \u2026 Imports of consumer goods climbed by the most on record, primarily due to the largest-ever inflow of pharmaceutical preparations. Imports of capital equipment and motor vehicles also increased.\n\nFrom Bloomberg\u2019s Michael McDonough: \u201cPharmaceutical imports led the surge, soaring to a record high in March as U.S. companies rushed to stock up before tariffs hit. Imports of medicines, vaccines, and blood-related products saw the biggest increases, highlighting companies' urgency to secure supplies.\u201c\n\nFor more on the implications of purchases pulled forward ahead of tariffs, read: A BIG economic question right now \ud83e\udd14 and CHART: The confusing state of the economy \ud83d\udcca\n\n\u26d3\ufe0f Supply chain pressures remain loose. The New York Fed\u2019s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index \u2014 a composite of various supply chain indicators \u2014 ticked lower in April and remains near historically normal levels.

From Kastle Systems: \u201cPeak day office occupancy was 63.3% on Tuesday last week, down six tenths of a point from the previous week. New York and Washington, D.C. hit new single-day record highs, up 2.7 points to 69.3% and one full point to 63.4%, respectively. Several other cities experienced losses, led by Dallas, where occupancy on Tuesday fell 4.4 points to 67.1%.

The Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model sees real GDP growth rising at a 2.3% rate in Q2.\n\nPutting it all together \ud83e\udd14\n\n\ud83d\udea8 The tariffs announced by President Trump as they stand threaten to upend global trade \u2014 with significant implications for the U.S. economy, corporate earnings, and the stock market. Until we get some more clarity, here\u2019s where things stand:\n\nEarnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\n\nDemand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, while cooling, also remains positive, and the Federal Reserve \u2014 having resolved the inflation crisis \u2014 has shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\n\nBut growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \u201ccoiled\u201d these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.\n\nActions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period given that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor\u2019s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\n\nStocks are not the economy: Analysts expect the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy, thanks largely due to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have adjusted their cost structures aggressively. This has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth \u2014 in the cooling economy \u2014 is translating to robust earnings growth.\n\nMind the ever-present risks: Of course, this does not mean we should get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about \u2014 such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, cyber attacks, etc. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\n\nInvesting is never a smooth ride: There\u2019s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect to experience as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\n\nThink long term: For now, there\u2019s no reason to believe there\u2019ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won\u2019t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it\u2019s a streak long-term investors can expect to continue.\n\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co",

    "body": "Stocks ended last week slightly down after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's wait-and-see approach to interest rate policy and President Trump unveiled a trade deal between the US and UK.\n\nAll three major indexes finished last week in the red, as trade volatility moved stock charts. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank about 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gave up about 0.3%.\n\nThe week ahead will bring a fresh update on inflation, with the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday, as well as the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday. Retail sales will offer a read on the health of the American consumer. And investors will also be on the lookout for advancing trade deals, following a limited, bilateral pact with the UK.\n\nChina, the nation's third-largest trading partner, is also top of mind. US officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent huddled with Chinese officials this past weekend in Geneva, with the aim of de-escalating tensions and coming to some preliminary understanding. On Friday President Trump floated the idea of slashing China tariffs to 80%. Such an overture might invite Beijing to react with a tariff reduction of their own.\n\nInflation after 'Liberation Day'\n\nNew inflation data coming this week will offer investors the latest look at pricing pressures.\n\nThe readings carry significance because they will be among the first bits of \"hard\" economic data that captures, at least in part, the time period since Trump imposed heavy tariffs on the country's trading partners. Should the data show heightened pressures, it will bolster the case that the costs of a high-tariff regime are being born by American consumers, sapping their purchasing power. Producer prices can also offer a look at inflation before those costs hit consumers, revealing where prices are heading.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to increase 0.3% for the month of April compared to the prior month. In March, headline prices fell from the prior month for the first time since 2020. On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices are expected to climb 0.3% over the prior month and 2.8% compared to the same period last year.\n\nFed officials wait and watch\n\nThe Federal Reserve will be watching inflation data alongside the rest of us.\n\nLast week, policymakers at the central bank voted to keep rates where they are, citing the need for more data \u2014 and time \u2014 to understand the impacts of the tariffs, which are also still in flux.",

    "body": "Find out how much you could earn with today\u2019s savings rates. The Federal Reserve cut its target rate three times in late 2024, which means savings interest rates are falling from their historic highs. It\u2019s important to be sure you\u2019re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a savings account. The following is a breakdown of savings interest rates today and where to find the best offers.\n\nOverview of savings interest rates today\n\nThe national average savings account rate stands at 0.41%, according to the FDIC. This might not seem like much, but consider that three years ago, it was just 0.06%, reflecting a sharp rise in a short period of time.\n\nToday, the highest savings account rate available from our partners today is 4.36% APY. This rate is offered by VIO Bank and there is no minimum opening deposit required.\n\nSince these rates may not be around much longer, consider opening a high-yield savings account now to take advantage of today\u2019s high rates.\n\nHere is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nHow much interest can I earn with a savings account?\n\nThe amount of interest you can earn from a savings account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (savings account interest typically compounds daily).\n\nSay you put $1,000 in a savings account at the average interest rate of 0.41% with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $1,004.11 \u2014 your initial $1,000 deposit, plus just $4.11 in interest.\n\nNow let\u2019s say you choose a high-yield savings account that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.81 over the same period, which includes $40.81 in interest.\n\nThe more you deposit in a savings account, the more you stand to earn.

    "title": "Best CD rates today, May 11, 2025 (lock in up to 4.40% APY)",
    "body": "Find out how much you could earn by locking in a high CD rate today. A certificate of deposit (CD) allows you to lock in a competitive rate on your savings and help your balance grow. However, rates vary widely across financial institutions, so it\u2019s important to ensure you\u2019re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a CD. The following is a breakdown of CD rates today and where to find the best offers.\n\nOverview of CD rates today\n\nHistorically, longer-term CDs offered higher interest rates than shorter-term CDs. Generally, this is because banks would pay better rates to encourage savers to keep their money on deposit longer. However, in today\u2019s economic climate, the opposite is true.\n\nToday, the highest CD rate 4.40% APY, offered by Marcus by Goldman Sachs on its 14-month CD. There is a $500 minimum opening deposit required.\n\nNexBank also offers 4.40% APY on its 1-year CD. However, a minimum deposit of $25,000 is required.\n\nHere is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners:\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nHow much interest can I earn with a CD?\n\nThe amount of interest you can earn from a CD depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (CD interest typically compounds daily or monthly).\n\nSay you invest $1,000 in a one-year CD with 1.81% APY, and interest compounds monthly. At the end of that year, your balance would grow to $1,018.25 \u2014 your initial $1,000 deposit, plus $18.25 in interest.\n\nNow let\u2019s say you choose a one-year CD that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.74 over the same period, which includes $40.74 in interest.\n\nThe more you deposit in a CD, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a one-year CD at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance when the CD matures would be $10,407.42, meaning you\u2019d earn $407.42 in interest. \u200b\u200b\n\nRead more: What is a good CD rate?\n\nTypes of CDs\n\nWhen choosing a CD, the interest rate is usually top of mind. However, the rate isn\u2019t the only factor you should consider. There are several types of CDs that offer different benefits, though you may need to accept a slightly lower interest rate in exchange for more flexibility. Here\u2019s a look at some of the common types of CDs you can consider beyond traditional CDs:\n\nBump-up CD : This type of CD allows you to request a higher interest rate if your bank's rates go up during the account\u2019s term. However, you\u2019re usually allowed to \"bump up\" your rate just once.\n\nNo-penalty CD : Also known as a liquid CD, type of CD gives you the option to withdraw your funds before maturity without paying a penalty.\n\nJumbo CD : These CDs require a higher minimum deposit (usually $100,000 or more), and often offer higher interest rate in return. In today\u2019s CD rate environment, however, the difference between traditional and jumbo CD rates may not be much.\n\nBrokered CD: As the name suggests, these CDs are purchased through a brokerage rather than directly from a bank. Brokered CDs can sometimes offer higher rates or more flexible terms, but they also carry more risk and might not be FDIC-insured.",

Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) led gains, rocketing up 3.6%.\n\nStocks were already making gains over after the US said it had made \"substantial progress\" in weekend trade talks with China, raising hopes of a potential deescalation in tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nThey took another sharp leg higher as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters the two sides had reached a deal for a 90-day pause in measures that would see tit-for-tat tariffs cut by 115%.\n\nThat brings the US rate on Chinese goods down to 30%, from 145% before the Geneva pact. China is lowering its retaliatory tariffs to 10%, from 125%.\n\nThe rally in futures comes after a downbeat week for stocks. All three major indexes fell last week, with the Dow snapping a two-week winning streak in the latest volatile action on Wall Street.\n\nInflation fears are gripping markets, with the impact of sweeping 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, a move met with retaliatory 125% duties from Beijing, coming to American consumers' pockets. Year-ahead inflation expectations sit at their highest level in more than 40 years.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added Sunday that the U.S. remains committed to a 10% baseline tariff rate on all imports to the US, signaling the administration\u2019s aggressive stance even as talks with more nations are underway.\n\nTraders will get their first sense of the initial inflationary effects of the tariffs with the release of key inflation data this week.

It was last at 20.37 points.\n\nMost megacap and growth stocks firmed in premarket trading, with Nvidia jumping 4.6% and Tesla adding 6.7%.\n\nChip stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Marvell Technology climbed 4.9% and 7.5%, respectively.\n\nCrude oil prices also surged over 3% after the U.S.-China announcement, lifting shares of top producers Chevron and Exxon Mobil about 2% higher each.\n\nThe deal between the United States and China comes days after a U.S.-UK limited trade agreement, easing fears that U.S. President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs announced on April 2 would roil global trade and spark a worldwide recession.\n\nAs of last close, the S&P 500 had erased almost all of its losses since April 2, helped along by some bright earnings reports and the trade optimism.\n\nPharmaceutical stocks, however, remained a casualty of tariff worries after Trump said on Sunday he plans to cut prescription prices to the level paid by other high-income countries, an amount he put at 30% to 80% lower.\n\nPfizer, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson all fell more than 2% each.\n\nRetail giant Walmart, network equipment maker Cisco and farm equipment maker Deere are some of the prominent companies set to report results this week.\n\nRetail inflation (CPI) data is due on Tuesday, while producer prices and retail sales will follow two days later.\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, are slated to make public remarks over the week.\n\n(Reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza)",

But with such impressive gains, which company looks like the better long-term AI stock? Here's what's going right with both companies, and what to look out for.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIonQ's biggest opportunity\n\nIonQ is first and foremost a quantum computing company. The company's quantum computers create a linear chain of ions that could eventually reach 100-plus qubits (a quantum computer's unit of processing) while delivering lower error rates than current quantum computers.\n\nIonQ has some overlap in the artificial intelligence (AI) space because quantum computers can be used to do things like AI model training. IonQ said recently that its quantum computers were used to train large language models (LLMs), and they enhanced the LLMs' understanding of the sentiment being communicated in sentences.\n\nThe big opportunity for IonQ is likely years away, though, as quantum computers may be potentially used to discover new materials, find cures for diseases, and advance climate science. Collectively, all the long-term prospects for quantum computing could create $850 billion in economic value by 2040, according to research from Boston Consulting Group.\n\nIt's important to note that while IonQ has gained significant investor attention, it's still a speculative investment. Quantum computing is still in its early stages, IonQ isn't profitable, and the company's revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis in the recently reported first quarter.\n\nWhat's going well for Palantir\n\nPalantir is an AI analytics company that makes its money from selling services in the commercial and government spaces. Both segments are growing fast for Palantir, with government revenue growth increasing 45% in the first quarter and commercial sales spiking 71%.\n\nEven more impressive was that Palantir's earnings doubled from the year-ago quarter to $0.08. The strong results led Palantir's management to raise its revenue guidance for the full year to about $3.9 billion, up from its previous estimate of $3.75 billion.",

    "body": "LONDON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Stocks and the dollar surged on Monday after the United States and China said they had agreed on a 90-day pause on tariffs and reciprocal duties would drop sharply, giving investors some confidence that a full-scale trade war may have been averted.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking after talks with Chinese officials in Geneva, told reporters the two sides had reached the deal that was outlined in a joint statement and that reciprocal rates would drop by 115 percentage points.\n\nThis weekend's meetings were the first face-to-face interactions between U.S. and Chinese officials since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to power and launched a global tariff blitz, imposing particularly hefty duties on China.\n\nMARKET REACTION:\n\nSTOCKS: Futures on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq jumped to trade up 2.8% and 3.5%, respectively, from gains of 1.5-2% previously, while in Europe, the STOXX 600 rose 0.7% in early trading.\n\nFOREX: The dollar extended gains, with the euro down 1.2% at $1.1164, having traded down 0.2% on the day earlier, while the yen weakened, leaving the U.S. currency up 1.6% at 147.715, from a 0.5% gain earlier.\n\nBONDS: Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose 7 basis points on the day to 4.44%, having traded up 5 bps before the joint statement.\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nJAN VON GERICH, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, NORDEA, HELSINKI:\n\n\"Markets have taken it at face value, I personally am a bit sceptical, if you want to end up with low tariffs then why do it like this? It\u2019s still bouncy, and uncertainty is elevated.\n\n\"I\u2019m still worried that there will be a last word, that now they\u2019ve come to an initial conclusion the details won\u2019t satisfy both sides, and there will be something else but, of course, time will tell. I would not take everything we hear at the moment at face value, that\u2019s what we saw on \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 (April 2 tariff announcement), and now, and it still bounces both ways.\"\n\nJANE FOLEY, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, RABOBANK, LONDON:\n\n\"The market reacted already overnight in anticipation of this, and we\u2019ve got a bit more details now, and it's continuing the tone it set overnight, where it\u2019s buying back the dollar. We have this scenario where the dollar is now being treated as a risky asset and is making gains.\n\n\"We\u2019ve had reassurance from the U.S. that negotiations will continue and that the tone of the negotiations have been positive and US and China don\u2019t want to decouple, so there is a lot more optimism that the tariffs won\u2019t have the devastating impact that perhaps they could have done, and there is a collective sigh of relief in markets.",

    "body": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's South32 on Monday named Matthew Daley to lead the diversified miner when long-serving CEO Graham Kerr steps down in 2026, with Daley in the interim joining as deputy chief executive officer early next year.\n\nDaley has more than 20 years of experience in the metals and mining industry and is expected to help the miner continue its base metals expansion. He will join South32 from Anglo American plc, where he is currently the technical and operations director, South32 said in a statement.\n\nHe joined London-listed Anglo American in 2017 as group head of mining, and has previously served as the executive general manager for Glencore's Canadian copper division.\n\nSouth32, like other miners, wants to grow in energy transition metal copper, and Daley's background at Glencore may help further that ambition. That comes after criticism by some investors that South32 has been too timid on M&A.\n\n\"What are we flagging, that they are going to buy some copper?\" said Chief Investment Officer Simon Mawhinney of Allan Gray. \"It might be a case of 'join the queue'.\"\n\nThe appointment comes amid a generational change among the world's top miners with BHP's Mike Henry expected to step down in the coming year.\n\n\"Matthew is a highly accomplished executive with extensive operational and leadership experience, including in copper and in the Americas, and the board is confident he is the right successor for Graham,\" South32 Chair Karen Wood said in the statement.\n\nKerr has helmed South32 since its split from BHP 10 years ago, making him among the longest serving mining CEOs, except for the near 20-year reign of Glencore's Ivan Glasenberg.\n\nOver that time, South32 has sold out of coal and bought into copper and other base metals, adding value to a tough portfolio of assets, although some investors have said he could have done it faster.\n\nThere is also a question mark about how successful his U.S. Hermosa base metals projects in Arizona will prove to be given a high capital cost. South32 approved $2.16 billion in capital investment last year.\n\nKerr told Reuters he will remain focused on a copper expansion at its Sierra Gorda joint venture in Chile and derisking Hermosa's Taylor project.\n\n\"We're still at that inflection point for the organisation where we're investing heavily in base metals,\" he said.\n\nKerr said it was time to move on after 10 years at the helm, but he hadn't thought much about life after South32, beyond taking a break.\n\n\"I can't imagine myself just playing golf, to be honest.\"\n\n(Reporting by Himanshi Akhand in Bengaluru; Editing by Tom Hogue, Himani Sarkar and Sonali Paul)",

    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Pakistan and India rallied as a ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbors calmed markets that had been shaken by military clashes on their border.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPakistan\u2019s stock benchmark KSE-30 Index surged as much as 9.2%, the most since 2008, in a rally that triggered an hour-long trading halt. The NSE Nifty 50 Index jumped as much as 3.5% in Mumbai, as both nations stepped back from the brink of war, allowing market participants to turn their focus back to the economic outlook for the South Asian nations.\n\n\u201cGiven how quickly things were escalating last week, the developments over the weekend are a move in the positive direction,\u201d said Brussels-based Vivek Dhawan, a fund manager at Candriam. \u201cThe focus could return to the Indian growth story.\u201d\n\nInvestors had been nervous. The Nifty slid more than 1% on Friday \u2014 its steepest fall in over a month \u2014 while the rupee was one of Asia\u2019s worst performers last week. Bond yields crept higher as risk premiums widened, although debt purchases by the Reserve Bank of India helped limit the declines. Pakistan\u2019s key stock index had tumbled 9% since the April 22 attack in Kashmir, which prompted India to retaliate.\n\nForeign investors, who had been on a 16-day buying streak until Friday, may resume inflows, drawn by India\u2019s positive economic signals, including prospects of an early US trade deal, ample liquidity, and anticipated interest rate cuts.\n\nThe Indian rupee rose as much as 0.9% versus the dollar in the offshore market. India\u2019s bonds and currency markets are closed on Monday for a public holiday. The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.\u2019s volatility gauge fell to 17.2, its lowest level since April 30. The five-most traded Nifty 50 options were all bullish, with May 25,000-rupee calls expiring Thursday clocking the highest volume.\n\nStill, the threat of renewed tensions remains, as India has yet to lift its abeyance on the Indus Water Treaty \u2014 a move that could harm a large part of Pakistan\u2019s farm output. Meanwhile, a top Indian diplomat said that Pakistan violated the truce just hours after it was declared, a claim Pakistan has denied.\n\n\u201cReports of violations within a few hours of the ceasefire announcement may cast some doubt on its sustainability,\u201d Barclays Bank Plc. strategists including Avanti Save wrote in a note. The UK bank retained overweight on Pakistan credit and expects a reversal in Indian rupee losses.",

    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Oil, base metals and crop commodities rallied while gold fell after China and the US agreed to lower tariffs on each other, following a weekend of trade talks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBrent crude added as much as 3.7% in London and copper rose 1.4%. European natural gas, soybeans and iron ore also rallied. Shares of the top mining companies surged. Meanwhile, bullion fell as haven demand eased.\n\nThe truce between the world\u2019s two largest economies brings relief to commodity markets roiled by prohibitive tariffs that dented the outlook for global growth in past weeks. Oil watchers have been slashing their demand forecasts and there have been signs in recent weeks that the trade war is already hitting the amount of goods arriving in the US.\n\nChina will reduce its tariffs on US goods to 10% from a level that climbed to 125% when the two nations began placing retaliatory restrictions on one another. The reduction will last for 90 days, while the US will reduce its own curbs to 30% from 145%.\n\nAt a briefing after the talks, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said neither nation wanted their economies to decouple. In a statement, the two countries said they would establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations.\n\nThe announcement came after a weekend of talks in Geneva involving Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts.\n\nThe lower levies are \u201creducing fears of a prolonged economic fallout hurting demand,\u201d said Ole Hansen head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank. \u201cThe key question is whether today\u2019s news marks peak optimism, given the low likelihood of a full U.S. retreat from its stance on China.\u201d\n\nOil prices are still down 13% since early April as the crude market also contends with rising supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies.\n\nShares of top miners including Glencore Plc and Rio Tinto Plc rose more than 5% in London. Miners also led gains in Europe\u2019s equity markets.\n\nCopper prices, which fell sharply after tariffs were first announced, have rebounded strongly on signs that demand is holding firm in China for now.\n\nSoybean futures in Chicago extended gains after the announcement, trading at the highest since late April. China is the world\u2019s top soybean buyer and the thaw could help re-open stalled crop flows between the nations. Cotton futures also jumped, rising as much as 2.7%.",

    "body": "By Anton Bridge\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese technology investor SoftBank Group is expected to book a quarterly net loss of 26.9 billion yen ($184.4 million) on Tuesday as early-stage tech startups fell out of favour and losses widened at major portfolio firms.\n\nThe forecast downgrades are seen by analysts as being partially offset by a stronger yen and the continued rise in the share price of SoftBank's telecommunications holdings, such as T-Mobile, which finished the quarter up more than 20%, close to a record high.\n\nThe net loss for the January-March quarter is based on the average of five analyst estimates compiled by LSEG and compares to net income of 231 billion yen over the same period the previous year.\n\nThe share price of portfolio companies such as Swiggy and Ola Electric each fell around 40% over the period. Losses at each have ballooned since their listings last year in the face of intense competition in the quick commerce and electric vehicle sectors.\n\nNomura Securities analyst Daisaku Masuno forecast a collective loss of around $900 million for listed companies held in SoftBank's Vision Fund investment vehicles over the quarter.\n\nNew venture capital investment concentrated in large established players over the quarter, while investment in earlier stage firms - such as those in the Vision Fund 2 - fell to the lowest level in five quarters, Crunchbase data showed.\n\nSoftBank played a part in this, making its largest spending announcements in years, including in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, in which it committed to investing between $20 billion and $30 billion.\n\nIn March SoftBank also announced its purchase of chip startup Ampere Computing for $6.5 billion.\n\nBut analysts doubt how much these planned investments in artificial intelligence will benefit its bottom line as these projects are yet to demonstrate tangible successes and competition is fierce.\n\n\"SoftBank has paid a steep price for ChatGPT perhaps without fully understanding how these increasing number of AI chatbots can coexist and make money,\" said Amir Anvarzadeh, Japan equity strategist at Asymmetric Investors.\n\nAlongside, recent market uncertainty has thrown the initial public offering market into retreat, which may further weigh on valuations in SoftBank's portfolio of unlisted companies.\n\nSince the beginning of April SoftBank holdings Klarna - a Swedish fintech firm - and Oyo - an Indian hotel chain - both delayed their listings following the announcement of tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever payments firm Paypay is currently preparing for an IPO, a subsidiary of SoftBank announced at its earnings results last week.",

    "title": "3 Things I'll Be Watching in Walmart's Upcoming Earnings Report (and 2 I'll Ignore)",
    "body": "The first metric is the growth of Walmart's retail media business. You know it better as \"advertising.\"\n\nRather, there are three other metrics I believe mean much more to long-term investors.\n\nNone of these numbers is a key concern of mine right now, however. They'll only be a snapshot of how the world's biggest retailer has been affected by unexpectedly sudden and steep import tariffs that should (hopefully) soon be under control. Indeed, as Walmart CFO John David Rainey conceded in April, \"[O]perating income has been harder to predict and we've widened our internal range of [profit] scenarios\" thanks to tariff uncertainty. If the company isn't quite sure where the bottom line is headed, neither investors nor analysts will want to count on any particular figure. Sales aren't etched in stone, either.\n\nFor the three-month stretch ending in April, analysts expect Walmart to report earnings of $0.58 per share on sales of $164.5 billion. That's a 2% improvement on the year-ago revenue figure of $161.5 billion, but rising costs will likely drag the bottom line down from a per-share comp of $0.60. U.S. same-store sales growth also likely slowed a bit from the fourth quarter's pace of 4.9%, reflecting the broader effect of lingering inflation and fresh economic uncertainty on consumer spending.\n\nRather, I'm watching three other pieces of information that will provide a much better picture of how the company's doing in this tricky environment. These three data nuggets are also better barometers of Walmart's longer-term health than the more-touted quarterly numbers are.\n\nI'm not as interested in the most-watched quarterly numbers this time around. I'm sure they'll be pretty good -- but not great -- and more or less in line with estimates.\n\nWe may be well into earnings season, but we haven't heard from every noteworthy name just yet. Mega-retailer Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is slated to report its fiscal first-quarter numbers on Thursday morning, offering a glimpse into consumers' current psyches and buying power.\n\nDon\u2019t read too much into the stock\u2019s initial response to the retailer\u2019s upcoming Q1 earnings report, no matter which direction it moves.\n\nWalmart\u2019s management recently said that tariffs and their ensuing uncertainty make it difficult to maintain profit margins or predict profitability.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf you've ever shopped at Walmart.com, you might have noticed advertisements on each page you navigate. These aren't just efforts from Walmart to induce a purchase. These ad placements are being paid for by the brands that Walmart sells. We won't hear a specific number -- just a percentage change, probably somewhere in the mid-20-percent range (plus a specific percentage-change figure for its U.S. online-shopping business). For perspective, Walmart did $3.4 billion worth of worldwide advertising business last year, up 28% year over year.\n\nThat's only a drop in the bucket compared to Walmart's total revenue. But for a company that only produced $27.1 billion in operating income and $15.5 billion in net income for the entirety of last year, this high-margin advertising business is actually a major contributor to the bottom line.\n\nThe second issue is last quarter's cost of goods sold and operating costs, like administrative expenses and selling payroll.\n\nMost of last fiscal quarter's sales came from goods that would have been purchased prior to any tariff-induced price increases. We could have seen some hint of these price hikes by April, though. Walmart's aiming to abate as much of this effect as it can. It remains to be seen how much it can, or even if it's starting to become a problem yet. The benchmark here is somewhere in the ballpark of the prior quarter's gross margin rate of 24%.\n\nAs for selling and administrative costs, Walmart's been adding automation to its supply chain for the past couple of years, with the ultimate goal of cutting its online-order-fulfillment costs by 30% by the end of this year. In-store payroll and administrative costs are likely to remain relatively static, so it'll be interesting to see how much net benefit this added efficiency will actually provide. The company's fourth-quarter operating expenses were a hair over 20% of sales, roughly in line with the full-year number.\n\nIt matters because retailers' profit margins are always under pressure, but particularly so right now against a backdrop of higher import tariffs. At the very least, we'll want to see spending growth not exceed revenue growth before any tariffs take full hold.\n\nFinally, I'll specifically want to know how well Walmart's e-commerce arm is growing.\n\nYou won't get a specific number here either -- just a comparison expressed as a percentage. For perspective, however, the prior quarter's online sales improved 16% overall, and 20% within the United States, where most of its online sales are made. That's a measurable slowdown from the third quarter's respective growth paces, as well as last year's first- and second-quarter online sales growth rate.\n\nAlthough the bulk of Walmart's business is still done in-store, the company's now doing over $100 billion worth of annual online business. That's about 15% of last year's total top line of $681 billion. E-commerce is the company's biggest growth engine right now, however, so if it's slowing down, it could take a sizable toll on Walmart's overall forward progress.\n\nThink bigger-picture\n\nThere's no assurance that other investors will be keying in on this data from Thursday's report. Indeed, it's likely they won't. The market will probably initially push Walmart stock higher or lower based on its well-watched revenue and earnings data, as it typically does.\n\nJust don't read too much into any such move. It's apt to only be a short-term response to numbers that are being temporarily skewed (and not necessarily for the worse) by tariff-prompted turbulence. RBC Capital Markets says Walmart is better equipped than its competitors to handle whatever tariff-related challenges await, thanks to its sheer scale and operational adaptability. That just means any trouble that might become apparent on Thursday is also apt to be unwound pretty quickly.\n\nAny initial post-earnings move from this stock should ultimately give way to the bigger-picture undertow illustrated by the aforementioned metrics. They paint a clearer picture of how the world's biggest retailer is actually navigating the current economic environment.\n\nIf you're looking to make a pre-earnings bet, I'd lean more toward owning Walmart stock than not. Most of any short-term tariff-related trouble is likely already priced in, setting the stage for the operational and cost-control resilience that RBC sees to be thrust into the spotlight. If that's the wrong call, it's still only apt to be a short-term setback.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walmart wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "body": "By Chen Aizhu\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Traders have rebranded more than $1 billion of Venezuelan oil shipments to China as Brazilian crude over the past year, according to two tanker tracking firms, company documents and four traders, helping buyers to cut logistics costs and circumvent U.S. sanctions.\n\nIndependent refiners in China are the main buyers of seaborne oil shipments from countries sanctioned by the United States, with offshore Malaysia serving as a key trans-shipment hub for Venezuelan and Iranian crude.\n\nSince July 2024, however, traders have also rebranded Venezuelan oil as from Brazil. This has enabled tankers to sail directly from Venezuela to China, skipping the stop-over in waters off Malaysia and shortening the voyage by about four days.\n\nWashington has imposed sanctions on Venezuelan energy exports since 2019 to reduce the oil export revenue that funds the government of President Nicolas Maduro, who has held power for more than a decade with elections that observers say were fraudulent.\n\nMaduro and his government have rejected sanctions by the United States and others, saying they are illegitimate measures that amount to \"economic war\" and are designed to cripple Venezuela.\n\nSince sanctions have been in place, oil traders have transferred oil from one ship to another at sea to disguise the origin of Venezuelan crude before it is shipped to China, which is the world's biggest crude importer.\n\nMore recently, shippers have tampered with the tankers' location signal to make it look like vessels are departing from Brazilian ports when they are actually sailing from Venezuela, according to maritime data, satellite imagery and shoreside photos compiled and analysed by monitoring service TankerTrackers.com. This practice is known as spoofing.\n\nAccording to Chinese customs data, China imported about 2.7 million metric tons, or 67,000 barrels per day (bpd), of mixed bitumen from Brazil between July 2024 and March 2025, worth $1.2 billion.\n\nChinese refiners regularly buy Brazilian crude but Brazil rarely exports any bitumen blend, according to state oil company Petrobras. Brazilian customs data records no export of bitumen blend to China since at least 2023.\n\nMixed bitumen, or bitumen blend, is a tar-like residue for processing into asphalt. However, Brazil's typical crude grades for export are classified as medium-sweet oil from its prolific offshore fields known as pre-salt.\n\n\"What we export to China is mainly crude oil from the pre-salt, it's not bitumen,\" Petrobras CEO Magda Chambriard told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Houston last week.",

China said its tariffs on U.S. goods will fall to 10% from 125%.\n\nThe agreement to allow time for more talks followed weekend negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, that the U.S. side said had made \u201c substantial progress.\u201d\n\nThe full impact on the complicated tariffs and other trade penalties enacted by Washington and Beijing remains unclear. And much depends on whether they will find ways to bridge longstanding differences during the 90-day suspension.\n\nBut as trade envoys from the world\u2019s two biggest economies blinked, finding ways to pull back from potentially massive disruptions to world trade and their own markets, investors rejoiced.\n\nThe future for the S&P 500 jumped 2.6% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2%.\n\nOil prices rallied, with U.S. benchmark crude oil gaining $1.66 to $62.68 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added $1.63 to $65.55 per barrel.\n\nThe U.S. dollar surged against the Japanese yen, trading at 148.18 Japanese yen, up from 146.17 yen. The euro fell to $1.1107 from $1.1209.\n\nIn other stock trading, Tokyo's market closed before the joint statement was issued, gaining less than 0.1% to 37,644.26. But Hong Kong's, which closes later, jumped 3% to 23,558.11.\n\nGermany's DAX gained 1% to 23,723.55 and the CAC 40 in Paris added 0.8% to 7,805.62. Britain's FTSE 100 edged 0.1% higher, to 8,560.42.\n\nInvestors were also watching for developments in other flashpoints including clashes between India and Pakistan, the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East.\n\nThe Sensex in Mumbai shot up 3.2% after India and Pakistan agreed to a truce after talks to defuse their most serious military confrontation in decades. The two armies have exchanged gunfire, artillery strikes, missiles and drones that killed dozens of people.\n\nPakistan's KSE 100 surged more than 9% and trading was halted for one hour following a spike driven by the ceasefire and an International Monetary Fund decision Friday to disburse about $1 billion of a bailout package for its battered economy.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index picked up 0.8% to 3,369.24.\n\nChinese EV battery maker CATL, or Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd., said in a prospectus filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that it plans to raise nearly $4 billion in a share listing.",

    "body": "Key Points\n\nAmerican Express is resistant to interest rate swings.\n\nRealty Income is broadly diversified across recession-resistant retailers.\n\nBoth stocks generate consistent growth and pay steady dividends.\n\n10 stocks we like better than American Express \u203a\n\nBlue chip dividend stocks are usually considered stable long-term investments, but they lost their luster over the past few years as interest rates spiked. Rising rates made risk-free CDs and Treasury bills more appealing, while making it tougher for many companies to support their dividends with consistent profits.\n\nBut as interest rates decline again, it might be smart to buy some of those blue chip dividend plays. So even if you only have $2,000 available to invest, you should consider buying and holding these two classic income stocks: American Express (NYSE: AXP) and Realty Income (NYSE: O).\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. American Express\n\nAmerican Express is often considered a credit card company, but it's also one of the U.S.'s largest banks. Unlike Visa and Mastercard, which only issue co-branded cards instead of issuing any cards of their own, American Express is both a card issuer and its own bank.\n\nIts total number of active cards rose 4% to 123.3 million in 2024. Therefore, it generates its revenue from both card processing fees and interest payments on its outstanding loans.\n\nAmerican Express controls a smaller slice of the global card-payments market than Visa and Mastercard, but that's an intentional business decision. Since it needs to back its own cards with its own balance sheet, it only issues them to lower-risk, higher-income individuals.\n\nThe company is also better insulated from interest rate swings than Visa and Mastercard. Rising rates might curb consumer spending and credit card purchases, but they'll still boost its banking segment's net interest income.\n\nThat balanced business model enabled American Express to grow its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) at compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of 10% and 12%, respectively, from 2019 to 2024. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to have CAGRs of 8% and 13%, respectively. Those are rock-solid increases for a stock trading at 18 times forward earnings.\n\nThe stock's forward dividend yield of 1.2% might seem low, but the company has raised its payout annually for 13 consecutive years. Its low payout ratio of 20% also gives it plenty of room for future dividend hikes.\n\nSo if you're looking for an evergreen financial stock that offers an attractive mix of growth and income, American Express checks all the right boxes.",

    "body": "By Leika Kihara and Makiko Yamazaki\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday signalled that increasing corn imports from the U.S. would be among options in trade negotiations with Washington, but warned Japan would never sacrifice its agriculture industry to win lower auto tariffs.\n\nJapan has made little headway in two rounds of trade talks with the U.S. as it seeks exemptions from U.S. tariffs, including a crippling 25% tariff on its mainstay automobiles.\n\nDuring the first round of talks last month, U.S. negotiators brought up automobiles and rice as areas where they said Tokyo puts up market barriers.\n\nAgreeing to buy more corn is a less controversial option for Japan than increasing rice imports, as Ishiba's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) relies heavily on rice farmers' support in elections.\n\nSpeaking in parliament, Ishiba repeated that Japan won't sacrifice the domestic agriculture industry for the sake of winning U.S. tariff concessions for automobiles.\n\n\"Still, Japan can use corn not for consumption but for use as ethanol fuel. Usage as biomass would be in Japan's national interest,\" Ishiba said, adding that Japanese soil was not necessarily suited for corn production anyway.\n\n\"We hope to deepen discussion on whether to use corn for consumption or energy,\" Ishiba said without elaborating.\n\nThe U.S. exported $2.8 billion worth of corn to Japan in 2024, to counter an 80% drop in exports to China.\n\nSpeaking at the same parliamentary session, Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said he won't waver in his demand for the U.S. to eliminate all the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.\n\nThe remarks came as Japan seeks to arrange a third round of bilateral ministerial-level trade talks later this month, which could be influenced by a deal reached between the U.S. and China to slash \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nJapan may also propose offering the U.S. technical cooperation in shipbuilding, two sources with knowledge of the negotiations said, confirming earlier reports by domestic media.\n\nJapanese policymakers and ruling party lawmakers have said they see no merit in striking a deal with the U.S. unless a 25% tariff on automobile imports are lifted, given the huge impact the industry has on Japan's export-heavy economy.\n\nThe impact is already evident in Japan's automobile sector. Mazda reported a 45.1% drop in net profits for the fiscal year that ended in March, and held off on disclosing earning estimates for the current year through March 2026.",

The 2025 gathering reportedly had 20,000 people in attendance, and many waited for hours for their chance to ask a question of the Oracle of Omaha.\n\nOne such member of the audience finally got his chance. He stepped up to the microphone and said, \"Out of all the companies that Berkshire Hathaway owns, there was one that you acquired, the Chicago-based company Portillo's (NASDAQ: PTLO) -- hot dogs -- how did you know that this would be a good fit for the overall company's portfolio?\"\n\nBuffett was gracious but visibly confused by the question. And that's because Berkshire Hathaway didn't acquire Portillo's and has never invested in the stock -- it's not among the things that Berkshire Hathaway owns.\n\nThis appears to be a case of mistaken identity. In 2014, private equity firm Berkshire Partners -- not affiliated with Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway -- invested in Portillo's when it was still a privately held business.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAs of Dec. 29, Berkshire Partners was still the largest shareholder in Portillo's with a nearly 19% stake. But before the company's initial public offering (IPO) Berkshire Partners owned more than 60% of the outstanding shares, meaning its stake has decreased significantly. And, again, Berkshire Partners isn't Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThat said, something strange happened immediately after the annual meeting for Berkshire Hathaway. Portillo's stock climbed about 10% over the next few trading sessions. Maybe it was just a coincidence. Or maybe, just maybe, people at Berkshire Hathaway's meeting decided to look into Portillo's and liked what they saw.\n\nI'm only speculating, but I don't think this is as far-fetched as it sounds. In fact, I believe Portillo's stock offers at least one thing that Warren Buffett would appreciate: This restaurant stock is an incredible value stock right now.\n\nWhy Portillo's stock is a good value\n\n\"I think all good investing is value investing.\" -- longtime Buffett colleague Charlie Munger.\n\nIf investors can find a profitable business with years of growth opportunity that trades at a bargain price, they may have just found a winner. And that's what I believe Portillo's stock can be for investors over the next 10 years.",

    "body": "Nvidia just received its first Wall Street sell rating -- and after May 28, which is the date Nvidia will unveil its fiscal 2026 first-quarter operating results, I fully expect more analysts to follow suit.\n\nGiven Nvidia's supercharged growth rate and the fact that no other direct competitor has come remotely close to matching its combination of compute speed and energy efficiency, it's no surprise that Wall Street analysts have rallied around the stock market's AI darling. In late January, I noted that the dozens of Wall Street analysts covering Nvidia all had respective price targets that was higher than where shares then traded.\n\nIn just two fiscal years (Nvidia's fiscal year ends in late January), Nvidia's net sales skyrocketed from $27 billion to $130.5 billion. For context, Wall Street's consensus calls for nearly $201 billion in full-year sales for fiscal 2026 (this year) and $248 billion in fiscal 2027.\n\nAlmost overnight, Nvidia's Hopper (H100) graphics processing unit (GPU) became the preferred \"brains\" powering enterprise AI-accelerated data centers. This has been followed up by the next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture, which can further expedite compute needs and is more energy efficient than its predecessor.\n\nWhile an estimated $15.7 trillion addressable market leaves room for dozens, if not hundreds, of winners, no company has been a more direct beneficiary of the rise of AI than semiconductor colossus Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nIn its simplest form, AI empowers software and systems with the capacity to reason and act on their own, as well as affords the potential to learn new skillsets without the need for human oversight. It's a game-changing technology with broad global application that the analysts at PwC believe can increase worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) $15.7 trillion by 2030.\n\nAlthough President Donald Trump's tariff policy has dominated the discussion on Wall Street over the last six weeks, it's the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) that's captivated investors for well over two years.\n\nIt's only a matter of time before other Wall Street analysts take note that Nvidia's biggest competitive advantage is waning,\n\nOne Wall Street analyst has bucked popular sentiment by placing a sell rating and $100 price target on the kingpin of the AI revolution.\n\nNo company has benefited more directly from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) than Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne Wall Street analyst is bucking popular sentiment\n\nIn late April, Seaport Research Partners' senior analyst Jay Goldberg initiated coverage on Nvidia with a $100 price target (a Wall Street low) and a sell rating.\n\nThough Goldberg acknowledged that Nvidia has done a lot right and its Blackwell GPU is highly sought-after, he believed the bull case was fully priced in, with numerous downside catalysts waiting in the wings.\n\nFor one, Goldberg believes it'll be difficult for Nvidia to surpass Wall Street's lofty consensus expectations given that it's maxed out its order capacity for Blackwell in fiscal 2026. Even though world-leading chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is rapidly expanding its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity -- CoWoS is essential for the packaging of high-bandwidth memory needed in AI-accelerated data centers -- it's still holding Nvidia back from selling even more of its next-gen hardware.\n\nGoldberg also anticipates that businesses will take a hard look at their spending later this year and into calendar year 2026. While Seaport's senior analyst doesn't expect an AI bubble to form and burst, he does believe that businesses are still in the process of feeling out real-world use cases for artificial intelligence. Goldberg suggests this will result in slower AI spending/orders in the quarters to come.\n\nAdditionally, and not surprisingly, Goldberg alluded to export restrictions to China as a front-and-center headwind. As a reminder, the Joe Biden Administration (since October 2022) and Trump administration placed stringent export restrictions on many high-powered AI chips and related equipment to China. The world's No. 2 economy by GDP generates billions of dollars in quarterly sales for Nvidia, which could notably shrink if tariff-related uncertainty persists and trade relations between the U.S. and China sour.\n\nBut I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg, and other Wall Street analysts will follow in Goldberg's footsteps once Nvidia's lifts the proverbial hood after the closing bell on May 28.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMore sell ratings are likely for Wall Street's AI darling\n\nSimilar to Goldberg, I'm happy to give Nvidia credit where credit is due. The company's Hopper and Blackwell chips will likely maintain their compute advantages and remain sought-after hardware for AI data centers. But Nvidia's nearly $2.9 trillion valuation suggests it has big shoes to fill -- and there are more headwinds upcoming than Seaport's senior analyst has listed.\n\nArguably the top challenge for Nvidia is the internal competition it's contending with. While most investors and analysts focus on direct competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Huawei, they're completely missing that many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing AI chips and solutions to use in their data centers.\n\nDespite most of these companies noting that this internally developed hardware will work side-by-side with Nvidia's GPUs, it doesn't change the fact that this will lead to cheaper and more readily available AI solutions that aren't backlogged. It's a plain-as-day recipe for Nvidia to miss out on future data center market share.\n\nEqually important, Nvidia is losing its biggest competitive advantage; and no, I'm not talking about the compute speed of Hopper or Blackwell. Rather, I'm alluding to the benefits it's reaped from AI-GPU scarcity.\n\nThough Nvidia can't meet the overwhelming demand for its Blackwell GPU architecture, it's not stopping AMD from bringing less-costly next-generation chips to market. It's also not slowing the aforementioned internal innovation of Nvidia's top clients. As this hardware enters high-compute data centers, it reduces the AI-GPU scarcity and immense pricing power that fueled Nvidia's gross margin.\n\nOne year ago, in fiscal 2025, Nvidia reported a scorching-hot generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) gross margin of 78.4%. Since then, its GAAP gross margin has declined every quarter, and is expected to have fallen to an estimated 70.6% (+/- 50 basis points) for the fiscal first quarter, which it'll report on May 28. We're witnessing Nvidia's leading advantage wane before our eyes.\n\nLastly, history would strongly suggest that artificial intelligence won't escape a bubble-bursting event. Every next-big-thing technology or innovation for more than 30 years has endured a bubble early in its expansion phase. With an overwhelming majority of businesses not optimizing their AI solutions, or even generating a positive return on their AI investments, it once again appears that investors have overestimated the early innings utility of a game-changing technology.\n\nWhen more Wall Street analysts begin paying attention to these factors, I predict the number of sell ratings for Nvidia stock will climb.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

    "body": "But Palantir's fortunes changed with the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and the launch two years ago of its AI-powered product, simply called its Artificial Intelligence Platform, or AIP. This system uses AI throughout the process of aggregating a customer's disparate data and helping that customer put it to work -- the results are often striking, changing the game for that particular user. AIP is helping customers save time and money, make better decisions, and develop new strategies and systems.\n\nPalantir has been around for more than 20 years, and in its earlier days it mainly was known for serving the government with its data gathering and analyses platforms. The company, over this time period, built out its capabilities, then launched an initial public offering five years ago. Though the stock initially took off, it slumped and wallowed in the doldrums a few years later.\n\nThis red-hot player is Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), and its recent news shows us why investors are so excited about the stock. Yet again, Palantir reported quarterly double-digit revenue growth, solid profitability, and boosted guidance for the full year. But before we get to that, let's look at Palantir's path so far -- and how it rushed from investors' radar screens into their portfolios.\n\nYet, against this backdrop of uncertainty, one tech company in particular stands out. This software player has seen its shares soar 1,400% over the past three years, resulting in a valuation that many analysts have said isn't sustainable. For months, they've predicted the stock was set to pull back. But so far any declines haven't lasted. In fact, this supercharged growth stock has climbed 55% so far this year. Let's meet the monster stock that continues to crush the market.\n\nMany of today's tech stocks -- including the Magnificent Seven that led last year's stock market gains -- have suffered in recent times. Even the most established of tech players such as Nvidia or Apple , for example, have seen their shares stumble. Why? Investors have worried that President Donald Trump's import tariff plan would hurt growth -- higher prices could result in lower spending by U.S. consumers and companies.\n\nIts recent earnings report showed the company has what it takes to keep generating growth over the long term.\n\nThis stock has soared 1,400% over the past three years and has climbed in the double digits since the start of this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnd to spur growth of this new system, Palantir launched bootcamps to offer customers an opportunity to test AIP and see how it could work for them. This has proven to be a fantastic strategy, and thanks to this, the quality of AIP, and the fact that the AI boom is going strong, Palantir's commercial revenue took off. So now, Palantir continues to see growth from its government customers, and commercial revenue is contributing significantly too. All of this, unfolding quarter after quarter, has stirred up investor excitement and helped the stock to skyrocket.\n\nDeals worth at least $1 million\n\nIn the most recent quarter, the first quarter of its fiscal-year 2025, Palantir delivered a fresh dose of good news: The U.S. government and commercial businesses each reported a double-digit increase in revenue. Deal value also is climbing, with Palantir saying it closed 139 deals in the period that were worth at least $1 million. That's up from 104 deals of that value just two quarters ago.\n\nImportantly, Palantir is balancing this growth with profitability, and this is reflected in its Rule of 40 score of 83%. At 40%, a software company is viewed as having a good growth/profit balance, so clearly Palantir is excelling in this area. Finally, Palantir finished off the report by lifting its total revenue, U.S. commercial revenue, adjusted income from operations and adjusted free cash flow guidance levels for the full year.\n\nNow, let's consider stock price. This has been the sticking point for potential investors -- though Palantir's outlook is incredibly bright, the stock is trading at a very high valuation: 200x forward earnings estimates. And analysts continue to predict a decline is near. Wall Street's average price target calls for the stock to fall about 20% in the coming 12 months.\n\nWhat does this mean for you as an investor? If you're a value investor, you probably won't want to pick up Palantir shares right now as they're not the right fit for a value strategy.\n\nBut if you're a growth investor and you aim to hold your investment for a number of years, you still may benefit from a Palantir buy today -- even at today's price. Though the stock could indeed stumble and go through a period of stagnation, this supercharged growth company has what it takes to power its share price higher over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

Two people familiar with the language of an analysis conducted by the office of the White House counsel, David Warrington, and the attorney general, Pam Bondi, whose past work as a lobbyist included Qatar as a client, said they had determined it would fall within the law for Mr. Trump\u2019s library to receive the plane. The two people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that have yet to be publicly announced.\n\nThe plane that would be donated by Qatar is expected to be retrofitted by a military contractor called L3Harris, in Texas, and that work can begin once the government approves how the plane is being acquired, one of the senior officials said. Assuming the transfer of the plane goes forward, it is expected to be finished being equipped with military capabilities by the end of the year, the official added, allowing Mr. Trump to use it while in office.\n\nThe status of the expected contract with L3Harris was not immediately clear.\n\nA Defense Department official said on Sunday that the Air Force has not yet reached any agreement on a contract to refurbish the Qatari 747 to make the security upgrades and modifications necessary for an AF1, and the Air Force could not legally do so until it actually took ownership of the plane.\n\nAssuming that happens, the official said, it would still take an extended period of time to complete the contract and, more important, to make the actual modifications to match a full Air Force One upgrade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking years, not months,\u201d the Defense Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details about a future Air Force One.",

    "body": "Even some Republicans in the Senate who have been vocal about their opposition to cutting Medicaid benefits, including Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Josh Hawley of Missouri, have said they are open to adding some work requirements to the program. Mr. Trump, who has been adamant that he did not want to do anything that could be characterized as a Medicaid cut, has also endorsed the policy.\n\nBut the legislation also ratchets up paperwork requirements across the program, by allowing states to check the income and residency of beneficiaries more often, and by permitting them to terminate coverage for people who do not respond promptly. The use of such strategies had been curtailed under a regulation published during the Biden administration.\n\nAn analysis of the paperwork change published by the Congressional Budget Office last week suggested that it would cause 2.3 million people to lose Medicaid coverage, many poor older and disabled people who are also enrolled in Medicare but use Medicaid to cover co-payments they cannot afford. Because this population is at special risk, the budget office found, the policy would cause only 600,000 more Americans to lose any form of health insurance, but it would cause many more to have trouble paying for medical care.\n\nThe bill would also require Medicaid beneficiaries who earn more than the federal poverty limit \u2014 around $15,650 for a single person \u2014 to pay higher co-payments for doctor visits. Typically, Medicaid requires very limited cost sharing from its beneficiaries, given their low incomes. The legislation would require co-payments of $35 for many medical services.\n\nDemocrats in Congress immediately assailed the package as an attack on health coverage for vulnerable populations.",

    "title": "Pope\u2019s Family History Offers a Glimpse Into the American Creole Journey",
    "body": "\u201cIn the 1970s, when busing began in the schools, the teachers were tasked with categorizing the students in their classrooms,\u201d said Wendy Gaudin, 54, referring to the effort in some cities to desegregate public schools. Her Creole grandparents left New Orleans for California. As an adult, Ms. Gaudin returned and now teaches in New Orleans at Xavier University, the only Catholic school among the nation\u2019s historically Black colleges and universities. \u201cI was categorized as a Native American, and my sister Roslyn was categorized as Caucasian, and my sister Leslie was categorized as a Pacific Islander.\u201d\n\nProfessor Gaudin, who has written a book about identity in the Creole diaspora, described how this racial ambiguity could help Creoles when they confronted obstacles in a place that was not quite the promised land that they had hoped. When her grandparents found property in Los Angeles to build a home, they discovered that the neighborhood had a racial covenant excluding Black people. Her grandmother, who was \u201cvery, very fair skinned,\u201d she said, went to the bank, paid the deposit and signed the papers. Then her grandfather, who was darker-skinned, built a house and they moved in.\n\n\u201cAnd nothing could be said, because the land was already theirs,\u201d she said.\n\nThere were some who chose to live in their new hometowns as white people, or who simply lived that way because no one ever asked. This did not always involve explicitly creating a new identity; often, it involved simply moving away and keeping quiet.\n\nOne of those whose Louisiana Creole roots were unknown, at least to most around them, was George Herriman, who created the famed comic strip \u201cKrazy Kat,\u201d and who was assumed to be Greek by some of his associates. The Louisiana Creole heritage of Anatole Broyard, the influential New York writer and literary critic who wrote book reviews for The Times, was not publicly known until years after his death.\n\nIn 1946, Mr. Roudan\u00e9\u2019s grandmother filed to have the family surname officially changed \u2014 likely dropping the \u2018z\u2019 because it might tip the authorities off to his Creole heritage \u2014 and shortly after, her son was admitted to Tulane University, which at the time was all white. A few years after graduating, he moved to the Midwest and lived the rest of his life as a white man.",

She retired after working for 34 years at Verizon, which hired Caremark for her drug coverage.\n\nIn a letter to Verizon, she complained, \u201cThis is forcing patients to switch medications against their will, and without medical justification, to a less effective medication.\u201d\n\nVerizon did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWord spread quickly online about the change after Caremark announced it this month. Joseph Zucchi, a physician assistant at a weight-loss clinic in New Hampshire, set up a change.org petition urging the company to reverse course. Last year, Mr. Zucchi disclosed that he would be receiving compensation as a speaker for Lilly. As of Sunday afternoon, the petition had more than 2,700 signatures.\n\nCaremark intends to stop coverage for Zepbound in July.\n\nDoctors say that Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk, and Zepbound are both good drugs, but that they prefer Zepbound for most patients. Now they will have far less ability to tailor obesity drug prescriptions to individuals.",

    "title": "Opinion | Serbia Is Showing America What\u2019s Possible",
    "body": "It was an Easter miracle.\n\nProtesters had been blocking the building of Radio Television of Serbia, the national public broadcaster in Belgrade, with a simple demand: cover objectively the monthslong struggle against Serbia\u2019s increasingly autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. But after days there, they needed reinforcements. On Good Friday students from Novi Pazar, the largest city in the region where most of the country\u2019s Muslims live, arrived to take over the blockade. Since Muslim students were not celebrating Easter, they volunteered to relieve their colleagues from Belgrade.\n\nThis show of solidarity was magical enough. But then a war veteran, who had been wounded in 1992 during the siege of Sarajevo, addressed the crowd. After denouncing the broadcaster for siding with those in power, he greeted the students from Novi Pazar: \u201cSalaam aleikum\u201d echoed across the square. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your children,\u201d he told their parents. \u201cThere are no more \u2018ours\u2019 and \u2018yours.\u2019 They are all our children now.\u201d\n\nIt was a cathartic moment, a gesture of profound inclusion in a country scarred by wars and deep-seated divisions. But it was more than that. It marked a Copernican shift for Serbia, as the country is being transformed by a brave and enduring student-led movement. Combating an entrenched and powerful autocratic government, protesters are showing what \u2014 against all the odds \u2014 is possible. Here in the Balkans, something extraordinary is happening.\n\nSerbia has seen major protest movements before. In 1996, students launched mass demonstrations against the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, beginning his downfall, which finally came in 2000. In the 13 years of Mr. Vucic\u2019s rule, there have been several waves of protest \u2014 against shady development projects like Belgrade Waterfront, in defiance of widespread violence and, most recently, opposing lithium exploitation by the mining company Rio Tinto.",

From what we can tell so far, those on both the left and the right of the U.S. political divide are likely to be frustrated. Leo could well end up being the pope who makes it clear that the reason Catholic doctrine does not fit well into American politics is because it makes heavier demands than partisans on either side are willing to bear.\n\nEven though he is a Chicago native and a White Sox fan known to many of his friends as Bob, Cardinal Robert Prevost, now Pope Leo XIV, was considered \u201cthe least American of the Americans\u201d in the College of Cardinals, according to the Italian media. He has deep global experience, first in Peru as a missionary, teacher and bishop, then in Rome as the worldwide leader of his Augustinian order, and finally at the Vatican\u2019s office for bishops, a post that was crucial for overcoming any skepticism among the electors about a candidate born in the United States.",

As such, the campaign is being fought less over policies and more as a referendum on Mr. Yoon and his right-wing People Power Party.\n\nThe party has not cut ties with Mr. Yoon, who is facing trial on insurrection charges.

But the topic has surfaced repeatedly. When U.S. officials unveiled a trade deal with Britain on Thursday, for instance, beef was part of the agreement.\n\nBut according to Britain, the deal would simply make it cheaper for Americans to export more hormone-free beef to the country and would not weaken British health and safety rules, which are similar to those in the E.U.\n\nWhen it comes to the European Union, the United States can already export a large amount of hormone-free beef without facing tariffs, so an equivalent deal would do little to help American farmers.\n\nBut diplomats and European officials have repeatedly insisted that there is no wiggle room to lower those health and safety standards. And when it comes to meat-related trade restrictions more broadly, there is very little. Chicken, for instance, faces relatively high tariffs, and there is limited appetite to lower those rates.",

    "title": "Climate crisis threatens the banana, the world\u2019s most popular fruit, research shows",
    "body": "The climate crisis is threatening the future of the world\u2019s most popular fruit, as almost two-thirds of banana-growing areas in Latin America and the Caribbean may no longer be suitable for growing the fruit by 2080, new research has found.\n\nRising temperatures, extreme weather and climate-related pests are pummeling banana-growing countries such as Guatemala, Costa Rica and Colombia, reducing yields and devastating rural communities across the region, according to Christian Aid\u2019s new report, Going Bananas: How Climate Change Threatens the World\u2019s Favourite Fruit.\n\nBananas are the world\u2019s most consumed fruit \u2013 and the fourth most important food crop globally, after wheat, rice and maize. About 80% of bananas grown globally are for local consumption, and more than 400 million people rely on the fruit for 15% to 27% of their daily calories.\n\nAn estimated 80% of banana exports which supply supermarkets around the world come from Latin America and the Caribbean \u2013 one of the most vulnerable regions to extreme weather and slow-onset climate disasters.\n\nAnd yet the crop is under threat from the human-made climate crisis, and threatens a vital food source and the livelihoods of communities that have contributed virtually nothing to the greenhouse gases driving global heating.\n\n\u201cClimate change has been killing our crops. This means there is no income because we cannot sell anything. What is happening is that my plantation has been dying. So, what has been happening is death,\u201d Aurelia Pop Xo, 53, a banana grower in Guatemala, told Christian Aid researchers.\n\nBananas, especially the cavendish, are sensitive fruits. They require a temperature range between 15C and 35C (59F and 95F) to thrive, and just enough water \u2013 but not too much. They are sensitive to storms, which can cause a banana plant to shred leaves, making it much harder for the crop to photosynthesize.\n\nWhile there are hundreds of banana varieties, the cavendish accounts for the vast majority of exports since it was chosen by the fruit conglomerates for its decent flavor, hardiness and high yield. It\u2019s this lack of genetic variation that makes bananas particularly vulnerable to the rapidly changing climate.\n\nThe climate crisis directly harms growing conditions \u2013 and contributes to the spread of fungal diseases that are already decimating crops and livelihoods. Black leaf fungus can reduce the ability of banana plants to photosynthesize by 80% and it thrives in wet conditions, making bananas at risk from erratic rainfall and flooding. Rising temperatures and changing rain patterns are exacerbating another fungus, fusarium tropical race 4, a soil-borne microbe which is devastating entire cavendish plantations across the world.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

    "title": "This American pope: Leo XIV\u2019s bloodline reflects the US melting pot",
    "body": "Pope Leo XIV, who on Thursday was elected as the first-ever US-born leader of the Roman Catholic church, has a familial bloodline that reflects his homeland\u2019s fraught relationship with race \u2013 and why the nation\u2019s stature as a melting pot of origins has long endured, records unearthed by genealogists show.\n\nThe maternal grandfather of 69-year-old Robert Prevost, the newly minted pope, was evidently born abroad in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, according to birth records that professional genealogist Chris Smothers cited to ABC News in a recent report. When Leo\u2019s grandfather, Joseph Martinez, obtained an 1887 marriage license to wed the future pope\u2019s grandmother, Louise Baqui\u00e9, he listed his birthplace as Haiti, which at the time was the same territory as Santo Domingo, Smothers noted.\n\nBaqui\u00e9\u2019s birth records, meanwhile, indicate that she was born in Louisiana\u2019s most prominent city, New Orleans, to parents who were reportedly married at a local Catholic church.\n\nRecords from the 1900 census show that Joseph \u2013 apparently the son of a Louisianan \u2013 and Louise lived at a home in New Orleans\u2019s Seventh Ward, a bastion for the city\u2019s Creole people. The couple\u2019s home later was among hundreds that were demolished to make way for a highway overpass linking New Orleans\u2019s suburbs to its globally renowned French Quarter, a move that drastically reduced the area\u2019s population and economically devastated the scores of Black businesses that had been prevalent there.\n\nThose same census records identified Leo\u2019s maternal grandparents as Black. Two of his aunts were similarly identified, just about four years after the Plessy v Ferguson US supreme court case \u2013 which originated in New Orleans \u2013 upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation in the country.\n\nBy 1920, the Martinez family had moved north to Chicago and away from the racially oppressive US south. The future pope\u2019s mother, the Chicago-born Mildred Agnes Martinez, was eight at the time. And the census that decade listed the Martinezes as white.\n\nIt would not be until 1954 that the US supreme court would issue the ruling that overturned the Plessy v Ferguson precedent and deemed racial segregation unconstitutional \u2013 and even then, many communities across the nation spent years flouting the decision. Multiple genealogists theorized that the Martinezes may have strategically shifted their racial identity to assimilate in Chicago, which \u2013 though further north \u2013 has had its own history of discrimination and oppression on the basis of skin color.\n\n\u201cYou can understand [that] people may have intentionally sought to obfuscate their heritage,\u201d Jari Honora, a family historian for the Historic New Orleans Collection, told the Associated Press. Honora added that \u201calways life has been precarious for people of color\u201d.\n\nMildred Martinez eventually married Louis Marius Prevost. The librarian and her husband \u2013 a second world war veteran and educator \u2013 raised three sons in Chicago. The youngest, Robert, was ordained a priest in 1982; became the worldwide leader of the Catholic religious order colloquially known as the Augustinians; led a Peruvian diocese; was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in September 2023; and headed the Vatican entity in charge of selecting new bishops around the world.\n\nThe US registered a record-setting 47.8 million immigrants in 2023, three-quarters of whom were naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents or visa holders \u2013 all of whom buttressed the country\u2019s centuries-old, metaphorical reputation as a melting pot.\n\nThat status has come under threat when Donald Trump clinched a second US presidency the following year \u2013 and his administration mounted an immigration crackdown marked by steady news of detentions and deportations after he returned to the Oval Office in January.\n\nLeo\u2019s fellow cardinals elected him to succeed the late Francis after a two-day conclave that concluded less than four months into Trump\u2019s second presidency. And one of Leo\u2019s older brothers, suburban Chicago resident and retired Catholic school principal John Prevost, quickly told the New York Times: \u201cI know he\u2019s not happy with what\u2019s going on with immigration.\u201d\n\nSocial media users just as rapidly flocked to an account seemingly belonging to Leo and noted how it had demonstrated a willingness to be critical of the administration\u2019s positions. One of the account\u2019s entries reposted an article about Catholic bishops in California who attributed \u201cracism and nativism\u201d to Trump\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cbad hombres\u201d for certain Mexicans.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how much Leo might be a foil to the chief executive of the global superpower from which he hails, among other issues confronting the pope. And there is no indication Leo has ever publicly discussed his racial identity much.\n\nJohn Prevost, for his part, told the Times that his brothers did not discuss their Louisiana roots. He also said his immediate family did not identify as Black.\n\nA Vatican news release said Leo\u2019s father was of French and Italian descent. It said the pope\u2019s mother was of Spanish ancestry.\n\nWhatever the case, Loyola Marymount University professor Kim R Harris, who teaches African American religious thought and practice, remarked to the AP that she hopes Leo\u2019s papacy \u201cbrings to light who we are as Americans and who we are as a people of the diaspora\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about a person who brings so much of the history of this country in his bones,\u201d Harris said, \u201cit brings a whole new perspective and widens the vision of who we all are.\u201d",

    "body": "Ministers are weighing up proposals for a Chinese company to supply wind turbines for a major offshore windfarm in the North Sea.\n\nThe government is in discussions with Green Volt North Sea over whether Mingyang, China\u2019s biggest offshore wind company, should supply the wind turbines. Mingyang has emerged as the preferred manufacturer, but the company has sought advice from ministers on whether to proceed.\n\nGreen Volt, which is jointly owned by Flotation Energy, a Scottish company and V\u00e5rgr\u00f8nn, a Norwegian one, is constructing the first commercial-scale floating offshore windfarm in Europe. The project will deliver electricity to oil and gas platforms, replacing power currently generated by gas and diesel turbines, and provide electricity to the UK grid.\n\nThe decision over whether to source its wind turbines from Mingyang will be closely scrutinised after the government stepped in to take control of British Steel amid claims that its Chinese owner, Jingye Group, wanted to shut down its Scunthorpe plant to make the UK a dumping ground for Chinese steel.\n\nThe incident triggered calls for Chinese companies to be locked out of involvement with critical national infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said at first that he would not bring another Chinese company into the British steel sector before softening his position.\n\nEd Miliband, the energy secretary, travelled to China earlier this spring to discuss closer cooperation on energy and climate.\n\nThe decision over whether Mingyang can supply the turbines is not subject to any formal government process, but the company is unlikely to proceed if ministers say they have security concerns.\n\nThe Sun reported three months ago that some officials in the Ministry of Defence and Department for Energy Security and Net Zero had raised concerns about the proposed deal. Green Volt has been waiting for a verdict from the government for weeks, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nAn industry source said the UK did not currently have the heavy manufacturing capability to produce the turbines domestically. \u201cThey have tried to get European manufacturers to no avail,\u201d the source said of Green Volt. \u201cMiliband is on to something here. We all want to get to where he wants to get to, but if it\u2019s not from Chinese companies, who is going to [supply wind turbines] to us?\u201d\n\nThe project would be an important contributor to the government\u2019s mission to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Progress towards that suffered a blow this week when the Danish company \u00d8rsted cancelled its plans to build one of the UK\u2019s largest offshore windfarms, the Hornsea 4 project. Ministers are hopeful that \u00d8rsted will return to the table, however.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Guardian contacted Mingyang for comment.\n\nA Green Volt spokesperson said: \u201cWe are developing the largest commercial-scale, floating offshore windfarm in the world, working to hugely ambitious timelines to deliver the government\u2019s goal of 43-50 GW of offshore wind by 2030. Having secured a contract for difference from the government last year, we are identifying supply chain partners to help us build the windfarm. As yet, no turbine supplier has been confirmed for Green Volt.

    "body": "Millions of Filipinos began voting on Monday in a midterm election widely seen as a referendum on the explosive feud between President Ferdinand Marcos and impeached vice-president Sara Duterte.\n\nWorkers in the capital, Manila, were busily setting up polling stations on Sunday for a race that will decide more than 18,000 posts, from seats in the House of Representatives to hotly contested municipal offices.\n\nIt is the Senate race, however, that carries potentially major implications for 2028\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe 12 senators elected on Monday will form half the jury in a Duterte impeachment trial \u2013 tentatively set for July \u2013 that could see her permanently barred from public office. In a speech at a rally last week, Duterte said her name, and her family\u2019s name \u201chave been dragged through the mud\u201d. \u201cWho will really benefit if the Duterte family is gone from this world? Not the Filipinos, not the victims of crime, the unemployed, the poor or even the hungry.\u201d\n\nDuterte\u2019s long-simmering feud with former ally Marcos exploded in February when she was impeached by the House for alleged \u201chigh crimes\u201d including corruption and an assassination plot against the president. She has denied the allegations, adding that she had presented the assassination plot as a hypothetical scenario.\n\nBarely a month later, her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, was arrested and flown to the international criminal court (ICC) the same day to face a charge of crimes against humanity over his deadly anti-drugs campaign.\n\nView image in fullscreen Philippine vice-president Sara Duterte Photograph: Basilio Sepe/AP\n\nSara Duterte will need nine votes in the 24-seat Senate to preserve any hope of a future presidential run.\n\nHeading into Monday, seven of the candidates polling in the top 12 were endorsed by Marcos while four were aligned with his vice-president.\n\nTwo, including the president\u2019s independent-minded sister Imee Marcos, were \u201cadopted\u201d as honorary members of the Duterte family\u2019s PDP-Laban party on Saturday.\n\nThe move to add Imee Marcos and television personality Camille Villar to the party\u2019s slate was intended to add \u201cmore allies to protect the vice-president against impeachment\u201d, according to the resolution.\n\nAt her final rally in Manila on Thursday, Duterte invoked the spectre of \u201cmassive\u201d electoral fraud and once again referred to her father\u2019s transfer to the ICC as a \u201ckidnapping\u201d.\n\nDespite his detention at The Hague, the elder Duterte remains on the ballot in his family\u2019s southern stronghold of Davao city, where he is seeking to retake his former job as mayor.\n\nAt least one local poll is predicting he will win comfortably.\n\nNational police in the archipelago nation have been on alert for more than a week, and about 163,000 officers have been deployed to secure polling stations, escort election officials and guard checkpoints.\n\nThousands more personnel from the military, fire departments and other agencies have been mobilised to keep the peace in a country where battles over hotly contested provincial posts are known to erupt in violence.\n\nA city council hopeful, a polling officer and a village chief are among the at least 16 people police say have been killed in attacks in the run-up to Monday\u2019s election.\n\nOn Saturday, a candidate for municipal councillor was one of two men in an \u201carmed group\u201d killed in a shootout with police and the military in southern Mindanao island\u2019s autonomous Muslim region, a notorious hotbed of election-related violence.\n\nFarther north, a group of men were arrested the same day at the Cebu airport while transporting 441m pesos (nearly $8m) in cash, a crime under election rules aimed at preventing the exchange of bribes for votes.\n\nBoth cases were still under investigation.",

    "body": "Queensland Labor has voted to expel one of its members from caucus in a move labelled \u201cunprecedented\u201d by the state party\u2019s leader, Steven Miles.\n\nThe member for Stafford, Jimmy Sullivan, was subsequently ejected from the Labor party entirely on Monday night, after a meeting of its administrative committee.\n\nThe vote to remove Sullivan from Labor\u2019s caucus came after allegations of involvement in a \u201cdomestic and family violence incident\u201d were raised by the Liberal National party in parliament.\n\nThe MP responded to his expulsion in a defiant statement on Monday night, labelling it a \u201ccheap political move\u201d.\n\nLabor MPs voted to kick Sullivan out in an extraordinary caucus meeting on Monday, with all MPs but Sullivan himself backing the motion put forth by Miles. The opposition leader subsequently claimed the MP had failed to comply with a \u201csafe return-to-work plan\u201d after taking extended leave from parliament.\n\nCaucus also voted to refer Sullivan to the party\u2019s administrative committee for potential dismissal from Labor. On Monday night, the committee decided to expel him from the Labor party.\n\nAllegations have swirled around Sullivan since media reports last year that police were called to his home on 27 October. No charges were laid.\n\nIt was the day after Sullivan was re-elected as the member for Stafford.\n\nAmanda Camm, the Liberal National party government\u2019s minister for the prevention of domestic violence, told parliament on 30 April that Sullivan \u201cwas involved in an alleged domestic violence incident\u201d and described him as \u201can alleged perpetrator of domestic and family violence\u201d.\n\nLabor says that legal matters involving Sullivan were dismissed by a magistrate in their entirety. The MP took four months\u2019 leave from late October and returned to work in February.\n\nThe motion to dismiss Sullivan was moved by Miles and seconded by his deputy, Cameron Dick on Monday.\n\nAt a brief press conference at parliament, Miles said Sullivan had been set a \u201csafe return-to-work plan\u201d for the MP.\n\nIt included \u201cwhat you would expect to see in a return-to-work plan for somebody who had to take extended leave for personal and health matters\u201d, Miles said.\n\nThat included keeping the party and the parliamentary leadership informed about his health status at regular intervals.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t complied with that plan and as a result, we have sought caucus support to take this action,\u201d Miles said.\n\nMiles said Sullivan had not provided any updates \u201cfor some time\u201d. He said \u201cparty elders\u201d and others in Labor had tried to convince him to \u201ctake an appropriate course of action\u201d.\n\nHe said Sullivan could now choose to remain an MP on the crossbench or resign.\n\n\u201cThe Labor party does and always has set a very high standard for our members of parliament,\u201d he said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "body": "35m ago 09.32 CEST Supermarket shares fall after Woolworths announces price cuts on almost 400 products Catie McLeod Share prices of the major supermarkets fell today after Woolworths announced price cuts on almost 400 products. Woolworths shares fell by 49 cents or 1.47% on Monday to $32.77, while shares in rival Coles dropped by 21 cents or 0.93% to $22.27. Shareholders appear to be reacting to a cut in profit margins if Coles reacts to Woolworths\u2019 announcement and competition intensifies. The Woolworths chief executive officer, Amanda Bardwell, wrote to customers on Monday to say many popular products, including from the supermarket\u2019s own-brand range, would have their prices reduced until at least 2026. In the note, seen by Guardian Australia, Bardwell said: Individually, each lower shelf price might not seem like a dramatic difference, but they will add up to real savings. Families spending $150 on their weekly shop could now save on average about $15 a week when buying Lower Shelf Price products. The major supermarkets have been under pressure to help customers with cost-of-living pressures, after the release of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\u2019s report from its year-long inquiry into the sector. The competition regulator found the major chains increased their profit margins during a period marked by rapidly rising household costs. Share Updated at 09.41 CEST\n\n42m ago 09.26 CEST Higher education bodies welcome reappointments of Jason Clare and Andrew Giles Higher education bodies have also released statements welcoming the reappointments of Jason Clare as education minister and Andrew Giles as minister for skills and training. Universities Australia CEO, Luke Sheehy, said reappointments provided the sector with \u201ccontinuity, which is so important during this era of reform\u201d. He also backed the creation of an international education minister. Moving forward, our sector needs certainty and stability in international education, and I look forward to continuing to work constructively with home affairs minister Tony Burke to find a workable path forward. Minister Burke will be ably supported by the new assistant minister for international education, Julian Hill MP, and I welcome the creation of this role given the sector\u2019s importance to the Australian economy and our relationships with the outside world. The Group of Eight (Go8) chief executive, Vicki Thomson, said Labor was re-elected with a clear majority and was in a strong position to introduce reforms to lift investment in research and development (R&D) which is \u201cessential to secure Australia\u2019s future prosperity\u201d. We also urge the government to scrap the flawed Job Ready Graduates scheme as a matter of urgency, to create a more equitable environment for our students, so we can educate the highly skilled graduates we need to remain competitive.

In a statement on Monday afternoon, Ryan said she thanked Hamer for the call and wished her best for the future. The contest in Kooyong came down to the wire with Ryan leading by about 1,100 votes as of Monday afternoon, despite increasing her primary vote by about 3% since the 2022 election. Ryan said she was \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d to family, friends, and her team for the campaign win. She continued: It\u2019s a crucial time for Australia \u2013 we\u2019re facing a cost-of-living crisis, housing shortages, increasing intergenerational inequity, and our response to the global challenge of climate change has been too slow and too incremental. With the Albanese government holding an increased majority, it\u2019s time for it to show the courage we need \u2013 and respect the mandate given to it by the Australian public \u2013 by taking real action on these issues. I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to continue to hold the government to account on the economy, climate, health, and the other critical issues for my community. Share Updated at 09.23 CEST\n\n1h ago 08.53 CEST Peak body for development and humanitarian NGOs congratulates Anne Aly on cabinet role The Australian Council for International Development (ACFID), the peak body for Australian development and humanitarian NGOs, congratulated Anne Aly for her role of minister for international development, and thanked the former minister Pat Conroy for his dedication to strengthening partnerships with the sector. Its CEO, Matthew Maury, also welcomed the appointment of a special envoy for climate change adaptation and resilience, which he said highlighted Labor\u2019s commitment to an ambitious Cop31, should the bid be successful. The Albanese government in its first term delivered solid progress in strengthening Australia\u2019s aid program. From Development Partnership Plans to incremental increases to the overall aid program, the sector has appreciated that Australia has held the line on aid as other donors have retreated. In the Albanese Government\u2019s second term, ACFID is calling for a pathway to increase Australia\u2019s aid budget from 0.65% to 1% of the Federal Budget. It\u2019s a modest increase but will make a world of difference.

The Smart Energy Council warmly welcomed the return of Chris Bowen as minister for energy climate change, as well as Murray Watt to the environment and water ministry. Its chief executive, John Grimes, said Bowen had \u201cachieved much in the last three years\u201d and retaining him would be \u201cof great comfort to the renewable energy industry\u201d. Australia has made great progress decarbonising its energy and transport sectors, yet there is so much more to do, that includes a greater focus on climate and the environment. The Australian Academy of Science similarly welcomed the new Albanese ministry. Its president, Prof Chennupati Jagadish AC, urged new ministers Tim Ayres and Dr Andrew Charlton to back increased research and development (R&D) spending in their portfolios to boost productivity.

I am happy. It was a vote for certainty and continuity and a recognition that the Nationals in this last campaign, although we were part of a disappointing result for the Coalition \u2026 performed quite well. Asked if it concerned him that a group within his party would have preferred Matt Canavan, Chester said it was the \u201cright time\u201d for people to put up their hand for a leadership role. Matt and David spoke well. We were spoiled for choice \u2026 we will [now] look at our election performance and look at the policies we think are worth continuing with and the ones that haven\u2019t stood the test of the election of the Australian people. We have work to do. We lost the election badly. We have to look at our policies, work out what is the best way to take Australia forward. I live in an electorate which has had 100 years of energy production. There are people in that community who understand you need reliability, affordability and you need to be part of the global challenge to reduce emissions \u2026 I don\u2019t think we are beaten. It is not beyond hope. We need to look carefully at our policies and take a credible position forward to the Australian people in three years\u2019 time. Share Updated at 08.31 CEST\n\n2h ago 08.06 CEST Littleproud \u2018disappointed\u2019 at Jacinta Price\u2019s departure but says Nationals will \u2018be the adults in the room\u2019 On his own leadership, which was challenged by Canavan, Littleproud says it\u2019s a \u201cgreat thing\u201d to have a culture of spilling all positions regardless of win, lose or draw. What I want to leave is a legacy, a legacy for the people I represent. And no matter how long I\u2019m in that chair, I\u2019m going to use every day to make sure I leave that legacy \u2026 That\u2019s what gets me up in the morning. That\u2019s what gets me into this place. But no matter how long I\u2019m here, I want to be able to look back and say, I\u2019ve left a legacy. As for Jacinta Price\u2019s legacy, which is up in the air this week following her defection to the Liberals to run as deputy leader to Angus Taylor, Littleproud says he hasn\u2019t had further conversations with the Senator since she made her decision. She rang me about an hour before she put the statement out. The reality is, Jacinta has greater ambitions than what the National party room can offer. We\u2019ve been very supportive of her when no one else would \u2026 so I wish her well. Asked if he is \u201cboiling with resentment\u201d Littleproud says he isn\u2019t, but \u201cwe are disappointed\u201d. We\u2019re going to be the adults in the room, because that\u2019s what the National party\u2019s been for the last three years. We\u2019re going to get on with the job of not worrying about ourselves or worrying about you. That\u2019s what this country wants. Share Updated at 08.11 CEST\n\n2h ago 08.01 CEST Littleproud stays quiet on potential discussions of Coalition agreement Littleproud is again pressed on how he would respond to the Liberals dumping their nuclear power policy, and whether net zero could be achieved without it. He says you \u201ccannot run an economy of the industrial scale, the size of Australia on an renewables approach\u201d, adding we will see \u201cenergy bills going up\u201d and \u201ccost of living go up\u201d under Labor. On whether he\u2019d like to see the scales \u201ctip more towards the Nationals\u201d in the Coalition agreement, he says he\u2019s \u201cjust a bloke from western Queensland\u201d. But I\u2019ve done a few deals out there \u2026 I don\u2019t intend to telecast the discussions I intend to have with the new Liberal party leadership, whatever that may be tomorrow. He also has a little dig at Andrew Gee, who left the Nationals to become an independent due to his support for the voice, and retained his seat this election. He was elected last Saturday on 23% of the primary vote, hardly an overwhelming result when he relied on the support of a teal from a Melbourne billionaire bankrolling them from Melbourne, from the Labor party and the Greens. Share Updated at 08.09 CEST\n\n2h ago 07.55 CEST Littleproud \u2018not getting into hypotheticals\u2019 over question of support for net zero On to questions. David Littleproud is asked what got him over the line against Matt Canavan, and whether the Nationals arrived on a position on net zero during today\u2019s meeting. He replies that today was about the leadership of the party, not a policy meeting, while adding \u201cwe\u2019ll have discussions\u201d. We\u2019re going to review all our policies and we\u2019ll do that in a calm, methodical way, similar to the way that we worked through the voice \u2026 we\u2019ll be principled about the people that we represent and making sure we understand the implications of that. So we\u2019re not rushing into anything, but we will work through that in a collegial way \u2026 The reality is the leader of the National party doesn\u2019t determine the policy direction of our party.

I think it\u2019s important to respect the process. That\u2019s what it is to lead the National party, to respect those that are in that room and the diversity of views in there, and to work to a position that is in the nation\u2019s interests and in regional Australia\u2019s interest.

I lead a united, highly intellectual group of fighters on behalf of the 9 million Australians who don\u2019t live in capital cities in this country. The Coalition was handed a significant defeat, and we need to listen to the Australian people with humility, understanding that these were collective decisions of both the Liberal and the National party. We need to respect their decision and we need to have a deep, honest look at what went wrong. I know that will take a period of time, and I look forward to participating fully in those discussions. But as David and Kevin have said, the National party provides stability and strength to the Coalition over a long period of time.

We are in a very important political body, and we\u2019ll continue to be so \u2026 we are cognisant of and very conscious that we have to do a lot more work as Nats. But we have not lost a federal parliamentary seat since 2007. We\u2019ve got Capricornia, Flynn, Dawson, Page, my seat, which were all held by the Labor Party in 2007. New England and Lyne were held by independents in 2007. Now we over the period \u2026 won those seats back and held them through very trying times. So it\u2019s a statistic. We\u2019re not lazy, we\u2019re not complacent, but it\u2019s a statistic \u2026 we will continue to always put regional Australians before everyone else. Thank you. Share Updated at 08.03 CEST\n\n2h ago 07.48 CEST Littleproud \u2018proud of the Nationals\u2019 for policy achievements Littleproud also credits the National party with pushing for divestiture powers of supermarket monopolies. These are core principles that I\u2019m proud to have led a team. These aren\u2019t my achievements. We are a collective, not an individual has achieved any of this. But we as a collective. And I\u2019m proud to say that our party room now will consider further policy moves as we go to the next phase. But today was the important first step after an election loss. We\u2019ve got to acknowledge we lost any opportunity to form government and we acknowledge that. But I\u2019m proud of the Nationals and our result. Littleproud notes Perin Davey lost her Senate bid, which he says wasn\u2019t a reflection of her or the NSW Nationals. That\u2019s a reflection of a drop in the Liberal vote that she\u2019s part of a joint ticket in. But \u2026 we\u2019ve had a 10% swing, all because of the localised way in which we\u2019ve run a campaign. Now there\u2019s lessons to be learned, but I\u2019m proud of the Nationals and what we\u2019ve been able to achieve because we\u2019ve done it as a team and there\u2019ll be some big questions that we\u2019ll have to move forward on, but we\u2019ll do that in a calm, methodical way.

He says it\u2019s a \u201cgreat honour\u201d to continue to lead the party, and credits the Nationals with turning Australia against the voice ahead of the referendum, as well as encouraging the Coalition to adopt a nuclear energy policy. I\u2019m proud of our achievements over the last three years, the last three years where I think we set the policy agenda. We were the first ones to make a principled position on the voice. We didn\u2019t do that in a rushed way. We listened to both sides. We got to a policy position and made sure that we set the tone \u2026 for the conversation that the Australian people had and that actually turned the result. It was the Nationals that led that. We\u2019ve had the courage on nuclear energy, something that our party room has believed in for a very long time \u2026 it was us. It was our party room that delivered it.

Rishworth was previously minister for social services, which has now been passed to Tanya Plibersek, and the NDIS, which has been handed to Mark Butler. She said she was \u201chonoured to continue to serve in an Albanese Labor cabinet\u201d. Ministers Burke and Watt have made an outstanding contribution in this role in our first term of government. I got into politics to ensure all Australians can reach their potential and to create opportunities for everyone. I\u2019m proud to have served as minister for social services in a Labor government, and for the achievements we have made in the first term. I\u2019m grateful too for my time spent as minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme following Bill Shorten\u2019s retirement. I look forward to continuing our government\u2019s work to ensure Australians have the opportunity to obtain and retain well-paid and secure jobs. Share Updated at 07.46 CEST\n\n3h ago 07.21 CEST Alfred could become most expensive weather event for insurers since 2023 Christmas storms Ex-tropical cyclone Alfred may not have produced as much carnage as expected, but the damage bill for insurers is still steep, AAP reports. The weather system swept across south-east Queensland in March, knocking down trees, flooding roads, eroding beaches and cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people. It was forecast to strike as a category two system, but was downgraded to a tropical low after making landfall. More than 116,000 claims for damage totalling $1.236bn have been made to insurers to date, data from the Insurance Council of Australia shows. The lion\u2019s share (104,389) were related to homes, but many businesses (8,118) and vehicles (3,725) didn\u2019t escape unscathed. So far, insurers have settled 37% of the claims, worth $146m. Alfred could become the most expensive weather event for insurers since Queensland, NSW and Victoria were smashed by the 2023 Christmas storms, leading to $1.58bn in claims. But it is still well short of the $6.38bn in insurance claims stemming from record floods in NSW and Queensland in early 2022. Share Updated at 07.37 CEST",

    "title": "Anthony Albanese reveals new cabinet with Tanya Plibersek named as minister for social services",
    "body": "Tanya Plibersek has been moved out of the environment portfolio and into social services as part of Anthony Albanese\u2019s reshaped cabinet, replaced by Queenslander Murray Watt as Labor pursues a new model for its stalled \u201cnature positive\u201d laws.\n\nRevealing his refreshed lineup following Labor\u2019s emphatic election victory, Albanese on Monday named Michelle Rowland as the new attorney general, added the NDIS to Mark Butler\u2019s responsibilities alongside the health portfolio, and moved Anika Wells from aged care to communications.\n\nAmanda Rishworth was named the new employment and workplace relations minister, with frontbench newcomer Daniel Mulino appointed assistant treasurer.\n\nAnne Aly and Tim Ayres, two rising stars of the left, entered cabinet in key portfolios \u2013 Ayres taking Ed Husic\u2019s portfolio of industry, and Aly taking small business as well as multicultural affairs.\n\nIn a Canberra press conference, Albanese said Plibersek was \u201cvery positive\u201d about her move from environment. Watt, the Queensland left senator, will now have charge of passing Labor\u2019s nature positive changes and establishing a federal environmental protection agency, moves which were stalled under Plibersek after Albanese vetoed a deal she had negotiated in the Senate.\n\n\u201cI regard the environment as a really central portfolio,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cI regard it as very much a senior role in a Labor government. Murray will do it very well.\n\n\u201cI have got people who are, I think, in the best positions and that\u2019s across the board.\u201d\n\nHe said it was appropriate the NDIS was being moved into the health portfolio, coming as its $50bn price tag surges and as Labor tries to negotiate a new division of responsibility for childhood autism services with the states. In addition to Butler, NSW senator Jenny McAllister will have ministerial responsibility for the NDIS but will not sit in cabinet.\n\nAlbanese defended moves by factional chiefs including the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, to push out the former attorney general Mark Dreyfus and the former industry minister Husic. He said the rules under which the party\u2019s internal groupings selected frontbenchers were longstanding.\n\nAlbanese and Husic held private talks on Monday.\n\n\u201cWhat I have done is to allocate portfolios, that is the system that is there. It is one that Ed and others have supported for a long period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nAlbanese signalled the government had moved on from the report on gambling harms led by late Labor MP Peta Murphy. That inquiry\u2019s report, released in June 2023, called for a three-year phase-in period towards a total ban on gambling ads, but the government came under intense lobbying pressure and shelved its plans for implementation before the election.\n\nWells will have carriage of the issue as the minister for communications and sport.\n\nIn addition to cabinet and senior ministry changes, Albanese also announced a number of new assistant ministry and envoy roles.\n\nDan Repacholi, the re-elected Hunter MP, has been named to an envoy role responsible for men\u2019s health after starting some national conversations on that issue in his first term; Josh Burns, will be special envoy for social housing and homelessness, issues he has strongly advocated for in his seat of Macnamara in Melbourne.\n\nRebecca White, the former Tasmanian Labor leader, comes straight into the ministry as assistant minister for health, Indigenous health and women. Peter Khalil is the new assistant defence minister, while Queenslander Nita Green becomes the assistant minister for tourism, the Pacific and Northern Australia.\n\nAndrew Charlton, Kevin Rudd\u2019s former economic adviser and a rising star of the NSW right, is the new cabinet secretary and assistant minister for science and technology.\n\nAlbanese said he planned to travel to Rome for the inaugural mass of Pope Leo XIV at the weekend, likely extended travel for Wednesday\u2019s visit to Indonesia for talks with president Prabowo Subianto.\n\nEvents at the Vatican could include side meetings with the newly elected Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and possibly the US president, Donald Trump.\n\nAlbanese said papal celebration was an important event for Australian Catholics.\n\n\u201cMy mum would be pretty chuffed at the idea that her son will be going as prime minister to see the inauguration of a pope in the Vatican City.\u201d\n\nAlbanese\u2019s new cabinet:",

    "title": "Nurse who treated Joel Cauchi for schizophrenia threw up when told about Bondi Junction stabbings, inquest hears",
    "body": "A nurse at the Queensland medical practice where Joel Cauchi was treated for schizophrenia remembers him as a \u201ccompliant\u201d and \u201cdiligent\u201d patient, telling an inquest she vomited when she learned he had fatally stabbed six people at a Sydney shopping centre.\n\nCauchi, 40, killed Ashlee Good, 38, Jade Young, 47, Yixuan Cheng, 27, Pikria Darchia, 55, Dawn Singleton, 25, and Faraz Tahir, 30, and injured 10 others at Westfield Bondi Junction on 13 April last year before he was shot and killed by police inspector Amy Scott.\n\nCauchi was treated at a private Queensland clinic from 2012, after being discharged from the public health system after 11 years in its care. Known only as RN2, the mental health nurse said she saw Cauchi on a monthly basis from 2015 to 2017, when she monitored his psychotropic medication for his schizophrenia and OCD.\n\nShe learned of the stabbings when she was sent a text stating the Bondi Junction attacker was from Toowoomba.\n\n\u201cI looked it up and then I vomited when I saw it was him,\u201d she told the court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd, it\u2019s incongruent with what I know of Joel. It really doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\n\u201cI was incredibly shocked. I wouldn\u2019t have ever thought that was something that he would have done. I had a very visceral response to that.\u201d\n\nIn the third week of the five-week inquest into the seven deaths, the Lidcombe coroner\u2019s court was exploring why Cauchi was weaned off psychotropic medication and how he dropped out of the mental health system from 2020.\n\nRN2 said Cauchi was \u201csomeone who was very compliant \u2026 He was never even late for appointments and there was no having to chase him up, he was very compliant.\n\n\u201cI actually thought he was relatively insightful and he was also concerned about his illness in that he was quite diligent in monitoring for signs of relapse. He didn\u2019t want to get unwell and he was very conscientious with regard to his mental health. I think that was evidenced by his punctuality and engagement with our service,\u201d the New South Wales coroner, Teresa O\u2019Sullivan, was told.\n\n\u201cHe had anxiety around it,\u201d RN2 said, adding that Cauchi \u201cwanted to get the support and do the right thing\u201d.\n\nCauchi had been prescribed Clopine (clozapine), indicating that he had treatment-resistant schizophrenia, she said.\n\n\u201cThat obviously meant that his condition was quite severe. However, because he was so compliant, he wasn\u2019t difficult to manage and he was stable as well.\u201d\n\nCauchi\u2019s treatment plan was to reduce the Clopine to the most effective level relative to the side effects \u2013 such as cognitive \u201cfuzziness\u201d and sedation \u2013 as opposed to ceasing the medication, the court heard.\n\nCauchi\u2019s medical notes from early 2016 showed he was \u201ceasier and more relaxed\u201d on a lower dose of Clopine. The nurse said she saw an improvement in his energy levels and \u201cmore quality of life\u201d and did not have any concerns about his medication being lowered.\n\nThe nurse left the practice and returned in 2019, by which time Cauchi had stopped taking Clopine altogether. She said she had never heard of a patient ending Clopine without moving to alternative drugs.\n\nOn 14 February 2020, the nurse spoke with Cauchi\u2019s mother after she called the practice expressing her concern about his inability to keep his unit tidy, the inquest heard on Monday.\n\nHe was preparing to move to Brisbane at the time. When she broached the subject with him, he would become irritable. Notes from that call were read to the court.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t seem to look after himself\u201d, the court heard, with dishes in his sink and \u201cmess everywhere\u201d. He was isolated, irritable and occasionally swearing, the practice was told.\n\n\u201cThat was out of character,\u201d the nurse said, adding that the concerns may have been due to Cauchi\u2019s developmental delay because of his illness \u2013 or early warning signs of relapse.\n\nCauchi\u2019s transfer of care \u2018less than ideal\u2019\n\nShortly afterwards, Cauchi moved to Brisbane and was discharged from the practice into the care of his GP in the Toowoomba area because he did not have a GP in Brisbane, the court heard.\n\nRN2 recalled a conversation between practice staff suggesting Cauchi\u2019s move from the area and its support network was \u201cless than ideal\u201d but that the team did not have specific concerns.\n\nShe said schizophrenia patients \u2013 who were often highly disorganised \u2013 having to self-manage their transfer to a new psychiatrist via a GP was \u201cnot an ideal system\u201d.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Sue Chrysanthou SC, the barrister for the families of Young, Singleton and Good, RN2 said the concerns of Cauchi\u2019s mother \u201cneeded to be taken seriously\u201d given he could have been falsely reporting his symptoms to the nurse and his psychiatrist.\n\nThe nurse agreed that it was inappropriate to go from monthly monitoring to zero care.\n\nWhen asked whether the practice should have followed up with Cauchi after March 2020 to check he had a new psychiatrist, she replied: \u201cIdeally.\n\n\u201cThe best system would be to ensure there was continuity of care,\u201d she said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was no recommendation for monthly monitoring by his treating psychiatrist.\n\nChrysanthou asked RN2 if Cauchi showed signs of violence, hallucination, hearing voices or discussed having a knife collection when on medication. He did not, the nurse replied.\n\nThe nurse said Cauchi would have had to have been deemed at risk of harm to himself or others to be detained under the Mental Health Act and forced to take antipsychotic medication.\n\n\u2018I want a totally porn free internet on my devices\u2019\n\nA year earlier, Cauchi\u2019s mental health had rung alarm bells with his mother.\n\nA second mental health nurse \u2013 known only as RN3 \u2013 who took over Cauchi\u2019s medication monitoring at the private practice in 2018, agreed that Cauchi was in good health in the months after he ceased taking Clopine.\n\nNotes from the practice, shown to the court, stated that in October 2018 Cauchi was \u201cexcelling in function, doing more than ever. Gym, looking for a unit, seeing employment agency for work, social activities, etc. Mum is happy with his progress\u201d.\n\nIn September 2019, the notes showed that Cauchi was still \u201cdoing well\u201d and finishing a Tesol certification but was sleeping poorly.\n\nOn 17 October 2019, Cauchi\u2019s mother began to express concerns about a possible relapse. The notes state that other than fatigue and less sleep, Cauchi showed no early warning signs of a relapse.\n\nThey discussed Cauchi joining a peer support program to help him transition from home to independent living. Cauchi\u2019s appointments were moved from monthly to weekly contact.\n\nBy the next month, Cauchi\u2019s mother was raising significant concerns with the practice about a possible relapse.\n\nHis mother said he was writing \u201ca lot of notes at home\u201d, some suggesting he was under satanic control. He had a desire for porn and said that she had observed a \u201cfunny walk\u201d and a \u201cchange in his gait\u201d. He wore many layers of clothes to prevent himself from getting sick.\n\nIn an email from Cauchi to the practice, dated 12 November 2019, Cauchi acknowledged he wanted to limit his porn exposure: \u201cCan we please cover some ideas for a porn free phone \u2026 I want a totally porn free internet on my devices\u201d he requested.\n\nIn an email from Cauchi\u2019s mother to the practice on 20 November 2019, she wrote: \u201cI have a feeling he is now hearing voices etc. He is very distracted, forgetful and the OCD is getting out of hand with him going through half a cake of soap in one shower \u2026 I would hate to see him have to go back into hospital after 20 years of being stable when on medication \u2026 He quite possibly won\u2019t let on what is going on in his head but I think you need to know how he is.\u201d\n\nRN3 said she took Cauchi\u2019s mother\u2019s concerns seriously, but that at that time, she \u201cdid not see any obvious signs of psychosis\u201d.\n\nRN3 said she encouraged Cauchi to restart antipsychotic medication, especially if there were early warning signs of relapse. But, the court heard, Cauchi\u2019s father\u2019s mental health history may have affected Cauchi\u2019s approach to treatment.\n\nThe practice notes show that Cauchi\u2019s father became adamant that he did not want his son to go on medication \u201cas it will kill him\u201d. He said he had been \u201ctraumatised by demons when awake and hears voices\u201d.\n\nIn late 2019, Cauchi saw a sex worker, after which he took a month\u2019s worth of HIV medication after becoming concerned about exposure to STIs.\n\nThe court heard that after Cauchi moved to Brisbane in March 2020, there was effectively no follow-up. Because he had moved from the Toowoomba area, he was no longer eligible for Medicare appointments over Skype.\n\n\u201cI was surprised that he was discharged,\u201d RN3 said.\n\nRecalling the day after the attack, RN3 said that RN2 called her to share the news of Cauchi\u2019s involvement. \u201cI was quite shocked. I had to \u2026 sit down,\u201d she said emotionally.\n\n\u201cMy thoughts went to all the people who knew Joel. The Joel we knew was not the person who did what happened on 13 April \u2026 We were all very shocked.\u201d\n\nShe said Cauchi \u201ccontinually presented well\u201d.",

The move comes after a government-led inquiry into last year\u2019s fire that destroyed a large shopping centre in Warsaw.

    "body": "Norway is to hand over the leadership of an intergovernmental body comprising countries with territory in the Arctic after what its foreign minister called a \u201cdifficult two years\u201d, during which there have been unprecedented tensions within the group\u2019s membership related to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and Donald Trump\u2019s threat to seize Greenland.\n\nThe Arctic Council requires consensus from all eight Arctic states \u2013 the US, Russia, Canada, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the kingdom of Denmark, which includes Greenland, and Sweden \u2013 for all decisions and statements.\n\nDespite seismic divisions among its membership being played out under the global spotlight \u2013 particularly in relation to Russia, and, since Trump\u2019s re-election, the US \u2013 the council remains active and intact.\n\nThe Norwegian foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, will hand over the rotating two-year chair to Greenland\u2019s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, at a meeting of the council on Monday.\n\nDenmark is due to take the presidency but in a signal that Copenhagen is attempting to reset its relations with Greenland \u2013 a former Danish colony that remains part of the Danish realm \u2013 after Trump\u2019s advances, Greenland is taking the chair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult two years to be frank because the global backdrop, the international backdrop, has made it impossible to have full business as usual,\u201d Eide told the Guardian. \u201cBut we were very eager to keep the council together, to maintain its membership and to have activity, and we are pleased to report that we achieved that.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that their goals \u2013 including on the oceans, the climate crisis and people in the north \u2013 were \u201climited\u201d but said the council, formed in 1996, had managed to maintain working relations despite considerable strain since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe were able to keep it together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in contrast to some other formats, nobody has left and nobody has suggested that we should not continue our work, and slowly, slowly, we were able to develop some practical cooperation.\u201d\n\nThe next two years could present even greater challenges as Trump continues to make threats about taking control of Greenland, and amid volatile relations between the US and its Arctic neighbours and changing dynamics between the US and Russia. China is also a growing presence in the region.\n\nFor a long time, Eide said, the council had managed to shield itself from politics farther south, but since the invasion of Ukraine that had become impossible. In spite of the changes, he believes it is vital to maintain Arctic unity.\n\n\u201cThere is still a desire to maintain a full circumpolar Arctic council in which all Arctic states are members,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are exactly eight countries bordering the Arctic and they are all members and we would not be happy if that was fragmented into different organisations.\u201d\n\nDespite this, Norway, like all of the Nordic countries, has dramatically changed its outlook on Russia, after relations had warmed considerably since the cold war with the two countries continuing to cooperate on the Barents Sea.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "title": "Zelenskyy challenges Putin to meet in person for peace talks",
    "body": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy has challenged Vladimir Putin to meet in person for peace talks in Istanbul on Thursday, in a dramatic gambit after a weekend of diplomatic flurry.\n\nHis comments came after Putin rejected a demand from Ukraine and European allies to sign up to a 30-day ceasefire, but said Russia was ready for direct negotiations with Ukraine. Putin said delegations from the two countries should meet on Thursday in Turkey.\n\nAlthough European leaders insisted there should be no negotiations until Putin agrees to a ceasefire, Donald Trump put pressure on Zelenskyy to agree \u201cimmediately\u201d to negotiations this week in a post on Truth Social. Shortly afterwards Zelenskyy went public with his surprise offer.\n\n\u201cWe await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,\u201d the Ukrainian president said in a statement. \u201cThere is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in T\u00fcrkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.\u201d\n\nThe two leaders have not communicated directly since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and there have been no publicly known talks between Moscow and Kyiv since March 2022, shortly after the war began.\n\nTrump said in a statement on his Truth Social platform that Ukraine should \u201cHAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Putin of Russia doesn\u2019t want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY. At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the U.S., will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!\u201d\n\nThe demand for a 30-day ceasefire was set out on Saturday during a visit to Kyiv by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, who together with Zelenskyy made a phone call to Trump before holding a joint press conference.\n\nBritain\u2019s Keir Starmer said that if Putin rejected the offer, \u201cwe will respond, working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions and increase our military aid for Ukraine\u2019s defence to pressure Russia back to the table\u201d.\n\n0:53 European leaders call for unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine \u2013 video\n\nPutin\u2019s response to the ultimatum came in the unusual form of a statement read out to journalists in a ceremonial Kremlin room at close to 2am local time. He accused Ukraine of breaking previous ceasefires, but said that \u201cdespite this\u201d he was suggesting the two parties meet for talks, which he said could take place in Istanbul this Thursday.\n\nHe did not say who would attend, though observers widely expected him to send his top diplomatic aides. \u201cWe are ready for serious talks with Ukraine, and we want to solve the root causes of the conflict,\u201d he said.\n\nPutin\u2019s tone appeared carefully calibrated to reject Europe\u2019s demands but also make Moscow appear to be playing constructively in the eyes of the Trump administration, which has tended to be much softer on Moscow than on Kyiv until recent days. Putin made a point of thanking the new US administration for its efforts to resolve the conflict.\n\nTrump\u2019s response suggests the tactic may have succeeded, delivering a significant blow to western unity. However, his Truth Social post also hinted at the frustration he has reportedly expressed in private in recent days over Moscow\u2019s hardline demands in the war in Ukraine.\n\nBy proposing a direct meeting with Putin in Istanbul, Zelenskyy appears to be seizing the initiative, putting pressure back on the Russian leader \u2013 who rarely travels spontaneously \u2013 to either attend or back down.\n\nPrior to Trump\u2019s intervention, Zelenskyy and his chief of staff Andriy Yermak had both ruled out talks before a ceasefire. \u201cFirst a 30-day ceasefire, then everything else,\u201d said Yermak.\n\n1:04 Putin says Russia wants 'serious negotiations with Ukraine' \u2013 video\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, had also written on X on Sunday morning that no talks would be possible until Putin agreed to the ceasefire. \u201cThere can be no negotiations while weapons are speaking. There can be no dialogue if, at the same time, civilians are being bombed,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe flurry of back-and-forth offers and ultimatums suggests fast-moving diplomacy around the conflict, but behind the rhetoric it is not clear how much of the fundamental positions of the two sides have changed.\n\nUkraine and its European allies want a full ceasefire, after which negotiations would start on a comprehensive settlement including a European \u201creassurance force\u201d inside Ukraine, the exact composition and duties of which are still under discussion among allies.\n\nPutin, on the other hand, wants to keep fighting to increase the pressure on Ukraine to sign up to a number of Moscow\u2019s core demands, which have changed little since the start of the war. As well as territorial claims to the regions it occupies, Moscow is expected to demand guarantees over Ukraine\u2019s future political and military decisions. The Kremlin has already made it clear it would not accept western troops stationed in Ukraine.\n\nA top Putin aide, Yuri Ushakov, said on Sunday that the previous first round of Istanbul talks, in spring 2022, should serve as the basis for any new negotiations. Leaked drafts of those discussions suggest that the Russian terms presented amounted to an effective surrender for Ukraine.\n\nTrump\u2019s support for Putin\u2019s idea came after his Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, backed the European position, in a sign that the US president is often unpredictable even for his own team. \u201cAs President Trump has repeatedly said, stop the killing!! An unconditional 30 day ceasefire first and, during it, move into comprehensive peace discussions. Not the other way around,\u201d Kellogg wrote on X.\n\nIn the hours after Putin\u2019s address on Sunday morning, Russia launched more than 100 drones at Ukraine, as a three-day ceasefire unilaterally declared by Putin came to an end.\n\nThe ceasefire was pegged to the 80th anniversary of victory in the second world war, for which Putin presided over a military parade in Moscow on Friday with guests who included the leaders of China and Brazil. Kyiv rejected that ceasefire, saying it was a cynical attempt to avoid attacks on Russia during the set-piece parade, while Moscow continues to reject calls for a longer-term ceasefire.",

Putin said he wants to address what he calls \u201cthe root causes of the conflict\u201d.\n\nIn response, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia\u2019s consideration of ending the war is a \u201cpositive sign\u201d and that Ukraine is open to direct talks with Russia later this week, but only if Moscow signs up to an unconditional ceasefire first.\n\nEuropean leaders from the UK, France, Germany and Poland demanded on Saturday in Kyiv that Putin agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting tomorrow or face \u201cmassive\u201d new sanctions. Putin has dismissed what he said was the attempt by some European powers to lay down \u201cultimatums\u201d.\n\nFrance\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, responded to Putin\u2019s proposal for direct talks by saying there can be no proper negotiations while \u201ccivilians are being bombed\u201d. German chancellor Friedrich Merz said Russia\u2019s offer to negotiate directly with Ukraine is \u201ca good sign\u201d but \u201cfar from sufficient\u201d.

Thanks for following along today. We are now closing this blog. You can read all our Ukraine coverage here. Share Updated at 17.09 CEST\n\n18h ago 16.36 CEST Ukrainian troops have carried out over 100 attacks on the western Russian region of Belgorod over the past day, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov has said. We have not been able to independently verify this information. Share Updated at 16.40 CEST\n\n18h ago 16.25 CEST Putin is 'wielding terror as leverage' and 'stalling for time' to avoid real 'path to peace' - Lithuanian foreign minister Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister, K\u0119stutis Budrys, has condemned Russia\u2019s continuing attacks on Ukraine despite Vladimir Putin\u2019s offer for talks on Thursday (for context: overnight, the Ukrainian air force said Russia attacked Ukraine with 108 drones). \u201cPutin\u2019s answer to yet another ceasefire proposal: a swarm of 100 drones raining down on Ukraine overnight,\u201d Budrys wrote in a post on X. \u201cPutin is playing his usual game \u2013 wielding terror as leverage and stalling for time to avoid any real path to peace.\u201d He added: Talking peace while Russian bombs keep falling on Ukrainian civilians is a farce. The rules are clear - unconditional ceasefire from Monday or face new tougher sanctions. The fact that Putin rushed to hold a press conference less than 24 hours after European leaders, backed by the US, demanded an unconditional ceasefire tells us everything. This approach works - and we must stick to it. Now we must follow through. If Russian guns do not go silent by Monday, a new round of sanctions must be enforced - without hesitation. Share\n\n19h ago 16.09 CEST When Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, he demanded that Ukraine renounce joining Nato, sharply cut its army, and \u201cprotect\u201d Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow\u2019s orbit. He since has also demanded that Kyiv withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022 but never fully occupied \u2014 Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. There are unconfirmed reports that the White House is considering recognising Russian control of Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, as part of a broad US proposal to end the war in Ukraine. Kyiv has said formally surrendering Crimea is a red line that goes against Ukraine\u2019s constitution and would be a concession unconscionable to Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russian officials also have said that any so-called peace deal should involve releasing Russian assets that were frozen in the west and lifting other US and EU sanctions.

Rubio said last month that Trump was still interested in trying to negotiate a truce deal, but added that the US had many other priorities around the world and was willing to \u201cmove on\u201d unless there were signs of progress.

Here is a summary of the call, provided by Turkey\u2019s directorate of communications: President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan spoke by phone with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The call addressed the T\u00fcrkiye-Russia relations as well as regional and global matters. Welcoming President Putin\u2019s statement for the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine to be resumed in \u0130stanbul, President Erdo\u011fan said that T\u00fcrkiye stands ready to host the negotiations that will lead to a lasting solution. Noting that a window of opportunity to achieve peace has opened, President Erdo\u011fan said that a comprehensive ceasefire would create the necessary environment for peace talks.

Writing in a post on X, Tusk, who was with other European leaders in Kyiv on Saturday, said: In response to our appeal, the Russians have proposed peace talks starting May 15. The world, however, \u0456s waiting for univocal decision on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. Ukraine is ready. No more victims! Share\n\n21h ago 13.23 CEST German chancellor says Russian proposal for Ukraine talks is 'far from sufficient' The new German chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Sunday that Russia\u2019s offer to negotiate directly with Ukraine is \u201ca good sign\u201d but \u201cfar from sufficient\u201d. \u201cWe expect Moscow to agree to a ceasefire that allows real talks to take place. First the weapons must be silenced, then the discussions can begin,\u201d he said in a statement carried by the Agence France-Presse news agency. Merz, who was confirmed as chancellor after a shaky start on Tuesday, has promised to put staunch support of Ukraine at the heart of his government amid persistent concerns over US security commitments to Europe under Donald Trump. As the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, Jon Henley, notes in this story, Merz is more open than his predecessor Olaf Scholz to sending German long-range missiles to Ukraine and to deploying German troops as part of a peacekeeping force. He joined the UK\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk in Kyiv on Saturday where they met Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a show of support for Ukraine.

It has maintained cordial ties with both sides and has voiced support for Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and provided it with military help, while opposing western sanctions on Russia.

In a phone call, Erdo\u011fan was quoted as having told Macron: A historic turning point has been reached in efforts to end the war between Ukraine and Russia, that this opportunity must be seized, and that Turkey is ready to provide all kinds of support, including hosting negotiations, to achieve a ceasefire and lasting peace. As a reminder, Russian president Vladimir Putin said the proposed talks with Ukraine \u2013 to \u201csolve the root causes of the conflict\u201d - should be held in the Turkish city of Istanbul on 15 May, as they have been before.

    "body": "Pope Leo XIV has called for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and pleaded for an end to global conflicts, which he likened to a \u201cthird world war in pieces\u201d.\n\nIn his first Sunday address at the Vatican, the new pontiff urged an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian aid in Gaza and the release of all hostages. He also welcomed the truce between India and Pakistan and referenced the end of the second world war in 1945.\n\nAppearing on the central balcony of St Peter\u2019s Basilica, Leo blessed tens of thousands of people gathered in St Peter\u2019s Square and echoed pleas for peace by his predecessor, Pope Francis. \u201cI, too, address the world\u2019s great powers by repeating the ever-present call, \u2018never again war\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was the pope\u2019s first public appearance since he stepped out on a balcony last Thursday after a two-day conclave that elected him as the 267th pope. Previously a little-known cardinal, Robert Prevost, 69, is the first US leader of the Catholic church.\n\nView image in fullscreen Pope Leo XIV on the central balcony of St Peter\u2019s Basilica, wearing a simple white cassock, and singing instead of reciting the Regina Caeli prayer. Photograph: Ciancaphoto Studio/Getty Images\n\nVatican observers seeking clues to the direction and style of his papacy noted he delivered the blessing not from a studio window used by his predecessors, but from the central balcony. He wore a simple white cassock without the formal red cape, and instead of reciting the Latin Regina Caeli prayer, he sang it.\n\n\u201cI carry in my heart the sufferings of the beloved Ukrainian people,\u201d he said. \u201cLet everything possible be done to achieve genuine, just and lasting peace as soon as possible.\u201d Speaking amid renewed international pressure on Russia to halt hostilities, Leo called for the release of war prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children to their families.\n\nHe also urged a ceasefire in Gaza, which Israeli forces have continued to pound, the return of hostages seized in the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, and humanitarian aid for the \u201cexhausted civilian population\u201d. Food and medicine shortages have left babies severely malnourished.\n\nLeo noted that many countries celebrated Mother\u2019s Day on Sunday and wished all mothers, \u201cincluding those in heaven\u201d, a happy Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nEarlier, he celebrated a private mass in the grottoes beneath St Peter\u2019s, which contain the tombs of previous popes. On Saturday, Leo crossed Rome to pray at the tomb of Francis, who broke with tradition by asking to be buried at the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. Leo\u2019s formal installation mass is due next Sunday, 18 May.",

    "title": "Trump says planned gift of luxury plane from Qatar is a very \u2018transparent\u2019 deal",
    "body": "Donald Trump has indicated he is ready to accept a luxury plane being offered to the US president as a gift from Qatar\u2019s royal family, almost immediately igniting accusations of bribery and corruption as well as commensurate criticism.\n\nA statement from Qatar on Sunday acknowledged it had held discussions with the US about \u201cthe possible transfer\u201d of a plane to be used temporarily by Trump as his presidential aircraft, usurping Air Force One. The emirate\u2019s statement denied a final decision over the transfer had been made \u2013 or that it was a gift.\n\nLate on Sunday however Trump himself appeared to confirm the plan in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\n\u201cSo the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,\u201d he wrote.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, ABC reported that the Trump administration was girding itself to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8, a jumbo jet from the Qatari royals that was estimated to be worth about $400m and which has been described as a \u201cflying palace\u201d. Trump would then use the 13-year-old plane as the new Air Force One until shortly before the conclusion of his second Oval Office stint, at which point it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation no later than 1 January 2029.\n\nThe luxury gift from Qatar was expected to be announced next week during Trump\u2019s three-day tour of the Middle East that includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, ABC reported. Yet a Qatari spokesperson said it was \u201cinaccurate\u201d to say that the jet would be gifted \u201cduring the upcoming visit of president Trump\u201d.\n\nTrump toured the opulent plane in February while it was parked at the Palm Beach international airport, ABC added.\n\nAssuming Trump accepts the plane as planned, the jumbo jet would first be transferred to the US air force so the military branch could configure the aircraft to meet the specifications required for presidential travel, ABC\u2019s sources told the network. The network added that any costs affiliated with its transfer would be paid for by the US air force, which receives a significant portion of the revenue generated by federal taxpayers.\n\nAccording to ABC\u2019s sources, Trump\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi, and his top White House lawyer, David Warrington, have pre-emptively concluded that it is \u201clegally permissible\u201d for Trump to accept the luxury gift and then transfer it over to his presidential library.\n\nBoth reportedly arrived at that conclusion after lawyers for the White House counsel\u2019s office as well as the justice department said the gifted plane was not conditioned on any official act and therefore was not bribery.\n\nThose lawyers drafted an analysis for defense secretary Pete Hegseth, which reiterated that nothing about the plane violated federal laws prohibiting US government officials accepting gifts from foreign states or their royals. In fact, ABC\u2019s sources said, Bondi\u2019s reading of the situation was that the plane was being given to the US air force and then Trump\u2019s presidential library foundation rather than her boss himself.\n\nNevertheless, reports of the highly unusual \u2013 if not unprecedented \u2013 gift that Trump\u2019s subordinates had afforded their blessing for him to receive triggered a wave of criticisms towards the president.\n\nThe Democratic senator Chuck Schumer quickly mocked Trump\u2019s political slogan of \u201cAmerica first\u201d.\n\n\u201cNothing says \u2018America First\u2019 like Air Force One, brought to you by Qatar,\u201d the US Senate minority leader from New York said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not just bribery \u2013 it\u2019s premium foreign influence with extra legroom.\u201d\n\nOn X, Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman of Maryland, said: \u201cTrump must seek Congress\u2019 consent to take this $300m from Qatar. The Constitution is perfectly clear: no present of any kind whatever\u2019 from a foreign state without Congressional permission. A gift you use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift (and a grift).\u201d\n\nDemocratic pollster Matt McDermott echoed similar sentiments, saying: \u201cLiterally speechless\u2026\n\n\u201cA foreign regime gifting a jet to a former president. It\u2019s bribery in broad daylight.\u201d\n\nMcDermott remarked that the Trump Organization run by the president\u2019s children only days earlier had announced a new $5.5bn golf course in Qatar.\n\n\u201cToday: Qatar \u2018gifts\u2019 Trump a luxury jet. Surely just a coincidence,\u201d McDermott said.\n\nMeanwhile, Juliette Kayyem, a Harvard University international security professor, said: \u201cThe surveillance and security aspects are also as disturbing as the grift.\u201d\n\nThe CNN security analyst added: \u201cQatar will surely offer a plane that satisfies their needs as well.\u201d\n\nJonathan Reiner, a CNN medical analyst, took to X and said: \u201cAir Force One is a (checks notes) Air Force plane. A military aircraft. It\u2019s not intended to be a palace because the US doesn\u2019t have a king.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, a prolific Trump scoopster, wrote that the plane in question was \u201clikely the most expensive gift from a foreign government in US history and will likely raise questions from legal experts\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cIf Trump continued using it out of office, it would give him access to a much more modern plane than Trump Force One,\u201d which is a private Boeing 757 built in 1991 that belongs to the organization run by his sons.",

    "title": "India and Pakistan both claim victory after ceasefire declared",
    "body": "India and Pakistan have both claimed victory after a ceasefire was declared over the weekend, which brought the two nuclear-nations back from the brink of war.\n\nAfter days of escalating clashes that culminated in both sides launching missile and drone strikes on each other\u2019s major military bases \u2013 the closest they had come to full-scale war in decades \u2013 the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was declared by Donald Trump on Saturday evening.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump further congratulated the two countries on \u201chaving the strength, wisdom and fortitude to fully know and understand that it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much\u201d.\n\nWithin hours of the truce announcement, there were fears it had fallen apart after firing restarted along the disputed border in Kashmir and missiles and drones were once again launched into Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nHowever, by Sunday morning things were quiet on both sides of the frontier, leading many to hope the fragile peace would hold. Each side accused the other of triggering the violations and Pakistan said it remained \u201ccommitted to faithful implementation of ceasefire\u201d.\n\nThe Indian army said in a press briefing it had conveyed a message, through its \u201chotline\u201d with Pakistan, that if there were any more cross-border provocations \u201cour firm and clear intent to respond to these fiercely\u201d.\n\nBoth India and Pakistan claimed the ceasefire as a victory, fuelling a surge of nationalistic fervour on both sides of the border. India\u2019s defence minister, Rajnath Singh, said on Sunday the \u201croar of Indian forces reached Rawalpindi, the very headquarters of the Pakistani army\u201d, referring to India\u2019s missile strikes on Pakistan\u2019s Nur Khan airbase.\n\nHe said the military offensive, named Operation Sindoor, was \u201cnot just a military action but a symbol of India\u2019s political, social and strategic willpower\u201d.\n\nIn Pakistan, parades were held near the border to shower the military with petals, and the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, declared 11 May to be a day \u201cin recognition of the armed forces\u2019 response to recent Indian aggression\u201d.\n\nWriting in Pakistan\u2019s Dawn newspaper, commentator Baqir Sajjad called the ceasefire a \u201ccalculated victory\u201d by Pakistan that \u201cfirmly denied a much stronger India the military edge and diplomatic narrative it sought to dominate\u201d.\n\nParties and rallies were held across the country to mark the day, particularly in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, which was on the frontline of weeks of aggressive cross-border shelling.\n\nRaja Farooq Haider Khan, a former leader of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, led a celebratory rally near the disputed Kashmir border. \u201cWe are celebrating the bravery of our armed forces today who defended us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe offered his gratitude to Trump for helping to resolve the conflict. \u201cThis time we were so close to war so his involvement was very welcome. But we have to say that without resolving the Kashmir issue long-term, peace can\u2019t prevail in the region.\u201d\n\nSahad, a resident in Neelum Valley in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, said the past few days had been the scariest of her life. \u201cNo one can be happier than us as we live under the shadow of border posts and Indian firings. Everyone is happy to have our normal lives back,\u201d she said.\n\nThere were also celebrations on the Indian side of the border. However, residents near the disputed frontier said that while a ceasefire was welcome, it did not solve the underlying problem of the often bloody dispute between India and Pakistan over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which goes back to the partition of India in 1947.\n\nLal Din, 55, a resident of Poonch, the worst-affected area along India\u2019s border in Kashmir, where hundreds of houses were destroyed and dozens killed in the cross-border fire, said Kashmiris has seen this same situation \u2013 \u201ctemporary ceasefires brokered by global powers\u201d \u2013 many times before.\n\n\u201cThe core issue remains unresolved \u2013 soldiers still face each other with weapons and tanks,\u201d he said. \u201cToday it was one dispute, tomorrow it will be another, and the guns will roar again, trapping civilians like me in the crossfire. We\u2019re just numbers in this clash of nuclear powers. I beg both sides: resolve your differences, live in peace, and let us live.\u201d\n\nAfter weeks of mounting tensions, the attacks this week began on Wednesday when Indian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people. India has said those strikes were aimed at \u201cterrorist infrastructure and terrorist training camps\u201d as retribution for an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which it blamed on Pakistani-backed extremists.\n\nThe situation escalated further after India accused Pakistan of two consecutive nights of drone attacks.\n\nThe US took sizeable credit for brokering Saturday\u2019s ceasefire, with Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, and JD Vance, the vice-president, reported to have spent 48 hours embroiled in intense diplomatic negotiations with the two countries, finally convincing them to lay down arms on Saturday. Other countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UK, were also credited.\n\nVance had initially said the US would not interfere in the escalating hostilities between the US and Pakistan, claiming it was \u201cnone of our business\u201d. However, according to sources, their attitude shifted after concerns were raised by US intelligence that the conflict posed a risk of escalating into a full nuclear threat.\n\nThe reportedly pro-active role played by the US in the ceasefire, including phone calls made by Trump himself, seemed to have piqued the president\u2019s interest in the subcontinent and he pledged to substantially increase trade with both India and Pakistan.\n\nAt a press briefing on Sunday, Indian military spokespeople offered more details on its offensive against Pakistan and claimed it was Pakistan that had first requested a ceasefire.\n\nIndia said five of its soldiers were killed by Pakistani firing over the border and claimed Pakistan lost about 40 solders in firing along the line of control. It also claimed to have killed 100 terrorists living over the border in Pakistan. The numbers could not be verified.\n\nIt also claimed to have \u201cdowned a few Pakistani planes\u201d, though it did not elaborate further. Asked about claims made by Pakistan, and backed up by expert analysis of debris, that Pakistani missiles had downed at least three Indian military jets during the offensive on Wednesday, including multimillion-dollar French Rafale jets, India said \u201closses are a part of conflict\u201d and that all its pilots had returned home.",

    "body": "A legal campaign group is planning a judicial review against the UK government\u2019s new planning bill, arguing it will result in a weakening of environmental protections which were fought for and created over decades.\n\nWild Justice is calling on the housing minister, Angela Rayner, to correct a parliamentary statement in which she told MPs the bill, which applies mainly to England and Wales, would not reduce the level of protection. Her words were echoed in a letter to the Guardian from the nature minister, Mary Creagh, who stated it did not repeal habitat or species protections or give a licence to do harm.\n\nThe group sent Rayner a pre-action protocol letter on Monday calling on her to \u201ccorrect the parliamentary record\u201d to make clear that her statement about environmental protection in the bill was not correct. If this does not take place, they will apply for a judicial review.\n\nWild Justice has produced a legal opinion stating the bill would weaken existing environmental protections, with a key factor the removal of the requirement to be sure beyond reasonable scientific doubt that a development would not have a negative impact on a protected site. Instead developers will be allowed to pay into a nature restoration levy scheme in an attempt to mitigate any environmental harm elsewhere. There is no guarantee any environmental improvements would be in the same locality or even in the same county. Campaigners have argued it is impossible to replace an ancient woodland or a chalk stream elsewhere.\n\nThe Office of Environmental Protection, the government\u2019s post-Brexit watchdog, also warns the draft of the legislation would remove safeguards for nature and put protected sites at risk.\n\nChris Packham, co-director of Wild Justice, said: \u201cGood people fought long and hard to put proper wildlife protection into law. And it helped, but hasn\u2019t stopped the relentless decline of the UK\u2019s biodiversity. And now, in a time of absolute crisis, we need to save every last tree, bird, butterfly or bug.\n\n\u201cSo how do the government think it\u2019s going to if they smash those laws up? \u2026 I really hope they rein it in and bow to the love, passion and determination of a nation of animal lovers.\u201d\n\nMinisters argue the new bill will speed up housing developments and large infrastructure projects by allowing developers to avoid the long delays in meeting environmental obligations at the site of their project, by paying into the fund (NRF) which will be used to create environmental improvement elsewhere.\n\nBut last week the government\u2019s own impact assessment revealed officials have very little evidence that nature obligations are a block to development.\n\nThe bill is being debated in committee in parliament on Monday, where several amendments have been suggested.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

    "body": "From 1h ago 09.43 CEST Starmer promises net migration will fall 'significantly' by end of this parliament Starmer is now taking questions. Q: Are you promising net migration will fall every year? Starmer says he wants to get net migration down significantly. But he does not commit to net migration falling every year. I promise that [net migration] will fall significantly, and I do want to get it down by the end of this parliament, significantly. Share Updated at 09.59 CEST\n\n8m ago 10.53 CEST Key points from Starmer's press conference on immigration Keir Starmer did not go into detail during his speech and Q&A in Downing Street this morning. The Home Office has not published the immigration white paper yet (although it has extensively trailed most or all of the key announcements), and this morning it felt as if Starmer\u2019s main concern was to set the political framework, rather than to explain the policy detail. Here are the main points he made. Starmer promised to cut net migration significantly by the end of this parliament. (See 8.43am.) He used the word \u201cpromise'\u201d several times, including in his opening statement when he said: Now, make no mistake, this plan means migration will fall. That\u2019s a promise. But he declined an invitation to promise that net migration would fall every year. (See 8.43am.) Asked if it would fall every year, he replied: I\u2019m promising it [net migration] will fall significantly, and I do want to get it down by the end of this parliament, significantly. That is what this plan is intended to achieve. He said that, if the white paper measures failed to bring down net migration significantly, \u201cfurther measures\u201d would be introduced. In his opening statement he said: I want to be very clear on this, if we do need to take further steps, if we do need to do more to release pressure on housing and our public services, then mark my words we will. He repeated this point during the Q&A \u2013 but without saying that those further measures might be. He rejected claims that curbing immigration would be bad for growth. Generally economists believe that immigration boosts growth, and this assumption has historically influenced the Treasury\u2019s approach to policy making. But, when asked about this, Starmer argued that the experience of the last few years showed that immigration doesn\u2019t always help growth. He said: The theory that higher migration numbers necessarily lead to higher growth has been tested in the last four years. We\u2019ve had the highest net migration when the last government lost control, to nearly on million, and stagnant growth. And so that link doesn\u2019t hold on that evidence. He also stressed that the white paper addressed skills and training. \u201cOne of the reasons that we\u2019ve had stagnant growth, in my view, for years, is because we\u2019ve under-invested chronically in skills and growth,\u201d he said. He rejected suggestions that Labour MPs might be \u201csqueamish\u201d about the government taking a tough line on immigration. Asked about this, he said: On squeamishness, I actually think that the Labour party has as core values the idea that immigration should be controlled, that it should be selective, we should be choosing who we want, higher skills, the high talent routes into our country. And it must be fair. He said Britain risked becoming \u201can island of strangers\u201d without fair immigration controls. In his opening statement he said: Nations depend on rules, fair rules. Sometimes they\u2019re written down, often they\u2019re not. But either way, they give shape to our values, guide us towards our rights, of course, but also our responsibilities, the obligations we owe to each other. Now in a diverse nation like ours, and I celebrate that, these rules become even more important. Without them, we risk becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together. He said he did not think it was \u201csensible\u201d to put a cap on annual net migration numbers, because previous attempts to do so had not worked. He said: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s sensible to put a hard edged cap on it. That has been done in one form or another for the best part of 10 years by different prime ministers. The only thing that links those prime ministers and the various caps or quotas or limits they put in place is \u2013 every single one of them failed, and therefore going down the failed route is not a sensible way for me, as with everything that I do, serious, pragmatic, looking at the things that will actually make a material difference. He said that, with the white paper, Labour is implementing the \u2018take back control\u2019 approach to immigration promised, but not delivered, by Brexiter Tories. (See 8.36am.) He dismissed claims that the white paper is just a response to Reform\u2019s electoral success. (See 8.39am.) View image in fullscreen Keir Starmer speaking at his press conference in Downing Street. Photograph: Ian Vogler/AFP/Getty Images Share\n\n1h ago 09.57 CEST Q: Do you think the UK needs to further disentangle itself from the European convention on human rights? Starmer says he does not think that is necessary. He says, if the UK does not comply with international law, it will not be able to sign international law enforcement agreements. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Share\n\n1h ago 09.55 CEST Starmer rejects claim he has changed his views on deporting foreign criminals Q: Five years ago you signed a letter objecting to the deportation of foreign criminals. Your views have changed, haven\u2019t they? Starmer rejects this. As DPP he was in favour of foreign criminals being deported, he says. He does not address the point raised by the letter he signed in 2020 \u2013 an issue that Tories have raised frequently in the past. Share\n\n1h ago 09.52 CEST Q: During the election you said you had a comprehensive plan to bring down illegal immigration. But that is not happening. So why should people believe your plan to control legal migration will work? Starmer says he is convinced that he can deal with illegal immigration by tackling the gangs. The border security bill will give the authorities new powers to tackle these gangs. But the Tories are voting against, he says. Share\n\n1h ago 09.51 CEST Starmer says controlling immigration is a core Labour value. People think the system should be fair. Share\n\n1h ago 09.50 CEST Starmer says, if further policies needed to cut net migration, he will introduce them Q: Why should people believe that you will succed where other governments failed? And why don\u2019t you set a target for reducing immigration? Starmer says this is a comprehensive plan. He wants to reduce net migration, he says. And he says, if he needs to go further to achieve that, he will. He also says in the past targets have not worked. Share Updated at 10.02 CEST\n\n1h ago 09.48 CEST Q: Have you changed your personal views on this? Did you used to believe immigration was good for growth? Starmer says at Labour conference three years ago he argued that taking back control was a Labour argument. He says he made the same argument in his speech to the CBI in 2022 too. Share\n\n1h ago 09.46 CEST Q: What is your reaction to the news that the US and China have agreed a trade deal? Starmer says he only saw this as he was coming to the press conference, and is not across the detail.

US and China agree to slash tariffs in trade war de-escalation\u2013 business live Read more Share Updated at 10.04 CEST\n\n1h ago 09.45 CEST Q: If you want to grow the economy, won\u2019t these plans make it harder because it will be more difficult for people to get UK citizenship? Starmer says he does not accept the argument that high immigration is always good for growth. The last government had high immigration but stagnant growth. Share\n\n1h ago 09.43 CEST Starmer promises net migration will fall 'significantly' by end of this parliament Starmer is now taking questions. Q: Are you promising net migration will fall every year?

I promise that [net migration] will fall significantly, and I do want to get it down by the end of this parliament, significantly. Share Updated at 09.59 CEST\n\n1h ago 09.41 CEST Starmer says he wants to tighten immigration rules because he believes in rules. Nations depend on rules, fair rules. Sometimes they\u2019re written down, often they\u2019re not, but either way, they give shape to our values, guide us towards our rights, of course, but also our responsibilities, the obligations we owe to each other. He says the current immigation system is \u201calmost designed to permit abuse, that encourages some businesses to bring in lower paid workers rather than invest in our young people\u201d. And he says this is something he has been arguing for for some years. Share\n\n1h ago 09.39 CEST Starmer rejects claim immigration white paper is just ploy to see off electoral threat from Reform UK Starmer says it is a mistake to view what he is annoucing today in just party political terms. He is referring to claims that this is just about seeing off the theat from Reform UK. He says: On a day like today, people who like politics will try to make this all about politics, about this or that strategy, targeting these voters, responding to that party. No, I\u2019m doing this because it is right, because it is fair and because it is what I believe in. Share\n\n1h ago 09.36 CEST Starmer says his policies will deliver 'take back control' of migration promised, but not delivered, by Tory Brexiters Keir Starmer is speaking now. He says this strategy is crucial to his Plan for Change. He is framing this in Brexit terms. He says the government is finally taking back control of our borders, and closing the book \u201con a squalid chapter for our politics\u201d. He goes on: Take back control \u2013 everyone knows that slogan, and everyone knows what it meant on immigration, or at least that\u2019s what people thought. Because what followed from the previous government, starting with the people who used that slogan, was the complete opposite. Between 2019 and 2023, even as they were going round our country telling people with a straight face that they would get immigration down, net migration quadrupled, until in 2023 it reached nearly 1 million. That\u2019s about the population of Birmingham, our second largest city. That\u2019s not control. It\u2019s chaos. And look, they must answer for themselves. But I don\u2019t think that you can do something like that by accident. It was a choice, a choice made even as they told you, told the country, they were doing the opposite \u2013 a one-nation experiment in open borders conducted on a country that voted for control. Well, no more. Today, this Labour government is shutting down the lab. The experiment is over. We will deliver what you\u2019ve asked for time and again, and we will take back control of our borders. Share Updated at 10.03 CEST\n\n2h ago 09.26 CEST The Conservatives have rejected suggestions that Keir Starmer is being tough on immigration. In a statement released overnight in response to the briefing about the white paper plans, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: Keir Starmer pretends to be tough, but just weeks ago his MPs voted against our 10-year residency and economic contribution test for indefinite leave to remain. Now he says that immigrants who make no contribution should still be allowed to stay. He is trying to take steal credit for recent substantial reductions in visa numbers that resulted from Conservative reforms in April 2024. Starmer also suspended the Conservative plan for a \u00a338,000 salary threshold for family visas. Will he now bring that back? Today Conservatives are forcing a vote on a binding migration cap and removing the Human Rights Act from immigration matters. But Starmer and Labour will vote it down. Starmer is the same man who wrote letters protesting against deporting dangerous foreign criminals and has overseen the worst ever start to a year for illegal immigrants crossing the channel. The idea that Starmer is tough on immigration is a joke. Philp is referring to a Tory amendment to the border security, asylum and immigration bill, which is going through its remaining stages in the Commons this evening. Share\n\n2h ago 09.19 CEST Care sector expresses alarm about plan to end international recruitment of care workers Care providers are worried about the proposals to end the international recruitment of care workers. In a statement issued yesterday, Jane Townson, CEO of the Homecare Association, which represents homecare providers, said: International recruitment is a lifeline for the homecare sector, enabling us to provide vital support to older and disabled people in their own homes. Care providers are already struggling to recruit within the UK. We are deeply concerned the government has not properly considered what will happen to the millions of people who depend on care at home to live safely and independently. And this morning Amy Clark, commercial director of a care home firm in Cornwall, told the Today programme that she did not think it was realistic for the government to expect care homes to recruit all their staff domestically. She said: The big problem that we would have is if we weren\u2019t able to recruit any overseas staff because recruiting locally is very, very difficult. We try all the time to recruit locally. We put our wages up, we still don\u2019t get applicants. We\u2019ve always paid higher than minimum wage, but that is becoming increasingly difficult, especially with the national insurance costs and also the national minimum wage increase and the pitiful uplift from the local authorities in relation to the social care funding. Share\n\n2h ago 08.56 CEST It is worth stressing that today\u2019s white paper is about legal immigration. Polling suggests that the public are worried about high levels of legal immigration, but the political debate about immigration is largely driven by concern about illegal, or irregular, immigration \u2013 people arriving in small boats, and being housed, particularly in hotels, if they are claiming asylum. Irregular immigration accounts for only a small proportion overall immigration. According to Office for National Statistics figures, 1.2 million came to live in the year ending June 2024. During that period, 39,000 people arrived on small boats. Most of them tried to claim asylum, and this chart, from the ONS, shows the asylum numbers compared to people coming to the UK through other routes. View image in fullscreen How people came to UK in year ending June 2024 Photograph: ONS This is widely misunderstood. In its briefing on the local elections published last week, the campaign group More in Common released polling showing that many voters \u2013 and more than half of Tory and Reform UK supporters \u2013 believe more than 50% of immigration to the UK is illegal. (More in Common says the real number is closer to 10%.) Lib Dem and Green supporters are the best informed, but even around a third of them believe the \u2018more than 50%\u2019 fiction.

Labour\u2019s immigration shake-up challenges decades of party policy Read more And here is an extract. [The white paper] will challenge a central tenet of Labour\u2019s economic policies for decades: that immigration is broadly good because it helps the economy to grow. Government insiders say that the \u201cfailed free-market experiment\u201d of allowing overseas workers to freely enter the UK has been a major factor in generating political chaos over the past decade. In his insistence that foreign workers should learn \u201cour language\u201d, Keir Starmer appears to have adopted elements of the populist language once closely associated with Nigel Farage. It is the kind of language that generated criticism from Labour politicians when used by the Reform UK leader more than a decade ago. Share Updated at 08.34 CEST",

    "body": "Preserving the British role in the F-35 jet fighter programme takes precedence over the need to comply with UK laws on arms export controls, or any UK obligation to prevent a genocide in Israel, UK government lawyers will argue in court this week.\n\nThe long-awaited high court case will test whether ministers have broken the law by continuing to supply parts for the F-35 programme that may be used by Israel to attack Palestinians in Gaza. The four-day case starts on Tuesday and has taken nearly a year to come to court.\n\nIt has been brought by Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq but is supported by a raft of British human rights groups including Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, Oxfam and the Global Legal Action Network (Glan).\n\nThe court action has already had impact; in September last year, the UK suspended some arms export licences 90 minutes before it was due to appear in court to defend the continued arms export licences to Israel.\n\nIn making the announcement in September suspending 30 arms export licences, ministers gave a carve out for the supply of UK components to the global pool of F-35 jets, saying such disruption to the entire F-35 programme would be a threat to Nato\u2019s peace and security.\n\nIn papers to the court, the UK has acknowledged that its supply of F-35 components for potential use in Israel is in breach of its own arms export control laws. The laws state that arms export licences must not be granted \u201cif there is a clear risk those items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law by Israel\u201d. The UK government\u2019s lawyers say the maintenance of the global F-35 supply chain is of paramount importance and parts are not being supplied directly to Israel.\n\nBritain supplies 15% of the value of the F-35 jet, including ejector seats, rear fuselage, active interceptor systems, targeting lasers and weapon release cables, mainly through British Aerospace. The UK is the second largest supplier of spare parts for the jet after the US.\n\nThe UK insists it is not possible to set conditions on the use of these components, such as requiring Lockheed Martin to temporarily ban sales of F-35s to Israel.\n\nJennine Walker, a barrister representing Al-Haq, said it was absurd for the government to argue peace and security is a good reason for the government to depart from its own arms export policies.\n\nShe said: \u201cOf course it is possible for the government to stop British made parts for F-35s being supplied to Israel without the whole global programme being affected, without any significant implications for international peace and security. What really undermines international peace and security is these flagrant violations of the law.\u201d\n\nCharlotte Andrews-Briscoe, a Glan lawyer representing Al-Haq, underlined the importance of the F-35s to the Israeli war effort, describing their impact as \u201ccatastrophic and continuing\u201d.\n\nShe said Israeli pilots say they are working around the clock and non-stop, having undertaken 15,000 flight hours and 8,000 missions since 7 October, when thousands of Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 hostages. In response, the Israeli campaign has killed more than 52,000 people and reduced much of the territory to ruins. \u201cThese war planes cause deaths and life-changing injuries. They also support ground troops that are intentionally starving an already decimated population.\u201d\n\nF-35s, she said, played a critical role, for instance on 18 March, when Israel broke the ceasefire with a wave of airstrikes that killed more than 400, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The dead included 183 children and 94 women, Palestinian officials said.\n\nShe also warned that the way the government had chosen to mount its legal case risked undermining the relevance of international law. She said: \u201cThe government has concluded the Geneva conventions have no domestic application unless and until an international court has ruled conclusively on the commission of genocide, which the government admit is likely to be years from now. If the court accepts these arguments it would completely gut the meaning of the duty to prevent genocide under international law\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It added more than 1,000 F-35s currently operate with a high proportion undertaking either UK or Nato operations.\n\nMaking such judgments about national security, the government has argued, is primarily to be a matter for the executive.",

    "title": "Green party must choose again between election-focused or activist leaders",
    "body": "So here we are again. Much as was the case in 2021, the last time the Greens picked their leaders, members have a choice that could be broadly presented as the more sober, election-focused professionals versus insurgent activists.\n\nOn one side of the equation are Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, both MPs, and in the case of Ramsay, already a co-leader. Four years ago, he and Carla Denyer saw off Amelia Womack and Tamsin Omond with a self-stated mission to change the party and win elections.\n\nWhile Womack was hardly an outsider \u2013 by then she had been deputy leader for seven years \u2013 she was running with Omond, a climate activist who co-founded Extinction Rebellion, and their candidacy was seen as more aimed at younger Greens, and those with an interest in direct activism.\n\nIn this summer\u2019s leadership election, for which party members in England and Wales will vote during August, Ramsay and Chowns are up against Zack Polanski, who took over from Womack as deputy leader in 2022 and wants to turn the Greens into what he called an \u201ceco-populism\u201d mass movement.\n\nAs a London assembly member who hopes to also become an MP, Polanski is not averse to the electoral route. But his view is that the Greens could and should do more to match the appeal of Reform UK, which is polling at about three times the level of the Greens and has a membership about four times the size.\n\nRamsay and Chowns are expected to be the favourites and have one particularly strong card to play: they can point to the approach already taken by the outgoing leadership team, and argue that it worked.\n\nWhen they took over from Si\u00e2n Berry and Jonathan Bartley, Ramsay and Denyer promised to build up the Greens\u2019 councillor base with a view to expanding the party\u2019s single parliamentary seat.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ellie Chowns and Adrian Ramsay can argue that the approach taken by the outgoing leadership team has worked. Photograph: Team Ellie & Adrian\n\nIn 2023 came a more specific promise, to win in four specific Westminster constituencies, a target many observers \u2013 and some Greens \u2013 viewed at the time as hugely ambitious. But nine months later, at the general election, it happened.\n\nTwo of the wins were in Green-friendly, Labour-facing seats \u2013 Berry successfully took over Brighton Pavilion from the departing Caroline Lucas, while Denyer, a Bristol councillor since 2015, removed the Labour frontbencher Thangam Debbonaire from Bristol Central.\n\nMore notable still were the victories for Ramsay and Chowns, in rural and fundamentally Conservative areas. Ramsay won the newly created constituency of Waveney Valley on the Norfolk-Suffolk border and Chowns overturned a near-25,000 majority in the previously Tory constituency of North Herefordshire.\n\nThe pair can thus present themselves to Green voters as exemplars of the party\u2019s long-term mission of building up a Westminster presence via local government, with both serving as councillors in the areas they eventually won.\n\nThis approach is being spread more widely, with the Greens holding more than 850 councillors on 180-plus local authorities, and finishing second last year in 40 parliamentary seats.\n\nPolanski\u2019s counterargument is not that this approach is wrong, simply that it should be allied with a less cautious approach to policy and presentation, one that would transmit Green messages to potentially supportive voters with more urgency.\n\nPolanski, who trained as an actor and is happy to take on even hostile broadcast hosts, is arguably a more natural media performer than Ramsay or Chowns. On the debit side for some members will be a policy approach that can raise eyebrows, such as last week\u2019s suggestion that the UK should quit an \u201cout-of-date\u201d Nato.\n\nWhich version will win out? In some ways it is hard to predict, not least because this is the first leadership election for four years in a party that normally holds them every two. Ramsay and Denyer were initially given a three-year period as Berry and Bartley broke their tenure midway, with the general election then delaying it again.\n\nAnd then there is the size of the party \u2013 yes, smaller than Reform but now above 60,000. In 2021, Ramsay and Denyer won easily with just 5,000 first-round votes, on a turnout of about 20%. If one side or another can motivate the members, anything could happen.",

    "body": "Adrian Ramsay is to stand as Greens co-leader with another of the party\u2019s MPs, Ellie Chowns, amid what the duo describe as an unprecedented fracturing of political allegiances that meant it was vital to have leaders in Westminster with a proven record of winning.\n\nRamsay has already been co-leader for four years, alongside Carla Denyer, who with Ramsay, Chowns and Si\u00e2n Berry were elected to parliament last year in the party\u2019s greatest electoral triumph.\n\nLast week, Denyer revealed to the Guardian that she would not re-contest the leadership, instead focusing on her Bristol Central constituency and campaigns such as net zero and affordable housing.\n\nWhile nominations for the leadership do not formally open until next month, the contest is likely to be between Ramsay and Chowns, and Zack Polanski, the current deputy leader, who has already announced a bid to take the party towards what he called a Reform-emulating \u201ceco-populism\u201d.\n\nWhile praising the outgoing duo\u2019s achievements, Polanski said he believed the Greens should be less cautious, and try to emulate Reform in becoming an insurgent, mass-membership political force.\n\nUnveiling their joint bid to the Guardian, Ramsay and Chowns dismissed this implicit criticism, saying that their record in winning rural, Conservative-dominated seats in July showed they could win over new supporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve both won seats that were previously considered unwinnable,\u201d said Chowns, who overturned a near-25,000 Tory majority to win her North Herefordshire seat. Ramsay\u2019s Waveney Valley constituency, on the Norfolk-Suffolk border, was made up from parts of previously Conservative seats.\n\n\u201cWe know what it means to win against the odds. We know what it means to build the biggest possible, most inclusive possible campaign teams, to inspire people to take action that results in previously unthinkable political change,\u201d she added.\n\nAsked about Polanski\u2019s criticisms, Ramsay said such results showed they could take the Greens\u2019 message \u201cto people who don\u2019t normally vote for you\u201d, and that it would be hard for a non-MP to lead the party.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe reality is the MPs are setting the tone of what the Green party is saying on the issues of the day, because they\u2019re being debated in parliament. There\u2019s a reason why parties have their leaders as MPs.\u201d\n\nThe need to focus on electoral growth was all the more vital, he said, with the current \u201ccrossroads in British politics\u201d, with polls showing Westminster voting intentions are now closely matched between five parties.\n\nIn what could be seen as a coded swipe at Polanski, Ramsay warned against the Greens seeking to \u201cappeal to your existing supporters or to a particular base\u201d, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing with Kemi Badenoch and the Conservatives what can happen if a party elects a leader just based on appealing to a particular base of support.\u201d\n\nAs a new MP \u2013 and the only one of the four Greens in parliament to never lead the party \u2013 Chowns is less well-known but also very experienced, having been a councillor and, briefly, an MEP with a background in international development.\n\nShe said her and Ramsay would be \u201ca really well-matched pair\u201d as leaders. With the previous team, Denyer was more likely than the slightly quieter Ramsay to be sent into mass-party TV debates, a role Chowns seems set to follow.\n\n\u201cBoth of us have got a huge history in the Green party,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are MPs, so we have that credibility of already being there at the heart of UK politics. And I think it\u2019s really important for the party that our leaders are MPs, there every day, speaking out on that key political platform.\u201d",

Shares in Novo Nordisk, which is listed in Frankfurt, dropped by 7.5%, while the Swiss group Roche Holdings dropped by 3.6%.\n\nIn South Korea, shares in SK Biopharmaceuticals and Samsung Biologics fell by as much as 2.7% and 4.7%, respectively. In Hong Kong, BeiGene dropped 8.9% and Innovent Biologics fell by 7%.\n\nTrump targeted high drug costs during his first administration, which aimed to cap prices for certain medicines under Medicare. However, it was struck down in federal court after a challenge from drug companies.\n\nThe American government does already negotiate prices for some of the most expensive medicines used in Medicare, a federal health insurance programme, under then president Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.

    "body": "Hamas announced on Sunday that it would release the last living American hostage in Gaza, Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American soldier who was kidnapped on 7 October 2023.\n\nDonald Trump confirmed the news in a social media post, writing that Alexander, 21, \u201cis coming home to his family\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators \u2014 Qatar and Egypt \u2014 to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,\u201d the US president added.\n\nThe captive\u2019s release is set to take place on Tuesday, Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with the matter.\n\nTrump begins a trip to the Middle East the same day, although there is no stop in Israel on his schedule as of yet. The president is set to visit Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.\n\nTrump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz he would travel to Israel on Monday. \u201cRight now, the intention is to return Edan Alexander home to his family,\u201d Witkoff said.\n\nAdam Boehler, the US special envoy for hostage affairs, is traveling to Israel with Alexander\u2019s parents, a US official told Axios.\n\nThe office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement: \u201cThe US has informed Israel of Hamas\u2019s intention to release soldier Edan Alexander as a gesture to the Americans, without conditions or anything in exchange. The US has conveyed to Israel that this is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of hostages according to the original Witkoff framework, which Israel has already accepted. Israel is preparing for the possibility that this effort will be implemented.\u201d\n\nIn a later statement, his office added: \u201cIsrael has not committed to a ceasefire of any kind or the release of terrorists but only to a safe corridor that will allow for the release of Edan.\u201d\n\nNegotiations would \u201ccontinue under fire, during preparations for an intensification of the fighting\u201d, it added.\n\nIsrael will not be asked to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of Alexander, Axios reports, but will have to agree to a temporary ceasefire and a halt to drone flights over Gaza to allow Alexander to safely leave the enclave.\n\nAlexander\u2019s family said in a statement released by the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum: \u201cThe family confirms that it has been informed of Hamas\u2019s announcement and that it is in constant contact with the American government regarding the possibility of Edan\u2019s expected release in the coming days.\u201d\n\nBoehler, the hostage envoy, told Reuters the planned release of Alexander was \u201ca positive step forward\u201d and asked for Hamas to also release of the bodies of four other Americans who have died in captivity in Gaza.\n\nAccording to Haaretz, the four dead Americans include two who were serving in the Israeli military, Omer Neutra, 21, and Itay Hen, 19, and two older Israeli-Americans, Judih Weinstein-Haggai, 70, and her husband Gad Haggai, 73, were living in the Israeli kibbutz Nir Oz on the Gaza border when it was raided by Hamas-led militants on 7 October.\n\nKhalil al-Hayya, a Hamas leader in Gaza, said in a statement the group was ready to \u201cimmediately start intensive negotiation\u201d to reach a final deal that will end Israel\u2019s deadly war on Gaza.\n\nOver the last year and a half, Israeli forces have killed at least 52,800 Palestinians while forcibly displacing 2 million survivors \u2013 including babies \u2013 across the narrow strip amid widespread food and aid shortages due to Israeli restrictions.\n\nMeanwhile, 59 hostages remain in Gaza. According to Trump, just 21 remain alive.\n\nThe governments of Qatar and Egypt, which have been brokering talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza, said in a joint statement that Hamas\u2019s decision to release Alexander was \u201ca gesture of goodwill and a positive step toward resuming negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire\u201d.\n\nAlexander, who was born in Israel but raised in the US by Israeli parents, moved to Israel in 2022 after graduating high school and enlisted in the Israeli military.\n\nHis parents and two younger siblings still live in Tenafly, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cPray that Hamas follows through and Edan gets to come home,\u201d JD Vance, the US vice-president, posted online on Sunday. \u201cIf they do, it will have been another triumph of Steve Witkoff, who continues to face withering attacks for freeing hostages, negotiating complex diplomatic proposals, and serving his country (at great financial cost)\u201d.",

    "title": "Trump administration offers refugee status to 49 white South Africans",
    "body": "A group of 49 white South Africans departed their homeland on Sunday for the United States on a private charter plane having been offered refugee status by the Trump administration under a new program announced in February.\n\nThe group, which included families and small children, was due to arrive at Dulles international airport outside Washington DC on Monday morning local time, according to Collen Msibi, a spokesperson for South Africa\u2019s transport ministry.\n\nThey are the first Afrikaners \u2013 a white minority group in South Africa \u2013 to be relocated after Donald Trump issued an executive order in February accusing South Africa\u2019s Black-led government of racial discrimination against them and announcing a program to offer them relocation to the US.\n\nThe South African government said it is \u201ccompletely false\u201d that Afrikaners are being persecuted.\n\nThe Trump administration has fast-tracked their applications while pausing other refugee programs, halting arrivals from Afghanistan, Iraq, most of sub-Saharan Africa and other countries in a move being challenged in court.\n\nRefugee groups have questioned why the white South Africans are being prioritized ahead of people from countries wracked by war and natural disasters. Vetting for refugee status in the US often takes years.\n\nThe Trump administration says the South African government is pursuing racist, anti-white policies through affirmative action laws and a new land expropriation law it says targets Afrikaners\u2019 land. The government says those claims are based on misinformation and there is no racism against Afrikaners and no land has been expropriated, although the contentious law has been passed and is the focus of criticism in South Africa.\n\nTrump himself falsely claimed to reporters South Africa\u2019s leaders were \u201ctaking away land, they\u2019re confiscating land\u201d.\n\nAs the Financial Times columnist Simon Kuper pointed out last year, several of the most influential voices around Trump \u201care fiftysomething white men with formative experiences in apartheid South Africa\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cElon Musk lived in apartheid South Africa until he was 17. David Sacks, the venture capitalist who has become a fundraiser for Donald Trump and a troll of Ukraine, left aged five, and grew up in a South African diaspora family in Tennessee. Peter Thiel spent years of childhood in South Africa and Namibia, where his father was involved in uranium mining as part of the apartheid regime\u2019s clandestine drive to acquire nuclear weapons,\u201d Kuper wrote.\n\nSouth Africa also denies US claims that Afrikaners are being targeted in racially motivated attacks in some rural communities. Instead, the South African government said Afrikaners \u2013 who are the descendants of Dutch and French colonial settlers \u2013 are \u201camongst the most economically privileged\u201d in the country.\n\nThe first Afrikaner refugees were traveling on a flight operated by the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based charter company Omni Air International, Msibi said. They departed from Johannesburg, where they were accompanied by police officers and airport officials when they checked in. Msibi said they would have to be vetted by police to ensure there were no criminal cases or outstanding warrants against them before being allowed to leave.\n\nThe South African government said there was no justification for them being relocated but said it wouldn\u2019t stop them and respected their freedom of choice.\n\nThey are expected to be greeted at Dulles by a US government delegation, including the deputy secretary of state and officials from the Department of Health and Human Services, whose refugee office has organized their resettlement.\n\nThe flight will be the first in a \u201cmuch larger-scale relocation effort\u201d, the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, told reporters on Friday. Miller said that what was happening to Afrikaners in South Africa \u201cfits the textbook definition of why the refugee program was created\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen South Africans demonstrate in support of Donald Trump in front of the US embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, in February. Photograph: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delay/AP\n\n\u201cThis is persecution based on a protected characteristic \u2013 in this case, race. This is race-based persecution,\u201d he said.\n\nThe HHS office for refugee resettlement was ready to offer them support, including with housing, furniture and other household items, and expenses such as groceries, clothing and diapers, a document obtained by the Associated Press said. The document said the relocation of Afrikaners was \u201ca stated priority of the Administration\u201d.\n\nThere are around 2.7 million Afrikaners among South Africa\u2019s population of 62 million, which is more than 80% Black. They are only one part of the country\u2019s white minority.\n\nMany in South Africa are puzzled by claims that Afrikaners are persecuted and meet the requirements to be relocated as refugees.\n\nThey are part of South Africa\u2019s everyday multiracial life, with many successful business leaders and some serving in government as cabinet ministers and deputy ministers. Their language is widely spoken and recognized as an official language, and churches and other institutions reflecting Afrikaner culture hold prominence in almost every city and town.\n\nThe Trump administration has criticized South Africa on several fronts. Trump\u2019s February executive order cut all US funding to South Africa over what it said was its anti-white stance and also accused it of pursuing an anti-American foreign policy. It cited South Africa\u2019s ties with Iran and its move to lodge a genocide case against US ally Israel over the war in Gaza as examples of it taking \u201caggressive positions towards the United States\u201d.",

    "title": "White House claims China trade deal reached while Beijing hails \u2018important first steps\u2019",
    "body": "The White House has announced that a trade deal with China has been struck after two days of talks in Geneva, while Beijing has hailed \u201cimportant first steps.\u201d\n\nThe announcement on Sunday came after the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told reporters that there had been \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in talks between his team and that of the Chinese vice-premier, He Lifeng, in Geneva on defusing the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies sparked by Donald Trump\u2019s 145% tariffs.\n\nAt a news conference later on Sunday, He, the top Chinese trade official, called the talks \u201ccandid\u201d and said substantive progress had been made to reach an \u201cimportant consensus\u201d, according to China\u2019s state-run media. The two sides will issue a joint statement agreed during the talks on Monday, the vice-premier said.\n\nIn televised remarks that were posted on social media by the White House, Bessent said he would give more details on Monday, \u201cbut I can tell you that the talks were productive\u201d.\n\nThe US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, who spoke alongside Bessent, suggested more strongly that a deal had been reached.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought,\u201d Greer said.\n\n\u201cJust remember why we\u2019re here in the first place,\u201d he added. \u201cThe United States has a massive $1.2tn trade deficit, so the president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we\u2019re confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to resolve, work toward resolving that national emergency.\u201d\n\nThe two sides have agreed to set up a joint mechanism focused on \u201cregular and irregular communications related to trade and commercial issues,\u201d China\u2019s international trade representative Li Chenggang said.\n\nAsked if a communique on the talks would arrive before financial markets opened, Li replied: \u201cIf the dishes are delicious, timing is not a matter \u2026 Whenever released, it is going to be big, good news,\u201d he said.\n\nThe meeting was the first face-to-face interaction between Bessent, Greer and He since the world\u2019s two largest economies imposed tariffs well above 100% on each other\u2019s goods. Financial markets have been on edge for signs of a thaw in the trade war that has already begun to disrupt supply chains, prompt layoffs and raise wholesale prices.\n\nAlthough Bessent has said the bilateral tariffs were too high and needed to come down in a de-escalation move, he did not offer any details of reductions agreed and took no questions from reporters.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday night, Trump wrote on his social media platform that the two sides were working on \u201ca total reset \u2026 in a friendly, but constructive, manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany things discussed, much agreed to,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cWe want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!,\u201d Trump added. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, that China needs to be \u201copened\u201d to US business seemed to ignore a half century of trade between the two nations since one of his political heroes, Richard Nixon, visited China in 1972.\n\nThe US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, confirmed to CNN that the US will continue to keep \u201ca 10% baseline tariff to be in place for the foreseeable future\u201d even on imports from nations the US strikes new trade deals with.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen in all likelihood is that relationships are going to be rebooted. It looks like the Chinese are very very eager to play ball and renormalise things \u2026 they really want to rebuild a relationship that\u2019s great for both of us.\u201d\n\nLast week, Trump and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, announced a limited bilateral trade deal.\n\nHassett said the UK agreement provided a \u201creally exciting blueprint\u201d and that he had been briefed on 24 deals with other countries that are in the works. \u201cThey all look a little bit like the UK deal but each one is bespoke,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Lutnick dismissed reports of dock workers and truckers losing their jobs as a result of the tariffs.\n\n\u201cThis is just a China problem right now,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cThe rest of the world is 10% [tariffs]. So don\u2019t overdo it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrices are going to stay stable once this policy is done,\u201d Lutnick added.\n\nThe fact the talks are even happening \u201cis good news for business, and for the financial markets\u201d, Gary Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview while the talks were ongoing.\n\nBut Hufbauer cautioned he was \u201cvery sceptical that there will be any return to something like normal US-China trade relations\u201d. Even a tariff rate of 70-80% would still potentially halve bilateral trade, he said.\n\n\u201cThe devil will be in the details,\u201d said Cutler from ASPI. \u201cWithout the details, it\u2019s hard to assess whether the meeting was successful or not.\u201d\n\nReuters contributed reporting",

    "body": "Trump administration homeland security officials were responsible for starting the confrontation on Friday at a New Jersey immigration jail that led to the arrest of Newark\u2019s mayor as well as threats to detain three members of Congress, the representatives said Sunday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union.\n\nThe Democratic representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez \u2013 all of New Jersey \u2013 visited the controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center known as Delaney Hall on Friday to inspect the facility. As they waited to enter Delaney Hall, Newark\u2019s mayor, Ras Baraka, arrived \u2013 and as he left the property, he was arrested outside by Ice officials accusing him of trespassing, leading to a commotion at the entrance of the jail.\n\nThere evidently was shoving and pushing between federal immigration officials and the members of Congress, which Watson Coleman, McIver and Menendez blamed on the immigration officials.\n\nOn CNN\u2019s State of the Union, the Congress members said immigration officials had ample opportunity to deescalate the situation before someone called in and instructed masked agents to arrest Baraka.\n\n\u201cThey created that confrontation, they created that chaos,\u201d McIver said.\n\nSince the ordeal on Friday at Delaney Hall, homeland security officials have accused the Congress members of staging a \u201cbizarre political stunt\u201d there while also accusing McIver of \u201cbodyslamming\u201d authorities at the scene.\n\nMcIver rejected those allegations.\n\n\u201cI honestly do not know how to bodyslam anyone,\u201d McIver said. \u201cThere\u2019s no video that supports me bodyslamming anyone.\n\n\u201cWe were simply there to do our job \u2013 there for an oversight visit.\u201d\n\nFor their part, officials have threatened to arrest the three members of Congress in connection with Friday\u2019s commotion at Delaney Hall. Watson Coleman told CNN on Sunday that those threats stemmed from the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cdetermination to intimidate people in this country\u201d.\n\nThe Delaney Hall facility was recently reopened by Ice, as the agency continues to expand its detention network to assist in the Trump administration\u2019s aspirations to carry out mass deportations. The facility operator says it has the capacity to detain 1,000 people.\n\nDelaney Hall is owned by Geo Group, a massive, private prison company with Ice facilities throughout the US. The Trump administration in February gave a 15-year contract worth $1bn to Geo Group to operate Delaney Hall.\n\nHowever, the new contract comes amid legal challenges to Ice detention in New Jersey. Newark\u2019s municipal government recently filed a lawsuit against Geo Group claiming that the company did not have the proper permits to operate the facility.\n\nThere is also a separate legal battle playing out in a federal appellate court related to private immigration detention in the state. In 2021, Phil Murphy, the New Jersey governor, signed a law barring immigration detention in the state. Another private prison company, CoreCivic, which runs the only other immigration jail in the state, sued New Jersey\u2019s state government.\n\nCoreCivic received support from the Biden administration in its suit, and a federal judge ruled in favor of the company. The state challenged the federal judge\u2019s decision, and a federal appellate court heard arguments for the case only recently.",

    "title": "Iran and US talks upbeat despite disagreement over uranium enrichment",
    "body": "Iran and the US have ended a fourth round of talks on a surprisingly upbeat note, despite the two sides appearing far apart on the central issue of a uranium enrichment programme on Iranian soil.\n\nThe talks in Muscat, Oman lasted four hours and were described as positive by the US side. The Iranian foreign ministry said the \u201ctalks had been difficult but detailed to better understand each side\u2019s positions\u201d.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said: \u201cWe have moved away from general areas to a great extent and have gone into details. In such circumstances, negotiations have become more difficult.\u201d\n\nSpeaking before the talks started, Araghchi said Iran will not in any circumstances back down from its \u201cright\u201d to enrich uranium for energy.

    "body": "From 2h ago 09.12 CEST US and China agree 90-day pause - to cut tariffs by 115% Newsflash: the US and China have agreed to lower tariffs on each other\u2019s goods substantially for 90 days, following their negotiations last weekend. Speaking in Geneva, treasury secretary Scott Bessent says that \u201cboth sides will move their tariffs down by 115%\u201d, having agreed a 90-day pause. That\u2019s a significant de-escalation in the trade war that blew up last month. Before today, the US had lifted its tariff on China to 145% (including the 20% tariff added to tackle fentanyl imports into the US), with Beijing having retaliated with 125% tariffs on US imports. Bessent tells reporters that \u201cboth sides showed great respect\u201d during their talks, and that \u201cwe both have an interest in balanced trade\u201d. Share Updated at 09.19 CEST\n\n3m ago 10.57 CEST A spokesperson for China\u2019s ministry of commerce has said today: \u201cThis move meets the expectations of producers and consumers in both countries, as well as the interests of both nations and the common interest of the world. \u201cWe hope that the US side will, based on this meeting, continue to move forward in the same direction with China, completely correct the erroneous practice of unilateral tariff hikes, and continually strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation.\u201d Share\n\n14m ago 10.46 CEST Strategist: The USA just surrendered to China Donald Trump has \u2018blinked\u2019 in his trade war with China, says Bill Blain, market strategist at Wind Shift Capital. Blain dubs today\u2019s agreement for the US and China to cut their tariffs to just 10% is a \u201cclassic bully story\u201d, saying: Bully hits someone. Someone hits back. Bully stands down. Blain explains that Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has stepped the USA back from the brink of a trade conflict with China which it would have lost, telling clients: This morning\u2019s step down will confirm the growing global realisation Trump is a dog that barks, but only bites much smaller dogs. He threatens, he postures, he steps back from the fight every time. His repeated climb downs, and his now increasingly desperate need to be seen to be doing deals, means fewer and fewer folk are scared by him. It also raises the fundamental issue \u2013 the USA can\u2019t afford a trade war. The USA is indebted to the tune of $36 trillion. Trump is promising the big beautiful bill to cut taxes. But as DOGE\u2019s failure showed, he can\u2019t cut spending. Blain reckons the US may just have averted a catastrophic trade induced crash, but could still suffer a \u201cstagflationary shock\u201d, as the trade war will have just growth and push up prices. More here. https://t.co/3ymglO0GNK\n\nTrump has not read Sun Tzu. \u201cIn the midst of chaos there is opportunity.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump blinked. 42 days after \u201cLiberation Day\u201d China gets a 10% base tariff level, putting it on better trade terms than the EU? It was a ramble of conflicting narratives, but the\u2026 \u2014 Bill Blain (@Bill_Blain) May 12, 2025 Share\n\n26m ago 10.34 CEST The oil price has pushed higher too. US crude is up 2.2%, while benchmark Brent crude is 2% higher at $65.25/barrel, the highest in around two weeks. That suggests fears of a protracted trade war, hurting global growth, are easing. Share\n\n41m ago 10.20 CEST Analyst: De-escalation seems better than we could hope for The agreement to cut tariffs between the US and China is better than hoped, reports Neil Wilson, UK investor strategist at Saxo Markets. Stocks are soaring on Monday as the US and China have struck a trade deal after productive talks in Switzerland. We\u2019d heard overnight that the two countries had made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d on trade talks, which helped lift the mood but seemed fairly innocuous. This morning we got a bit of a surprise and a jolt higher as the de-escalation seemed better than just about anyone could hope for. There are some other measures still in place, but basically the US will cut tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from 145% for 90 days, while China will lower its tariffs on US goods to 10% from 125% for 90 days. This is buying time for a more comprehensive deal \u2013 allows for time for the process and \u2018mechanism\u2019 in the words of Treasury Secretary Bessent to take place. But he also stressed that strategic rebalancing of the global economy is still underway, although \u201cneither side want a decoupling\u201d, which is the sort of commentary the market is going to lap up. But it is not true \u2013 the US is absolutely trying to decouple. Share\n\n45m ago 10.16 CEST Pound hits four-week low as dollar rallies The dollar has rallied strongly after the US and China agreed to steep reductions in tariffs for the next 90 days. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, has jumped by 1.2% today. The pound has dropped by 1.3 cents, to a four-week low of $1.317. The euro has lost almost a cent and a half, down to $1.11. Share\n\n1h ago 10.00 CEST European stock markets jump after China and US agree to slash tariffs Stock markets across Europe are rallying strongly, as investors hail the news that the US and China have agreed a 90-day pause to their trade war. Germany\u2019s DAX index has jumped by 1.5%, amid optimism that the trade war is cooling. Automakers are among the top risers in Frankfurt, with Mercedes-Benz (+5.5%), Daimler Trucks (+5.5%) and BMW (+5.4%) all gaining. France\u2019s CAC index has risen by 1.2%. There is general relief that tariffs are being cut between the US and China, at least for the 90-day window of opportunity. Ahmad Assiri, research strategist at brokerage Pepperstone, says: Economically, this step back in tariffs is not a structural fix or a comprehensive deal. But it signals a change in tone or at the very least a political willingness to pause. Under the surface, this move seems more like an effort to buy time. It may help pave the way for more serious talks over the coming three months. Markets read this as a sign that progress is possible. Not guaranteed, and not permanent, but at least it\u2019s a step forward. London\u2019s market is lagging, though, with the FTSE 100 index only up 10 points, or 0.03%. Mining stocks are jumping in London, such as Glencore (+6.3%), and Anglo American (6.2%). But, the market is being dragged back by AstraZeneca (-4%), after Donald Trump promised to use his executive powers to cut the price of prescription drugs in America. Pharmaceutical stocks slide as Trump vows to cut prescription drug prices \u2018by 30-80%\u2019 Read more Weapons maker BAE Systems (-3.5%) has also dropped, after European leaders called for unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. 0:53 European leaders call for unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine \u2013 video Share\n\n1h ago 09.52 CEST The White House has released a joint statement outlining the agreement reached at the US-China economic and trade meeting in Geneva. It confirms that the two sides are both cutting the reciprocal tariffs on each others goods by 115 percentage points, and are \u201cmoving forward in the spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect\u201d. Share\n\n1h ago 09.48 CEST Scott Bessent and Jamieson Greer also have warm words for the way the Swiss government looked after them during their weekend of negotiations in Geneva. Bessent says Switzerland, like the UK, have \u201cmoved to the front of the queue\u201d for a trade deal (a nod to the agreement announced between Washington and London last week). The EU, though, has been \u201cmuch slower\u201d, he adds. Greer explains that the Swiss opened up the grounds of the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations fro the talks, and that \u201cmost important discussion on the most challenging issues\u201d took place \u201cunder a large, beautiful tree on a set of patio sofas\u201d. Share\n\n1h ago 09.44 CEST US trade anbassador Jamieson Greer also outlined why the Trump administration was determined to reshape global trade. Greer says the US spent decades at the World Trade Organization, and holding multilateral and bilateral negotiations, trying to get other countries to reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and to agree more reciprocal trade with the US. The promise of the WTO and the multilateral system is that everyone\u2019s tariffs were going to come down, Greer tells reporters in Geneva, adding: It turned out, the US went down significantly. There were other economies that had low tariffs as well, but retained very high non-tariff barriers. We have tried really hard to work within the system. And the net result [is] the $1.2 trillion deficit in goods, the net result is manufacturing went to China, East Asia, Mexico, etc. As such, it\u2019s not realistic to sugges the US should just have kept talking, he adds.

    "body": "UK employers laid off staff in April at a faster pace than the previous month as the combination of higher employment costs and shock waves from Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war sent boardroom confidence levels plummeting.\n\nThe human resources association, CIPD, said employer confidence levels slumped to an all-time low, prompting job cuts and a widespread hiring freeze.\n\nHigher national insurance contributions (NICs) and the rise in the national living wage, which both came into effect in April, and the uncertainty created by the US president\u2019s import duties were blamed by employers for ending signs of optimism earlier in the year.\n\nThe drop in confidence levels was matched by the fall to a record low, outside the pandemic, in the number of UK employers expecting to increase headcount in the next three months. CIPD records go back to 2014.\n\nA separate survey of small and medium-sized businesses by the business advisory firm, BDO, revealed a similar picture.\n\nThe firm said a decline in output in April by manufacturing and services firms underscored the pressure facing businesses, \u201cwith confidence levels now at their weakest point in four years, comparable to levels seen during the national lockdowns\u201d.\n\nThe chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will hope the surveys \u2013 which were completed before last week\u2019s cut in interest rates by the Bank of England and the UK trade agreements with the US and India \u2013 will show a rebound in confidence during the summer.\n\nReeves has said that growing the economy is her No 1 priority and that she needs firms to be more optimistic if they are to increase investment and expand production.\n\nHowever, the CIPD said a recovery could not be guaranteed when employers were likely to be faced with extra costs from the government\u2019s employment rights bill, which added another layer of uncertainty to an already difficult outlook.\n\nJames Cockett, senior labour market economist at the CIPD, said: \u201cThe employment rights bill is landing in a fundamentally different landscape to the one expected when it formed part of the Labour manifesto in summer of last year.\n\n\u201cIt was always going to be a huge change for employers, but they\u2019re operating in an even more complex world now. It\u2019s vital the government works closely with employers to balance the very real risk of reductions in investment in people, training and technology with their desire to reduce poor employment practice.\u201d\n\nThe CIPD\u2019s latest labour market outlook report, based on a survey of 2,000 employers, showed the rate of firms expecting to increase headcount had fallen sharply among large private sector employers, and in retail in particular.\n\nAn index of employment fell from +13 in the last quarter to +8 in the latest quarter. The balance tumbled furthest in the public sector, which fell into negative territory, from +3 to -4. In the private sector, retail companies were the worst affected.\n\nAnother survey, by the accountants KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, which represents jobs agencies, found demand for staff weakened in April in line with a steady decline over the past 18 months.\n\n\u201cThe rate of contraction quickened slightly since March, but remained softer than seen earlier in the year,\u201d it said, adding: \u201cUnderlying data pointed to similarly sharp falls in both permanent and temporary vacancies.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is practically impossible for businesses to plan and invest with so much instability.\u201d\n\nThe Bank cut interest rates by a quarter point to 4.25% last Thursday. Economists at the Bank said it was too early to judge how the increases in NICs and the national living wage would affect the jobs market.\n\nIt said many employers had signalled they would try to recoup costs through lower wage rises and higher prices rather than cuts in the level of employment.\n\nA Treasury spokesperson said the government was providing stability for businesses to encourage investment.\n\n\u201cTrade deals with India and the US show the benefits of our cool-headed diplomacy.\n\n\u201cWe have provided business rates relief, capped corporation tax, and are protecting the smallest businesses from the employer national insurance increases.

    "body": "Food retailers have seen a \u201cmassive\u201d increase in pensioner shoplifters over the last year, according to a leading store security firm, amid the rising cost of living.\n\nJohn Nussbaum, director of service for retail at Kingdom Services Group, has said his staff were seeing a \u201cdifferent sort of shoplifter now\u201d as the cost of living \u201cpushes people to something they\u2019ve never done before\u201d.\n\nKingdom, which provides services for hundreds of stores across the country, including supermarkets, convenience stores and shopping malls, has received 20 to 30 reports of shoplifting a week from across the UK involving \u201cpeople who just can\u2019t afford to buy food\u201d, Nussbaum said.\n\nHe told PA Media: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a massive increase in pensioners shoplifting, putting a jar of coffee in their bag and one in the trolley, that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nHe estimated that 5% of all those caught shoplifting by Kingdom staff on a weekly basis were aged over 50.\n\n\u201cFor us over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve got this different level of crime now. We\u2019re now experiencing something different \u2013 pensioners, people who don\u2019t normally shoplift,\u201d Nussbaum said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve had instances of mothers caught shoplifting when they\u2019re with their kids.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to seeing the organised gangs, that\u2019s the norm, but the types of people being caught now has changed.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not seen this before, and I\u2019ve been in security for 30 years. Ten years ago, five years ago, you wouldn\u2019t have seen this kind of theft. We put it down to the cost of living. People can\u2019t afford to spend \u00a310, \u00a320 on food. It\u2019s desperation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cRetailers don\u2019t tend to involve the police when they\u2019re dealing with pensioners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good publicity for a supermarket if it got out that a pensioner had been handed over to the police for shoplifting.\u201d\n\nNussbaum\u2019s comments came after it emerged last month that the number of shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales has risen to the highest level on record, according to official figures, surpassing half-a-million offences for the first time in 2024.\n\nA total of 516,971 shoplifting offences were recorded last year, a 20% increase on the 429,873 in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nRetailers say the official figures \u201cseverely underestimate\u201d the scale of the problem, which would amount to only two incidents for each shop a year.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body has pointed to a rise in shoplifting by organised gangs stealing to order.\n\nGraham Wynn, assistant director of business and regulation at the BRC, said: \u201cRetail theft is a major issue for retailers, costing over \u00a32.2bn a year and acting as a major trigger for violence and abuse against staff.\n\n\u201cWhile the causes are manifold, the rise in organised crime is a significant concern, with gangs hitting stores one after another. Sadly, such theft is not a victimless crime; it pushes up the cost for honest shoppers and damages the customer experience.\u201d\n\nRetailers claim that shops have been seen as a soft target since a 2014 law change in England and Wales under which those stealing goods worth less than \u00a3200 are usually spared any prison term.\n\nBig retailers have also been accused of contributing to the rise in crime by reducing staff numbers and using more self-service checkouts in stores to keep costs down.\n\nHowever, retailers say they have spent millions of pounds on improving security in recent years, including installing facial recognition and AI-aided cameras.\n\nThe government has set out legislation to help tackle shoplifting, including removing the \u00a3200 threshold for \u201clow-level\u201d theft. The crime and policing bill, which is working its way through parliament, will also introduce a stand-alone offence of assaulting a retail worker. The government has promised funds to tackle organised gangs involved in shop theft.\n\nNussbaum said staff were seeing \u201cterrible violence now, every day\u201d from organised gangs, with one employee punched in the face just this week and those working at a shopping centre north of London wearing stab-proof vests.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual to come across guns on site.\u201d\n\nHe supported facial-recognition technology being trialled by supermarket chain Asda at five of its Greater Manchester stores, involving customers\u2019 faces, picked up on CCTV, being scanned and compared against individuals on an internal watchlist.",

    "body": "Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons have suspended supplies from a Lincolnshire pig farm linked to abuse against pigs.\n\nSecretly filmed footage has shown farm workers at Northmoor Farm appearing to grab piglets by their hind legs and smashing them on to the hard floor \u2013 a banned method of killing known as blunt force trauma or \u201cpiglet thumping\u201d.\n\nOther harrowing footage from the farm owned by one of the UK\u2019s biggest pig meat producers, Cranswick, showed a sow being kicked and beaten with metal bars, as well as a botched killing that left an animal writhing in agony, as first reported by the Mail on Sunday.\n\nOne worker who failed to kill a sow with several shots from a bolt gun, reportedly told an undercover investigator: \u201cDon\u2019t let nobody see you doing like what we did [sic].\u201d\n\nThe footage at the farm, which houses about 6,000 pigs in cramped cages, was captured over several weeks last year by an undercover investigator for the animal rights organisation Animal Justice Project (AJP).\n\nAJP has filed a formal complaint to Trading Standards, citing multiple breaches of the Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing regulations.\n\nClaire Palmer, the founder of AJP, said the group was aiming to show \u201cthe violent realities of pig farming in Britain\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Undercover footage released today by the animal rights organisation Animal Justice Project in the Mail On Sunday aims to \u2018expose the realities of pig farming to the British public\u2019. Photograph: Animal Justice Project\n\n\u201cWe are demanding immediate enforcement of the ban on blunt force trauma and the prosecution of Cranswick. There must be an independent public inquiry into pig farming practices and regulatory failures.\u201d\n\nPiglets are regularly killed as part of the meat production process \u2013 if they are weak, sick or not growing fast enough to be profitable. However, there are strict rules about the methods used.\n\nThe use of blunt force trauma to kill piglets under 10kg was outlawed in 2022 after warnings from the UK\u2019s Animal Welfare Committee and the EU\u2019s Reference Centre for Animal Welfare. Both said the method was unreliable, inhumane, and unnecessary given available alternatives, including captive bolt guns.\n\nCranswick said the entire team at the farm had been suspended while an investigation takes place, as required by law.\n\nA Cranswick spokesperson said: \u201cThe welfare of the animals we rear is of the utmost importance and we are extremely disappointed to see the unacceptable lapse of welfare standards captured at Northmoor Farm.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Evans\u2019s pitch: a health-testing company that can make diagnoses from users\u2019 blood, urine and saliva.\n\nHaemanthus\u2019 pitch and those made by the Holmes-helmed Theranos share a few significant similarities.\n\nHolmes launched Theranos in 2003 after her health-testing tech startup received significant investment from high-profile multimillionaires. She claimed her company had developed technology to rapidly and accurately test small amounts of blood to provide diagnoses.\n\nMeanwhile, in a January patent, Haemanthus indicated it can use its technology to test sweat, urine, saliva and small amounts of blood for diagnoses. The company led by Evans, who has two children with Holmes, was incorporated in February 2024 \u2013 and it has indicated that it was set to begin running tests for animals before conducting testing on humans.\n\nTheranos\u2019s claims about its technology helped its valuation balloon, reaching its $9bn peak in 2014. But bombshell investigations from the Wall Street Journal revealed that Theranos\u2019s claims were largely false. The tests were illegitimate, providing false results.\n\nThe scandal peaked when the company was dissolved in 2018. Later that same year, Holmes and the company\u2019s president were charged with fraud. Holmes was sentenced to 11 years prison in 2022 for defrauding investors.\n\nHaemanthus\u2019 marketing materials, reviewed by the New York Times, show that the company\u2019s technology will use a laser to scan blood, saliva or urine from pets and \u201canalyze the samples on a molecular level\u201d. The technology then would require only a matter of seconds to detect illnesses, cancer or infections.\n\nAccording to the Times\u2019 report, the marketing materials say the Haemanthus\u2019 long-term goals include developing a small, wearable version of the device for humans.\n\nSeveral investors have already passed on the pitch, according to the Times report. But, while reportedly being advised by Holmes, Evans has been able to raise almost $20m from friends and other investors.\n\nEvans met Holmes in 2017 amid the fraud investigation that resulted in her imprisonment. He reportedly lives in Texas with their children while Holmes is serving time in a federal prison about two hours away.",

    "body": "Passengers flying out of London Stansted airport on Sunday morning experienced large queues, delays and some missed flights after an IT problem affected check-in, baggage and security systems.\n\nImages posted on social media showed long queues and although the issue was said to have been resolved, passengers were advised to stay in touch with their airlines as some flights faced possible delays.\n\nIn a statement published on X, the airport said: \u201cOur teams are working hard to fully restore operations following the IT issue that impacted our systems earlier this morning.\n\n\u201cWhile the issue has been resolved, some flights may still be subject to delays. We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause and advise passengers to check the status of their flights with their airlines before travelling to the airport.\n\n\u201cWe hope to have all systems fully resolved soon and will provide another update shortly.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Stansted told PA Media: \u201cAll systems have now been fully restored and no flights have been cancelled as a result of the IT issue. We are investigating the cause of the earlier issue so nothing confirmed at this stage but, for background, it looks like it was related to internet access for some systems.\u201d\n\nOne passenger who missed his Ryanair flight to Rome told the Guardian: \u201cI got there two hours before [my flight] just after 6am. My flight was at 8.05 \u2013 I didn\u2019t get there on time.\u201d\n\nHe said the customer service desk had an hour-long queue.

    "title": "MPs should not accept any murky answers from Thames Water chair on potential sale | Nils Pratley",
    "body": "Hurrah, Sir Adrian Montague, the chair of Thames Water, is scheduled to make another of his rare public appearances. On Tuesday, he will be at the environment select committee, the forum where 18 months ago he gave a strong signal that the company\u2019s financial crisis was even worse than feared.\n\nThe shareholders, in their standoff with the regulator over bills, wanted to know the business was \u201cinvestable\u201d, said Montague. Three months later those investors decided it wasn\u2019t and refused to put in another penny. That forced the current refinancing contest that has seen KKR, the US private equity group, chosen as preferred bidder at the end of March.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sir Adrian Montague. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe MPs should press Montague on three points. First, why KKR? The firm is a big grown-up investor in infrastructure projects around the world, so definitely qualifies as credible from a financial perspective, even if half the job at Thames is repairing a balance sheet wrecked originally by another set of financiers (Macquarie).\n\nBut what about the other half \u2013 actually running Europe\u2019s biggest and most troubled utility? Amazingly, neither Thames nor KKR has described out loud how the business would be managed differently, or when the suffering customers could expect to see better service and less sludge in the rivers. Thames\u2019s 2025-30 business plan was labelled \u201cinadequate\u201d by the regulator, Ofwat, in April. By when does KKR aspire to adequacy? Thames\u2019s four-paragraph announcement in March merely offered a few minimal financial details, such as haircuts for senior bondholders, that were already known.\n\nThe customer angle also matters because of the second question: why did Thames go into the final diligence stage with only one interested party?\n\nOfwat is known to have wanted two bidders in the mix at the end to provide choice and competing visions, so why did the board of Thames think only one would do? An obvious alternative would have been CK Infrastructure, which owns 75% of Northumbrian Water, one of the better-performing water firms, versus KKR\u2019s 25% and has held its stake for many more years.\n\nThere are possible explanations. Two bidders could have made the grinding process ever longer, or more expensive (this is a fee bonanza for City advisers already). Or perhaps one or both of the final two refused to go further on a non-exclusive basis.\n\nBut the board of Thames is ultimately in charge of the process. It could have set rules at the outset to require competition until the end. So could the government, the other unnaturally quiet observer to proceedings.\n\nIn the absence of explanations, you can\u2019t blame the likes of economist Sir Dieter Helm for concluding that the A-class bondholders are attempting to sell the company to the bidder \u201cmost minded to do what is in their interests\u201d \u2013 in other words, the one that will offer the smallest haircuts on them. A customer-first clean-up might impose bigger losses for bondholders.\n\nThen there is a third question that has been overlooked since KKR was selected: what are the \u201cfurther, and varying, regulatory support and accommodations\u201d that Thames said earlier in March were being insisted upon in most of the would-be bidders (there were six at that stage). The best guess is they involve some form of deal, or understanding, that wraps up Thames\u2019s potential outstanding fines.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But shouldn\u2019t we also be told what sort of regulatory compromises are being contemplated to produce the politically expedient outcome of keeping Thames out of special administration, AKA temporary nationalisation? Aren\u2019t \u201cregulatory accommodations\u201d just a demand for special treatment?\n\nThe point is that control of a regulated company with \u00a320bn of assets and 16 million customers looks likely to change hands with extraordinary little outside scrutiny. Ofwat\u2019s wish for two bidders has been ignored. The Treasury, the Guardian reported, has ratcheted up the pressure to get a deal done by telling the environment department it would have to meet the budget-busting upfront costs of special administration, even if sums could be recouped later. And Thames\u2019s public statements seem designed to shed as little light as possible.\n\nMontague\u2019s appearance may be the select committee\u2019s last chance to achieve some basic transparency.

    "title": "For Silicon Valley, AI isn\u2019t just about replacing some jobs. It\u2019s about replacing all of them | Ed Newton-Rex",
    "body": "I recently found myself at a dinner in an upstairs room at a restaurant in San Francisco hosted by a venture capital firm. The after-dinner speaker was a tech veteran who, having sold his AI company for hundreds of millions of dollars, has now turned his hand to investing. He had a simple message for the assembled startup founders: the money you can make in AI isn\u2019t limited to the paltry market sizes of previous technology waves. You can replace the world\u2019s workers \u2013 which means you can capture their salaries. All of them.\n\nReplacing all human labour with AI sounds like the stuff of science fiction. But it is the explicit aim of a growing number of the tech elite \u2013 and these are people who lack neither drive nor resources, who have deep pockets and even deeper determination. If they say they want to automate all labour, we should take them at their word.\n\nThis is generally an aim that\u2019s only admitted to behind closed doors, for obvious reasons. There\u2019s little that will summon the pitchforks quicker than telling people you\u2019re trying to take away their jobs. But a company called Mechanize last month bucked the trend and said the quiet part out loud. Their vision is \u201cthe full automation of the economy\u201d, a vision they\u2019ve convinced some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley to fund, including Google\u2019s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, and popular podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.\n\nIs automating all jobs really feasible? Elon Musk certainly thinks so. The rise of AI and robotics will mean \u201cprobably none of us will have a job\u201d, he said last year. Bill Gates thinks humans soon won\u2019t be needed for \u201cmost things\u201d. Massive labour replacement has also been predicted by godfather of AI Geoffrey Hinton and billionaire investor Vinod Khosla. These are hardly fringe voices that have no idea what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nSome careers are obviously safe from robot takeover. Taylor Swift is not in danger. Nor is Harry Kane. Nor, for that matter, is Keir Starmer, or the as-yet-unnamed next archbishop of Canterbury. Famous artist, sportsperson, politician, priest \u2013 perhaps the four jobs that are the most resistant to automation. Unfortunately they\u2019re not open to all of us.\n\nToday\u2019s technology cannot replace all human labour. AI makes mistakes. Robots lack coordination, dexterity, versatility. So that\u2019s something. But there is lots that cutting-edge technology can already do. And there are good reasons to think it will continue to improve \u2013 fast.\n\nGPT-4, one of OpenAI\u2019s large language models, was already scoring in the top 10% on the bar exam back in 2023. Their more recent models are better at coding than their own chief scientist. Freelance writing jobs plummeted when ChatGPT was released; the same happened to graphic design jobs with the arrival of AI image generators. Driverless cars are everywhere in San Francisco. As Sam Altman himself said: \u201cJobs are definitely going to go away, full stop.\u201d\n\nWhile AI grabs most of the headlines, robots are advancing rapidly too. And where AI threatens white-collar jobs, robots target physical labour. One type of humanoid robot is already being tested in BMW factories; another managed to master more than 100 tasks that would usually be done by human store workers. Companies plan to start testing robots in the home this year. The Silicon Valley vision for the labour market is remarkably simple: AI does the thinking, robots do the doing. What place do humans have in this arrangement?\n\nUp until very recently, AI researchers thought that artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2013 that is, AI that can perform essentially all cognitive tasks at human level \u2013 was a long way off. Not any more. Demis Hassabis, the head of Google DeepMind, now thinks \u201cit\u2019s coming very soon\u201d \u2013 less than five to 10 years wouldn\u2019t surprise him.\n\nOf course these predictions may be wrong. Perhaps we\u2019re headed for another AI winter; perhaps the chatbots will stop improving, the robots will keep falling over, the funding will move on to the next big thing in tech. I don\u2019t think so, but it\u2019s possible. But that\u2019s not the point. The question here isn\u2019t whether the legions of tech CEOs and billions of dollars of funding being poured into near-total labour automation will achieve what they\u2019re trying to achieve. The question is why they\u2019re trying to achieve it at all, and how the rest of us feel about it.\n\nThe generous answer is that they genuinely believe a post-labour economy will mean huge economic growth and vastly improved global living standards. The obvious question is what, historically speaking, suggests that the benefits of this growth would be distributed evenly.\n\nThe less generous answer is that it\u2019s about what it\u2019s always about: money. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen once famously said: \u201cSoftware is eating the world.\u201d Up until now there\u2019s only been so much it could eat. Whatever software you built, you still needed people to do most of the world\u2019s work, with the labour market itself tantalisingly out of reach for ambitious tech execs. But now Silicon Valley sees an opening. A chance to own the entire means of production. And it wouldn\u2019t be Silicon Valley if it didn\u2019t try to seize that chance.",

    "title": "UK interest rate cut may not be enough to improve voters\u2019 dim view of the government | Heather Stewart",
    "body": "The return of spring weather across much of the UK last week brought some rare glimmers of sunshine for the UK\u2019s struggling economy too \u2013 including a confidence-boosting interest rate cut, with hopes of more to come.\n\nAnd as Keir Starmer hopes to seal a closer trading relationship with the EU, he is urging voters to look \u201cforward, not back\u201d.\n\nYet even if some consumers start to feel the clouds are parting, it is unlikely to come soon enough to improve voters\u2019 dim view of the government, as displayed in the local elections. That may take a more radical rethink.\n\nThe Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision on Thursday was welcome, though less than wholehearted, with two of the monetary policy committee\u2019s (MPC) nine members preferring no change (though another two wanted a bumper half-point cut).\n\nThe committee\u2019s more cautious members appear to have been restrained by fears of the dreaded second-round effects. These can translate a short-term inflationary surge, such as the one now coming our way as a result of rising utility bills, into a longer-lasting crisis.\n\nWorkers respond to price rises by bidding up their wages, the theory goes. That means higher labour costs for firms, which then pass these on to consumers in the form of higher prices \u2013 and so it goes on.\n\nYet much of the MPC\u2019s narrative last week seemed to cut against this picture of the world. For one thing, a wave of inflation-busting pay rises seems a stretch in the current labour market, which has now been slowing for months. Neither does the chancellor seem likely to sign off on a big increase for public sector workers.\n\nConsumers scarred by the savage run-up in bills in 2022 and 2023, may well have high inflation expectations, then, but it seems questionable whether they will be able to translate them into chunky pay rises.\n\nSecondly, while Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are likely to be painfully inflationary for American consumers, the impact on the UK, the Bank judges, will be modestly slower growth, and weaker inflation.\n\nThe latter is because of lower global oil prices, already flowing through to the UK\u2019s petrol pumps; and the likelihood that some cheap Chinese goods previously destined for the US will find their way here.\n\nIn other words, while the Bank is nervous about a fresh wave of inflation existence later in the year, there are reasons to think that will not happen.\n\nIt may take some months for the fog to clear, but by the summer, the worst fears of the MPC hawks may have lifted, opening the way for the Bank to respond to flatlining growth in the standard way, with a run of quickfire rate cuts \u2013 a \u201cdovish pivot\u201d, as analysts Oxford Economics put it.\n\nDespite the bleak global backdrop it seems just possible that by the time Rachel Reeves delivers her second budget, a combination of lower mortgage costs, cheaper petrol and bargain Chinese imports may have helped to lighten the consumer mood.\n\nMeanwhile, investor confidence, another magic ingredient for recovery, may be helped at the margin by the UK-India trade deal announced last week; and the conclusion of negotiations with Trump, which resulted in swingeing tariffs on cars and steel being lifted.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves is right to say her inheritance from the Tories was grim. She increased taxes by a stonking \u00a330bn in last year\u2019s budget, to fund public services, and has flexed the fiscal rules to allow a planned \u00a3100bn in additional public investment. Comparisons with George Osborne are clearly wide of the mark.\n\nBut the determination to demonstrate Labour\u2019s seriousness \u2013 to voters and the markets \u2013 has resulted in some deeply unpopular policies, including the welfare reforms that ended up being the centrepiece of her spring statement, and the cut to winter fuel allowance.\n\nWell-sourced reports that the winter fuel cut could be partially reversed, were ultimately knocked down by Downing Street last week, but the fact the idea was being floated underlines how much pressure Reeves is under.\n\nMPs campaigning in the local elections reported winter fuel and personal independence payments coming up repeatedly as reasons for voters\u2019 disillusionment with Labour, which had promised them \u201cchange\u201d.\n\nEven if there is no softening of either of these controversial policies, then, it is hard to imagine the political mood would now allow Reeves to come back in the autumn with deep cuts if, as the gloomy National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggested last week, her fiscal plans are way off course.\n\nUltimately, even if the Bank sweeps in with more growth-boosting rate cuts, it may be Labour\u2019s tax pledges, with which Reeves is so closely associated, that have to give. She and her team face an anxious few months ahead.",
    "summary": "The return of spring weather across much of the UK last week brought some rare glimmers of sunshine for the UK\u2019s struggling economy too \u2013 including a confidence-boosting interest rate cut, with hopes of more to come.\nAnd as Keir Starmer hopes to seal a closer trading relationship with the EU, he is urging voters to look \u201cforward, not back\u201d.\nYet even if some consumers start to feel the clouds are parting, it is unlikely to come soon enough to improve voters\u2019 dim view of the government, as displayed in the local elections.\nThe committee\u2019s more cautious members appear to have been restrained by fears of the dreaded second-round effects.\nYet much of the MPC\u2019s narrative last week seemed to cut against this picture of the world.",

    "title": "Trump will destroy world trade, but democracies can defend themselves \u2013 and each other | Anders Fogh Rasmussen",
    "body": "The postwar global economic order, with the United States at its centre, has created more prosperity than any other period in human history. Yet as Donald Trump takes a sledgehammer to that economic order, America\u2019s democratic allies face a choice. We can accept the new cost of doing business with the US. We can follow the US down a path of mutually assured economic destruction with an ever-escalating trade war. Or we can find new avenues to keep free trade alive.\n\nMy proposition? I believe we need a new platform for economic cooperation between the world\u2019s seven leading democracies. Call it the \u201cDemocratic 7\u201d, or \u201cD7\u201d. The EU, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea represent roughly 25% of global GDP and account for about 35% of global trade volume. Together, these democracies can help to shield each other from the threats of economic nationalism and coercion \u2013 while also championing democracy, the rule of law, and market economics.\n\nThe building blocks for this are already in place. The D7 would draw on an existing web of bilateral and regional trade agreements and could serve as an incentive to sign new ones. Already, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, otherwise known as the CPTPP, includes Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. The EU maintains comprehensive agreements with Japan, South Korea and Canada. An outstanding agreement between the EU and Australia could be put back on track, and the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, recently stressed an improvement in the UK-EU trading relationship as \u201cimperative\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of a D7 economic alliance would be the economic equivalent of Nato\u2019s foundational principle, article 5, which holds that an attack on one is an attack on all. When economic powers threaten critical supply chains, engage in economic blackmail, or use access to their markets as leverage, they\u2019re counting on isolating vulnerable countries. After Canada honoured its extradition treaty with the US and detained a Huawei executive, for example, Canadian exports of pork and canola were banned from China. Australia\u2019s trade with its Pacific neighbour was frozen after Canberra suggested an inquiry into the origins of the Covid pandemic, and South Korean companies have paid the price for decisions made in Seoul that displeased Beijing.\n\nThe D7\u2019s article 5 would ensure that coercion against one D7 member triggers an immediate, proportional response from all. This would fundamentally alter the calculus of those who wield their economic might as a weapon. The D7\u2019s mandate could also extend beyond defensive measures. It could create new frameworks for secure supply chains in critical sectors like semiconductors, rare earth minerals, medical supplies and green technologies. When one member faces shortages, others could provide priority access. Joint investment in production could ensure resilience against future disruptions of the kind we saw during the pandemic, and following Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTogether, D7 members could build a coherent, streamlined trading zone: reducing tariffs, removing bureaucratic hurdles, and establishing new standards based on shared values. Doing so would enhance our collective negotiating power when dealing with the US and China. When setting collective standards on emerging technologies like AI, for example, a D7\u2019s collective economic weight would help prevent global rules being dictated by autocrats or tech oligarchs.\n\nBut no alliance is made stronger by becoming a closed club. While seven could serve as a starting point, the door should remain open to those who share these democratic values and are willing to support rules-based trade and prevent economic coercion, be they from Asia, Africa, Latin America, or elsewhere.\n\nTrue, a D7 would be an undoubtedly complex undertaking. Any number of politicians and vested interests could raise concerns about agricultural policies or regulatory approaches. Europe can seldom find unanimity, and there is also the fact of Brexit to contend with. But the global economic order that has benefited the world\u2019s democracies is today facing an existential threat. If this order continues to fragment, democracies will be left at the whims of Trump and Xi Jinping. That\u2019s why democracies need to stand together. Even while we grapple with this painful new reality, we must not forget: we still maintain the power to shape it.",

    "title": "The insidious doublespeak of Trump\u2019s freedom of \u2018choice\u2019",
    "body": "View image in fullscreen Illustration: Ben Hickey/The Guardian\n\nFreedom of choice is a venerable American value. Donald Trump\u2019s attachment to it is, however, highly selective.\n\nOver the first four months of his administration, Trump has been eagerly promoting the expansion of choice in our economic lives. That\u2019s especially the case when it comes to our role as consumers. Think kitchens, baths and automobiles; the stated goal every time he talks about commodities has been increasing the number of options so we can select and buy what we like best \u2013 environmental effects notwithstanding. Even his tariffs are only supposed to bring temporary pain, as in emptier toy shelves, before American-made abundance starts to rule the day once again.\n\nIn our political lives, though, it\u2019s a different story: the president and his administration have been busy instituting new restrictions on both the possibilities on offer and the picking itself. As citizens rather than consumers, we\u2019ve been explicitly told our options are permanently contracting to \u201csave our country\u201d. No longer, for example, should it be possible to share \u201cradical, anti-American ideologies\u201d in our classrooms or decide how we want to be addressed.\n\nAs a result, our economic and political existences are now on rapidly diverging paths \u2013 with questions about what choice is good for, where it counts, and who is in charge of the menu at the core. What we are seeing is the emergence of a new kind of authoritarianism that still pays homage to libertarianism, but only in the realm of consumer choice.\n\nA choice explosion\n\nThere is a long backstory here. Ordinary people, wherever they found themselves in the world, once had many fewer choices to make than we typically do today \u2013 and they didn\u2019t attach as much meaning to the act of choosing either. One of the things that made one free prior to the modern era was not having to make a lot of decisions about where to live, how to make money, whom to marry, what to own or which political philosophy to back.\n\nBut over the last two and a half centuries, the range of both options and opportunities for choice-making \u2013 from determining what to eat for lunch to deciding with whom to spend one\u2019s days and nights \u2013 has increased exponentially. The categories of people given the formal power to exercise this kind of self-determination have expanded, too, even as the possibility of being able to use this power has remained wildly unevenly distributed. This isn\u2019t just an American story either. Something similar has happened in countries around the globe that consider themselves capitalist democracies.\n\nFrom billboards to human rights decrees and constitutions, choice has come to stand for freedom itself\n\nThe roots of this choice explosion extend all the way to the 17th and 18th centuries. The expansion of global commerce in the first age of empire is one major source. That\u2019s when advertisements and displays of new products in western European cities made use of increasing variety in goods, such as colored and patterned fabrics from south Asia, to develop the idea of consumer choice. The Reformation is another point of origin insofar as it shattered the unity of European Christendom, eventually putting religious and then intellectual choice on the table as well.\n\nShopkeepers, auctioneers, itinerant preachers and printers helped lead the way, alongside philosophers and novelists. We might think of all of those figures as early versions of what behavioral economists today call \u201cchoice architects\u201d: people whose job is to construct the menus of options and, often without calling much attention to themselves, establish the rules for the game of selection. Their power, even when limited, stemmed from creating the conditions for the flourishing of what we have come to experience as the \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d.\n\nBut it was the late 19th and 20th centuries that truly sped the process along, turning choice-making into a habitual part of life. Along with more to choose with every passing year came a mass movement towards imagining ones\u2019 life story as constructed out of free choices made in our free time. Democracies were a final piece of the puzzle. Though the era of the American and French Revolutions had already established elections as vital to self-rule, after about 1870, one nation after another began instituting and standardizing technologies like the secret ballot that brought political determinations into line with a range of other individualized, preference-based activities.\n\nView image in fullscreen An undated photo of a cafeteria vending machine containing cake and pie desserts. Photograph: H Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock\n\nToday \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 we shop for goods, entertainments, courses of study and vacations. We pick our friends, lovers and life partners. We vote for our favorite candidates. We select where we want to live, what we want to do for a profession (though, exceptionally, not what we do when we are actually on the job), whether to have children, and even insurance plans to hedge our bets when facing situations beyond our control. Whole sciences explain how and why we choose what we do and with what consequences. The promise is that, with our own choices, we can get what we personally prefer. And we can be the autonomous people that we yearn to be.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that the proliferation of choice has been an unmitigated boon for humanity, as critics have pointed out repeatedly along the way. Voices on the right of the political spectrum have long bemoaned the way an emphasis on choice upends tradition, especially in the moral sphere \u2013 making almost every decision into a form of marketplace transaction in which individual taste rules the day. Many on the left have agreed to an extent, suggesting that modeling life on a shop window or bazaar \u2013 in which a product, human or otherwise, exists for every desire \u2013 leads to the obfuscation of deep inequalities of opportunity and the neglect of our obligations to each other along with the planet itself. They have also complained (quite rightly) that choice is always a lot less free, in the sense of unconstrained, than we might think.\n\nStill, \u201cchoice\u201d has long been a favorite word on both sides of the aisle in US politics (and not least when the issue is contentious, like the future of healthcare). That helps explain why \u201cthe right to choose\u201d seemed like a promising slogan in the early 1970s to abortion rights defenders who were eager to find an uncontroversial framing device for their advocacy work in the aftermath of Roe v Wade. Who could object to simply having more choices, especially when the promise was that one could pick in accord with one\u2019s personal values and desires? From billboards to human rights decrees and constitutions, choice has come to stand for freedom itself. It is even a marker now on global happiness indexes; more of one means more of the other. Ever since the end of the second world war, this assumption has made our economic and political lives seem intrinsically linked.\n\nA shrinking political menu\n\nBut that isn\u2019t where we are now. Despite its sporadic and often misleading appeal to the language of choice, the Trump administration is intent on undoing this historical pact between consumer and political choice and thus of a key element of the liberal paradigm. While expanding consumer options, or at least giving the impression this is the plan, this presidency is working hard to limit options in almost all other spheres.\n\nSomething similar is being attempted by many of Trump\u2019s counterparts in other increasingly illiberal capitalist democracies, from Hungary to India, around the globe. (And perhaps this is not just a story about capitalist democracies \u2013 even China could now be understood as a nation in thrall to consumer choice at the expense of other forms of freedom.) But this disjunction is becoming especially pronounced in the US, where choice is continuing its ascent in one sphere (albeit within the constraints of an ever-changing policy on tariffs), just as it is being rapidly circumscribed, in both practice and lingo, in most others.\n\nApart from the arena of consumption, Trump is little invested in expanding individual, preference-based selection making\n\nWhen it comes to freedom of choice for consumers, which has long been offered up as the flip side of deregulation for industries, Trump and his minions are all in \u2013 at least rhetorically. They borrow cliches that are recognizable from 18th-century sales pitches promising \u201cthe greatest choices\u201d in fabrics all the way to Milton and Rose Friedman\u2019s bestselling 1980 book and TV series, Free to Choose. The argument is as much about personal liberty as economic benefit.\n\nRight off the bat, in his inaugural address this January, Trump promised Americans that he was ending the electric vehicle mandate, as well as the rest of Joe Biden\u2019s environmental initiatives, not just to save the auto industry but also so \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to buy the car of your choice.\u201d Consecutive executive orders have extended that same logic to appliances, lightbulbs, plumbing and even K-12 education. Undoing regulations that save water and energy and reduce global warming will \u201csafeguard the American people\u2019s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances\u201d. Getting rid of \u201cfederal meddling\u201d will also restore \u201cshower freedom\u201d, which depends upon Americans being \u201cfree to choose their showerheads\u201d. As for schools, in which the right has long supported a voucher system so that families can select the educational approach they prefer in a marketplace that includes religious and for-profit along with public options, the executive order states: \u201cPres. Trump will provide every available opportunity for parents to enrich the education of their children through individual choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking America Great Again\u201d thus turns out to be largely a promise about an odd kind of consumer paradise. It is not competitive pricing and affordability Trump is after. Nor is it safer or improved goods that would lead to better health and welfare. Rather, just having more options from which to pick is the new holy grail, whether we are talking about dishwashers or elementary schools. Never mind that high tariffs and protectionism will likely make everything more expensive or constrict the field of choice itself at least for a while, forcing parents to buy, in Trump\u2019s words, \u201ctwo dolls instead of 30\u201d. In fact, under pressure from the business wing of his party, he\u2019s already backed away from the most dramatic of these measures. In the Maga utopia, the deregulation of businesses, especially when it comes to abandoning rules about environmental concerns or racial equity or even corrupt practices, ultimately creates a cornucopia of possibilities for purchasers, who are going to be newly empowered to vote with their wallets for whatever products they like best. Consumer choice is recast as a fundamental right and freedom.\n\nYet apart from the arena of consumption, Trump is little invested in expanding individual, preference-based selection making. On the contrary, in the political sphere, the president seems to be looking to move the US in precisely the opposite direction. Even with falling approval ratings, he is still counting on considerable popular support for a vision of the world in which Amazon offers up thousands of potential possibilities, from movies to toasters, for our pleasure, but nativist chauvinism and a limited repertoire of Christian values curtail options and opportunities for choice in most other domains. He and his fans view it as the function of a strong executive to make both our reality.\n\nView image in fullscreen Abortion rights activists protest at the federal courthouse plaza after the overturning of Roe v Wade by the US supreme court, in Austin, Texas, on 24 June 2022. Photograph: Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to things that don\u2019t take the form of sellable commodities, the parallel framing around freedom as choice has all but disappeared from the vocabulary of this administration. It\u2019s also fast disappearing from policy itself, as representatives of Trump\u2019s brand of Republicanism challenge both the traditional understandings of executive power and constitutional protections around civil and political rights. The latter are precisely those rights outside the consumer sphere \u2013 such as religious rights, marriage rights, and rights to determine political representatives \u2013 that have been redefined as matters of choice ever since the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the aftermath of the second world war. This isn\u2019t how they are being defined by the US government now.\n\nThe ability to make one\u2019s own determinations in ideas, expression and ideology, despite some early Trump administration bromides about the importance of freedom of speech, is on the chopping block as a result of yet another set of executive orders and agency moves. That includes bans, wherever federal dollars or other forms of federal patronage are at stake, on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, the investigation of the climate crisis, the expression of pro-Palestinian sentiments, or the promotion of history, art or literature that runs counter to so-called \u201cpatriotic\u201d education, among other topics. Such menu limitations are already being felt from classrooms and laboratories to federal agencies and cultural institutions, even as court challenges are growing in number. Restrictions on people\u2019s choice of residency or travel are also more visible by the day, not least in the actions of Ice. Let\u2019s not forget, either, new limits on options in our sexual and familial lives \u2013 such as efforts to further reduce abortion rights at the federal level and refusals to allow people to determine their own identities \u2013 especially when it comes to gender.\n\nThen there are efforts to curtail voting itself, which is the primary form of political choice. Kamala Harris tried during her brief presidential campaign last year to tie support for voting rights to abortion rights as similarly threatened \u201cfundamental freedoms\u201d, though the idea never gained much traction. This administration sees things differently.\n\nElections themselves are not likely to disappear entirely any time soon; almost every nation state in the world, no matter how dictatorial, continues to enable some form of voting by citizens. That\u2019s because voting is so closely associated today with the idea that, in any legitimate state, the people\u2019s interests need representation. Trump, moreover, likes to claim a popular mandate for his actions, even as he sometimes flirts with the idea that he is a \u201cking\u201d who is unbeholden to anyone but himself.\n\nStill, the Trump administration is already eagerly suggesting that elections won\u2019t be happening in the same way as they once did, after long insisting that any Trump defeat would be a sure sign of election fraud, thus delegitimizing in advance all but one predetermined result. Indeed, as a slate of proposed new rules designed to actually discourage voting in future federal elections makes clear, much of his administration\u2019s energy in these first months has gone into trying to find new ways to limit who has access to political or intellectual or even cultural choices; to take off the table or reduce rather than increase the set of options available; and to narrow the parameters within which choices can be made and registered. What other purpose could, say, new restrictions on the due dates for mail-in ballots in federal elections serve?\n\nEven the study of choice-making, one of the great developments of 20th-century social science including psychology and economics, is now being reduced by every means possible, from cuts to whole research-funding programs to the blockage of grants for projects making use of certain prohibited words.\n\nChoice architect in chief\n\nWhat Trump is doing is not so much abandoning the idea or practice of choice as making himself our nation\u2019s premier \u201cchoice architect\u201d. And he\u2019s doing it \u2013 at the expense of both the other branches of government and much of the private sector \u2013 as part and parcel of the expansion of executive power. That is, he is using the authority of his position to grant the rest of us sets of approved options, from ideas to identities, but also continually reminding us that it is he, as the nation\u2019s chief executive, who determines who gets to choose and how and when and where. Even threats of high tariffs are meant as leverage \u2013 pressure tools in a competitive environment, so that the president can tilt the field the way he likes and remake the set of options on behalf of the US consumer. (Artificial intelligence will surely help.)\n\nThis is a new, 21st-century form of authoritarianism marked by an enduring quasi-libertarian streak when it comes to consumption rather than citizenship. Of course, the freedom of the shopper has never been total freedom. It has always been shaped and bounded by multiple forces, from the interests of business owners and for-profit taste makers to the \u201cnudges\u201d characteristic of anonymous, technocratic policy making, such as using incentives to get people to willingly choose to save more for retirement. But over the last 75 years, much of this choice architecture has become both ubiquitous and invisible, with the promise that personal choice meant personal liberty and that freedom in one sphere would be matched by a similar form of freedom in another.\n\nThe age of choice isn\u2019t fully going away any time in the near future. It is both too entrenched and too profitable. But in a sharp break from much of recent history, our political and economic lives seem to be heading in opposite directions: investment in consumer choice (even if tempered for now by tariffs) is expanding in the Trump era in part as cover for the fact that political choice, along with choice in how to think and live, is on a steep decline.\n\nSophia Rosenfeld is Annenberg professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania and author of The Age of Choice: A History of Freedom in Modern Life (2025).",
    "summary": "What we are seeing is the emergence of a new kind of authoritarianism that still pays homage to libertarianism, but only in the realm of consumer choice.\nFrom billboards to human rights decrees and constitutions, choice has come to stand for freedom itselfThe roots of this choice explosion extend all the way to the 17th and 18th centuries.\nConsumer choice is recast as a fundamental right and freedom.\nThen there are efforts to curtail voting itself, which is the primary form of political choice.\nChoice architect in chiefWhat Trump is doing is not so much abandoning the idea or practice of choice as making himself our nation\u2019s premier \u201cchoice architect\u201d.",

There was no indication of this when I made the purchase.\n\nSince then I have been trying to find a resolution with its customer support team and they have said the tickets will become transferable nearer the time.\n\nHowever, this is quite impractical since my grandson would need to wait until then to arrange travel from Dundee and book accommodation.\n\nI believe Ticketmaster is ignoring my consumer rights and have told them so. It suggested I contact the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers, which I did but it rejected my complaint.\n\nPC, Stonehaven\n\nThe ticket-buying process is unrecognisable these days, not least because of the might of Ticketmaster, which is behind about 70% of concert tickets sales globally. In this new world it is usually e-tickets changing hands and it is becoming essential to own a smartphone if you want to buy entrance to an event.\n\nYou were frustrated to discover it was not possible to transfer the tickets straight away but if paper ones were being issued perhaps they might not have arrived by now either as the festival takes place in late August.\n\nThese days ticket distribution is far more tightly controlled in large part to make things hard for touts, who were buying up tickets and selling them on. A growing number of promoters for in-demand events issue tickets very late in the day to stop them ending up on resale sites.\n\nConsumers can transfer tickets bought on Ticketmaster for most events but some have their own rules and restrictions. For example, the option may not be available if the artist or venue has asked for it to be turned off.\n\nFor Leeds, the transfer window is determined by the organiser, Festival Republic, not Ticketmaster and has still not opened yet. When it becomes available all ticket holders will be notified via email.\n\nTicketmaster had been in touch to reassure you that it will then be possible to transfer the tickets to your grandson but you remain dissatisfied with the whole experience.\n\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write to Consumer Champions, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU. Please include a daytime phone number.

    "body": "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?\n\n20 December 2024 Share Save Mina Al-Lami \u2022 Minalami Chief jihadist media specialist, BBC Monitoring Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nLast week, while touring Damascus, Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa (formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) was approached by a young woman who asked for a photo with him. He gently requested that she cover her hair before taking the picture. The incident quickly sparked heated debate across Arabic social and mainstream media. What happened may have been small but it was telling because it encapsulated the tightrope that Syria's new rulers Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - who are designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, EU and UK - must walk. On one side is the diverse, and, in some cases more liberal, Syrian population, along with the international community, whose acceptance is crucial for HTS's survival and legitimacy. To them, the hair covering incident offered a troubling glimpse into Syria's potential future under HTS, expressing fears that conservative policies could eventually mandate the veil for all women. On the other side, Islamist hardliners criticised al-Sharaa for taking the photo at all, describing the woman as a \"mutabarijah\" - a term for a woman perceived to dress immodestly or wear makeup - and insisting his action violated religious rules. These hardliners hold significant sway over militant factions and could rally opposition within al-Sharaa's own Islamist base. HTS faces the challenge of attempting to reconcile these competing demands - balancing the expectations of the international community and the liberal parts of Syria's population with the demands of the hardline base. Both sides are closely scrutinising HTS's every statement and action.\n\nGetty Images Ahmed al-Sharaa (formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani)\n\nThe group's ability to navigate these tensions will be critical to maintaining control and pursuing its political ambitions. In his messages, he has focused on coexistence within Syria's diverse society, granted amnesty to former military conscripts, prohibited acts of vigilante revenge against ex-government personnel and loyalists, and adopted neutral and at times conciliatory language when addressing traditional adversaries, including Israel, the US, Iran and Russia. His statements have been deliberately devoid of inflammatory rhetoric or threats, instead centring on themes of reconciliation, stability, and reconstruction, in a clear effort to neutralise opposition and push for the removal of HTS and al-Sharaa himself from international terror lists.\n\nSignificant unease\n\nIt is still unclear whether al-Sharaa's flexible approach represents a genuine ideological shift or a calculated strategy aimed at winning approval and consolidating power before potentially implementing a stricter and more religiously conservative agenda. But already his more progressive moves are sparking significant unease among hardliners in Syria, who insist on an Islamist government rooted in a strict and distinctive Sunni identity. While Sunni Arabs are the dominant ethnic and religious group in Syria, the country is notably diverse, with a range of minority groups including Shia Alawites, of which the ousted president Bashar al-Assad is a member, Kurds, Christians, Druze, Turkmen and Ismailis, in addition to other small groups.\n\nReuters Crowds celebrated in Umayyad Square after the removal of Bashar al-Assad\n\nEven if HTS leadership is sincere in its push for change, the diverse range of Islamist and jihadist factions deeply entrenched in Syria - many of which played key roles in the recent offensive - are unlikely to tolerate anything short of a strict Islamist system. Should HTS deviate from such a path, these factions would likely be prepared to resort to armed resistance to enforce their vision. However this is not a new challenge for HTS.\n\nFrom IS to al-Qaeda to HTS\n\nFor a decade the group, formerly known as al-Nusra Front and with roots in transnational jihadist movements, has been evolving. HTS transitioned from being a covert offshoot of the ultra-hardline IS around 2011 and 2012, to being affiliated to the relatively more flexible al-Qaeda the following year, and by 2016 to an independent faction. It consolidated its control of Idlib province in north-west Syria in 2017, running a civilian \"government\" in the area purportedly with no lasting jihadist connections or ambitions. This evolution reflects al-Sharaa's strategic vision and likely incorporates elements of opportunism and pragmatism aimed at ensuring the group's acceptance and long-term survival. HTS's strategy of signalling that it poses no external threat has already borne fruit.\n\nReuters Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) became an independent faction in 2016\n\nWhile its former jihadist partners, al-Qaeda and IS, were heavily targeted in Syria by the US-led coalition - resulting in the routine assassination of their leaders, often in Idlib itself - al-Sharaa has operated with relative freedom. Despite a $10m (\u00a37.8m) US bounty on his head, he has been able to frequently appear publicly, attending events and engaging with the population, much like a statesman. However, al-Sharaa's jihadist critics accuse him of being a manipulative politician, willing to compromise on key ideological principles to advance his own career and secure political gains for HTS, at the expense of other militant groups operating in the country.\n\nHow rebels won hearts and minds\n\nHTS solidified its authority in Idlib through a dual strategy: winning the hearts and minds of local populations through offering some form of stability, while using force to stamp out or co-opt rivals and even former allies. The group moved away from distinctive jihadist rhetoric, fighting for religion, and the establishment of Islamic rule (Sharia) in Syria, as part of a wider interconnected global project. Instead, they adopted a more \"revolutionary\" and nationalist narrative, focusing on the singular goal of toppling Syria's president Bashar al-Assad and \"liberating\" Syria.\n\nReuters Before the HTS-led rebel offensive, the group faced widespread anti-HTS protests\n\nThe civilian front established by HTS in 2017 to administer Idlib was called the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG). The aim was to demonstrate HTS's governance capabilities, and bolster its legitimacy. This move was likely also aimed at alleviating fears about militants running a province, seeking to distance itself from the brutal image associated with IS's rule over territories in Syria and Iraq. The SSG operated as a mini-state, complete with a prime minister, ministries and local departments managing key sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, all while adhering to a religious council guided by Sharia (Islamic law). It also established professional-looking military and police academies, frequently showcasing their graduation ceremonies and organising military parades, typically attended by al-Sharaa. The SSG frequently showcased its achievements in reconstruction and service provision. It often contrasted these efforts with the dire conditions and rampant corruption in areas controlled by the Syrian government or rival rebel groups. Al-Sharaa even twice attended Idlib's annual book fair, giving speeches. But HTS faced significant challenges in Idlib, and its rule was far from smooth. Prior to the 27 November HTS-led rebel offensive, the group was dogged by anti-HTS protests, particularly targeting al-Sharaa's leadership. Protesters accused HTS of suppressing dissent through forced disappearances and imprisonment of opponents and critics.\n\nEPA Syrian rebel fighters celebrated in Hama after the Syrian military withdrew its troops\n\nThe group also faced criticism for allegedly colluding with foreign powers to undermine \"the jihad\" in Syria. In 2023, it was further rocked by a scandal involving spies within its top leadership, and was accused by hardliners of deliberately avoiding meaningful combat against government forces to please unnamed foreign backers. During such protests, al-Sharaa was frequently likened to Assad, while HTS's security apparatus was compared to the \"Shabiha\", Assad's notorious loyalist militia. However, it is important to note that many of HTS's critics, past and present, and some of the those imprisoned by the group, were hardliners actively inciting opposition to HTS's project in Idlib. Others were locals and activists who criticised what they described as HTS's monopolisation of power and \"authoritarian\" rule.\n\nHardliners vs liberals: Religious restrictions\n\nAlthough some locals have voiced complaints about religious restrictions in Idlib, as reported by Arab media and NGOs, these grievances have not been widespread. This may be due to HTS's relative flexibility and the fact that most residents of the province are conservative Sunni Muslims who may be generally accepting of the status quo. Indeed, HTS has often come in for harsh criticism by hardliners for being too \"lenient\" and failing to impose strict Sharia rules in Idlib. Al-Sharaa has argued that the imposition of strict rules such as the morality police is an outdated idea that often causes more harm than good. In April 2023 he said: \"We don't want to create a hypocritical society that prays when we're around and doesn't when we're gone.\" He emphasised that he wanted people to adhere to Islamic teachings out of conviction, \"not through the stick [force]\".\n\nReuters In early 2024, Al-Sharaa's Ministry of Interior established a \"public morality police\"\n\nDespite these comments, the group has often responded by employing strict measures in a clear effort to appease hardliners - a pattern that offers insight into how HTS may respond to such pressures in future. For example, despite dissolving various Hisba (morality police) structures that operated under thinly-veiled names and despite the vocal objections of al-Sharaa himself, the SSG nevertheless established a \"public morality police\" under its Ministry of Interior in early 2024. These morality forces regulated shops, ensured women wore compliant religious clothing and limited the mixing of sexes in public spaces. And a few months earlier, the SSG's Ministry of Education had issued a decree mandating that all female students and staff wear \"loose Islamic dress that complies with Sharia\", which includes covering one's hair and avoiding \"fashion and trends\" deemed \"incompatible with our religious teachings\". The decree also prohibited the mixing of sexes in primary and secondary schools.\n\nOther rebel rivalries\n\nUntil recently, the dominant feature of Syria's opposition groups - whether rebel or jihadist - was disunity and fragmentation, often marked by bouts of infighting. Armed factions competed over territory, revenue sources, authority and ideology. For years, this persistent disunity, among other factors, severely hampered their ability to achieve victory over Assad. The recent rebel unity that led to Assad's downfall remains a relatively new development and could still prove fragile. Also, there are internal challenges still posed by rival factions.\n\nGetty Images HTS has a history of tense relations with Syria's other major rebel groups\n\nHTS has long had a strained relationship with the other major rebel bloc in Syria, the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The SNA's focus during the recent offensive has largely aligned with Ankara's priorities - seizing Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria to eliminate what Turkey perceives as a Kurdish \"threat\" along its borders. Whether the two blocs can agree on the division of the strategic locations seized from Kurdish forces - or across Syria more broadly - remains uncertain, particularly as HTS continues to push for complete unity, clearly under its own leadership. IS, which remains active in Syria through both operatives and sleeper cells, has declared its ongoing jihad in the country and denounced the HTS-led rebel authority as \"apostates\" allegedly brought to power by \"infidel\" forces. With the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) weakening in the northeast, IS is likely to set its sights on the prisons and camps in Hasaka that hold IS-linked fighters and their families. A mass release or escape from these facilities could significantly bolster IS's ranks and ability to destabilise Syria. Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011 - and Assad's brutal crackdown on the uprising - the country has attracted a wide range of foreign fighters, clerics and transnational jihadist groups, facilitated by porous borders, particularly via Turkey.\n\nReuters A man steps on a torn photograph of ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad\n\nTo consolidate its control over Idlib, and possibly as part of deals with foreign powers to contain the jihadist threat in northern Syria, HTS crushed some local and foreign factions and co-opted others, integrating them into its own structures, renaming their units to obscure their foreign origins. These include smaller factions from Central Asia, the Caucasus (Chechens) and China's Uighur minority. Many of these smaller factions, including independent jihadist groups like Ansar al-Islam and Ansar al-Tawhid, actively participated in the latest offensive, which highlights their potential vested interest in shaping the future of the new Syria. In terms of post-Assad messaging, groups like al-Qaeda as well as more moderate Islamist figures and scholars have reminded HTS about its \"obligation\" to ensure the set-up of an Islamic system in Syria, distinguished by a strong Sunni identity.\n\n'Power grab'\n\nWhen asked by a CNN correspondent on 6 December whether HTS intends to impose an Islamic system, al-Sharaa gave a characteristically evasive response. Instead of a direct \"yes\" or \"no\", he stated, \"People who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\" This carefully worded answer suggest that HTS likely plans to implement Islamic governance, but perhaps in a more flexible and nuanced form. But already since HTS toppled the Assad government, ideological tensions have begun to resurface after the initial euphoria and unified effort to achieve a common goal. On 9 December HTS issued a decree granting amnesty to former military conscripts, but hardliners in Syria denounced the move as overly \"lenient\" and inconsistent with Sharia law, going so far as to incite disobedience and call for revenge attacks against ex-government loyalists, directly defying the HTS order.\n\nHTS attempted to quell the uproar by issuing a statement clarifying that it would pursue former government personnel and loyalists implicated in war crimes - an apparent attempt to appease critics. At the same time, HTS sought to reinforce its authority, explicitly vowing to punish anyone who defied its decree by engaging in vigilante revenge. Another point of contention arose on 16 December when al-Sharaa announced plans to disband and disarm militant groups and militias in the country, concentrating weapons in the hands of the state and the military alone. Again, hardliners protested, urging factions to retain their arms. They argued the move would consolidate power under HTS, leaving no other groups armed to challenge its authority and paving the way for tyranny. Further discontent emerged over HTS's muted response to repeated Israeli airstrikes in Syria following Assad's fall. After days of silence, on 14 December al-Sharaa criticised the strikes but stated that his group had no intention of engaging in any new conflicts, emphasising its current focus on rebuilding Syria. He also stated that he would not allow Syria to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.\n\nReuters Some hardliners may take up arms against HTS if it strays from their vision of a religious Syria\n\nSome viewed this stance as weak and a betrayal of Islamist principles. Their frustration was amplified by al-Qaeda's recent message urging HTS to prioritise the fight against Israel and fulfil its \"obligation\" to defend Palestinians in Gaza. These tensions suggest that hardliners - both within HTS ranks and external factions - may be willing to take up arms against the group if they perceive it as straying too far from their vision for a new religious Syria. Many of these individuals and factions are deeply invested in the country and are unlikely to relinquish their ambitions easily. They view Syria, much like Afghanistan under the Taliban, as a project for a strong Sunni Islamic state - one that could wield regional influence while serving as a safe haven for persecuted Muslims and jihadist fugitives. Under pressure from liberals and hardliners alike, al-Sharaa and HTS are treading a fine line in an attempt not to antagonise either side too much and the need for flexibility appears to be key.

This week al-Sharaa was photographed with two British diplomats, one of whom was Ann Snow, the UK's special representative for Syria. Her hair was uncovered. Top image credit: Getty",

    "body": "Critics praise Chalamet's portrayal of Bob Dylan\n\n11 December 2024 Share Save Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images Chalamet sings all the songs in the film himself, rather than lip-syncing to the original Dylan recordings\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet has been praised by critics for his portrayal of Bob Dylan, in a new film biopic of the US singer-songwriter. A Complete Unknown has already scored three Golden Globe nominations and is likely to be in the Oscars race in the new year. The Guardian said Chalamet showed \"amazing bravado\" in his performance, while Empire said the actor is \"superb\" and his \"musical talent is unimpeachable\". But the Independent said the biopic itself \"plays too safe\" and Screen Rant described the \"serviceable\" film as a \"fascinating yet frustrating\" portrait.\n\nA Complete Unknown is released on Christmas Day in the US, and 17 January in the UK. Dylan himself has endorsed the film, although he had not actually seen it at the time he posted about it last week on X. \"Timmy's a brilliant actor so I'm sure he's going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me,\" Dylan said.\n\nSearchlight Deadline praised Chalamet's \"remarkable\" portrayal of Dylan\n\nIn her three-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said the film \"takes a reverent stance to Dylan's artistry, populated by technically accomplished musical performances\". She said Chalamet's voice \"isn't perfect, but it's undoubtedly impressive\", adding the film is \"shot with a real sensitivity to the emotional landscape of each track\". The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric! Set in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Dylan's rise to fame, and the conflict between his folk roots and his desire to expand his repertoire to include rock 'n' roll. The friction is represented by the choice between his use of an acoustic and electric guitar, and Dylan's lyrics gradually become bolder and more reflective of the world he sees around him.\n\nGetty Images Dylan, pictured in 2012, said he was \"sure [Chalamet] is going to be completely believable as me\"\n\nThe film climaxes with a famously chaotic performance at at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, where Dylan was booed by some members of the audience for playing an electric set with an amplified band. Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the film's production design, costumes and cinematography, as well as its lead performance. \"At the centre of this all is a remarkable performance by Chalamet, who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lip-syncing or blending of voices between actor and subject,\" he noted. \"The music of course is worth the price of admission, but in Mangold's hands fortunately there is so much more to add, thus making Bob Dylan a little less than complete unknown by the time the credits roll.\" The film also follows Dylan's romantic relationships with two women in particular - civil rights activist Sylvie Russo (played by Elle Fanning) and folk musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).\n\nReuters Chalamet attended the film's LA premiere on Tuesday with co-stars Monica Barbaro and Elle Fanning\n\nScreen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki reflected: \"I could understand both women more clearly than Chalamet's Dylan. Behind his sunglasses and tight body language, Dylan remains elusive. \"The film is very much about an artist who doesn't explain himself, and I have immense respect for that, but it also creates an emotional disconnect in narrative form. It was as though I was watching a series of events that I couldn't bring myself to care about. That's what Mangold risks by keeping Dylan out of reach.\" There was a rave review from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, who awarded the film five stars and praised Chalamet's \"hilarious and seductive portrayal\". \"Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format,\" he said. It's all rise, but troubled and unclear.\" The Times Kevin Maher was far less enthusiastic, awarding just two stars \"There will be audiences who will regard the recreation of Newport '65 as a monumental cinematic event. But for many it will land with a giant shrug of indifference,\" he noted. \"[Chalamet's] performance is an unhelpful study in blank-eyed lockjaw minimalism, while his singing voice is fine if, occasionally, close to parody (but all Dylan imitators sound like parody).\"\n\nSearchlight Dylan's relationship with folk singer Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro) is explored in the film\n\nWith an acclaimed back catalogue built up over seven decades, Dylan is best known for hits such as Blowin in the Wind, Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe, Girl From The North Country and The Times They Are a Changin'. \"Perhaps Dylan himself is too mercurial a figure for a biopic to ever capture him completely,\" wrote the Telegraph's Robbie Collin in a four-star review. \"A Complete Unknown comes about as close as one could reasonably hope. \"For the most part, the film plays like a juicy rise-to-power drama rather than a scenic tour of an artist's Wikipedia page.\" Elsewhere, the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis joked the film made him \"really, really want to learn to play harmonica\". \"It's a defiantly unlikeable performance, miles away from Chalamet's romantic leads,\" Curtis noted. \"He captures Dylan's craning stance and the way he used hair and sunglasses as a mask, the insistent buzz and keen of his speaking and singing voice and the odd, touchy, insularity.\" A Complete Unknown also stars Edward Norton and is directed by James Mangold, the filmmaker behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line and films in the X-Men and Indiana Jones franchises.\n\nSearchlight The film is directed by James Mangold, who was also behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line",

    "body": "Mosley's cause of death 'indeterminate', coroner finds\n\n20 December 2024 Share Save Amy Walker BBC News Share Save\n\nBBC/PA Media\n\nAn inquest into the death of broadcaster Dr Michael Mosley has not been able to determine a cause, with the coroner instead recording an open conclusion. The 67-year-old science journalist went missing in June after going for a walk on the Greek island of Symi. His disappearance sparked a high-profile search effort by emergency services and his body was found after four days. In written findings, senior coroner for Buckinghamshire Crispin Butler said the cause of Dr Mosley's death was \"indeterminate\" and \"unascertainable\" - and \"was most likely attributable either to heatstroke (accidental) or non-identified pathological cause\".\n\nMr Butler said Dr Mosley's death was not found to be as a result of homicide, suicide, or an accident related to injuries. An open conclusion by a coroner means there is insufficient evidence to decide how a death came about - the case is left open in case further evidence comes to light. Dr Mosley, a broadcaster for almost 20 years, known for programmes that focused on diet, exercise and medicine, had been staying with family and friends when they travelled to Pedi Beach on the morning of 5 June, a findings document said. Michael Mosley's 'genius' remembered in tribute programmes \"Michael had intentionally left his mobile phone back at the house to prevent it getting wet on the ferry,\" the document added. \"Later in the afternoon Michael decided he was going to walk back home rather than take the ferry.\" The findings said Dr Mosley had a rucksack, a litre of water, a biscuit, a hat and an umbrella with him and was \"described as looking energetic and cheerful as he set off\".\n\nPA Media Following a large search effort, Dr Mosley's body was found next to a fence around 30 minutes walk from Pedi, where he was last seen",

    "title": "Royal Christmas cards: What are they trying to tell us?",
    "body": "What are royal Christmas cards trying to tell us?\n\n21 December 2024 Share Save Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Share Save\n\nKensington Palace Prince William and Catherine used a picture of their family together in Norfolk\n\nIt's become a seasonal tradition to seek the hidden message or symbolic meaning in the Christmas cards the royals send out, as they keep changing and reinventing the format. This year's card from King Charles and Queen Camilla shows them looking relaxed and maybe relieved - and there is a very personal significance behind this picture. It was the first photoshoot after the King was given the green light that he was well enough to return to public duties, after beginning his cancer treatment. It was said to be a watershed moment for the couple, caught on camera. The same pictures, with images full of spring rebirth, were then used for the official announcement that the King had made sufficient progress with his treatment to go back to public events. The lack of snowy steeples and robins isn't a surprise, as royal Christmas cards rarely seem to show any signs of winter. And the message, printed in red, always looks like a party invitation from the 1950s. Prince Harry and Meghan have given their own twist to royal cards. They've added some glitz, so that it has the feel of film credits as much as a season's greeting.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan's card included pictures of their children\n\nIt's an upbeat Californian message, sent out as an e-card, with six pictures rather than a single image, showing the couple hugging and laughing. It also drew comments on the rare appearance of their son and daughter. If cards could have an accent, this would undoubtedly sound American. It's a \"Happy Holiday Season\", with no mention of \"Christmas\". But then, they've spent most of their married life in the US.\n\nPA Media This year's card from the King and Queen had a very personal connection\n\nPrince William and Catherine's cards have used more informal pictures in recent years. It's jeans and no ties, a modern family, without any royal imagery. This year's card kept the same relaxed style, but it had a very poignant significance. It was from the video that announced that Catherine had completed her chemotherapy. It shows William and Catherine and their three children in Norfolk in August, from a video that was full of end-of-summer colours and very emotional messages about a tough year since her cancer diagnosis. It was a strikingly different style of royal communication, unashamedly about love and togetherness - and they've used it again for the Christmas card.\n\nPA Media Last year's card echoed the informal, no-jackets-and-ties style\n\nLast year's card from the Prince and Princess of Wales had also been a talking point. It featured the same jackets-off, casual image, but there was also a designer chic, with an arty black-and-white picture that wouldn't have looked out of place in an upmarket jeans advert. The prince is very keen on sustainability, so maybe next year's will be made out of recyclable seaweed. Christmas cards can also be like time capsules, holding a moment. In 1995 Prince William appeared alongside his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, and his brother Prince Harry in this rather haunting image. It really evokes another era.\n\nDiana's card from 1995 captured a moment in time\n\nThere's often a sense of family closeness projected by the cards. The late Queen Elizabeth II was always pictured with Prince Philip. And King Charles and Queen Camilla have continued to use images of themselves as a couple. That's had to be mixed up with some props over the years. For the 2019 card the then Prince Charles and Camilla were pictured in a vintage sports car, in a photo taken on a trip to Cuba. It was more or less made for a Prince of Wheels headline.\n\nGetty Images The cards have always emphasised family, but have experimented with the settings\n\nPA Media The royals gathered around a speed boat in this 1969 Christmas card\n\nThere was also a picture of the Royal Family standing around a speed boat in 1969, looking like winners on a game show.\n\nBelgian royals take a traditional approach to their Christmas card\n\nChristmas cards might be slipping out of fashion - sales of boxes of cards are down 23% in a year, according to retailers John Lewis. But the royals show no sign of losing interest - and that includes European royal families... although their use of a family group in a posh room isn't always that original. The Belgian royal card has a multi-lingual message, which is inclusive and reflects a multi-lingual country, but risks looking like a Eurostar menu. It's also unusually forward-looking, with the date of 2025.\n\nPA Media The Spanish royals used their card to address grievances over this year's floods\n\nSpanish royals this year used their card to send a more serious message. There was a standard family group photo on the front, but inside was a poem that was a tribute to the victims of the Valencia flood. Last month, Spain's king and queen had been pelted with mud when they visited areas hit by the floods.\n\nPA Media Christmas cards don't always conform to what's expected\n\nYou couldn't say that the Christmas card pictures are always predictable or easy to interpret. What was the thinking behind the 2016 card which used a photo of Prince Charles and Camilla on a trip to Croatia? An unexpected Eurovision entry?\n\nGetty Images A wartime Christmas card sent by a young Princess Elizabeth",

    "body": "Estonia navy to protect undersea power link after main cable damaged\n\n27 December 2024 Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Share Save\n\nEstonian military The patrol boat Raju's main task will be to protect the Estlink 1 power cable\n\nNato has said it will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea, and Estonia has sent a patrol ship to protect its Estlink1 undersea power cable, after Russia was accused of sabotaging its main power link in the Gulf of Finland. A ship named as Eagle S is suspected of damaging the Estlink 2 cable and Finnish coast guard crew have boarded the oil tanker and steered it into Finnish waters. The EU said the Eagle S was part of \"Russia's shadow fleet\" and the failure of the undersea cable was the \"latest in a series of suspected attacks on critical infrastructure\". Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said the Raju had set sail early on Friday and he believed Finland would join the operation to protect the remaining cable.\n\nHe told Estonian public radio that the Raju's task was \"to ensure that nothing happens there and that our critical connection with Finland remains operational\". The Kremlin has declined to comment on the damage to the cable, describing it as a \"very narrow issue\" and not an issue for the Russian presidency. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte said on social media that he had spoken to Finland's president, Alexander Stubb, adding that Nato would boost its presence in the Baltic. A further statement by the alliance said only that \"Nato remains vigilant and is working to provide further support\". Finland and Estonia are both Nato members and Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal told public TV that, if necessary, they would invoke Article 4 of the Nato Treaty, which involves consultation if any member state feels threatened. \"Our wish would be to receive reinforcements from Nato in the form of a fleet to act as a deterrent,\" he was quoted as saying by news agency BNS. Estonia's power supply has been dramatically reduced after its 170km (105-mile) Estlink 2 cable was shut down. In its initial assessment on Thursday, Finland's Fingrid company said repairs to the cable could last until the end of July 2025. The damage to Estlink 2 is the third incident in little more than a month in the Baltic Sea.\n\nLast month, two data cables were severed: the Arelion cable between the Swedish island of Gotland and Lithuania on 17 November, and then the C-Lion 1 cable was damaged between the Finnish capital, Helsinki, and the German port of Rostock. A Chinese ship, the Yi Peng 3, was suspected of dragging its anchor over the cables in a separate act of Russian sabotage. In October 2023, another Chinese ship ruptured an undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia. The Yi Peng 3 and Eagle S are both suspected of being part of a so-called shadow fleet of oil tankers that Russia is using to avoid Western sanctions imposed since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock The Yi Peng 3 eventually set sail from the Kattegat strait last week",

Derek Heggie made two \"ill-informed and potentially dangerous\" YouTube videos between 2 and 8 August, Carlisle Crown Court heard. The 41-year-old, of Welsh Road in Harraby, Carlisle, admitted sending communication of an offensive nature earlier this month. Jailing him for 10 months and two weeks, Judge Nicholas Barker said it was clear that Heggie had wanted his offensive comments about the Muslim faith \"to be read and heard by many\".\n\nThe killings of three children on 29 July in Southport triggered waves of unrest across the country. Heggie, who described himself as an actor and podcast host, was one of several people in north and west Cumbria to be prosecuted for the use of inflammatory online content. Prosecutor Tim Evans said the posts were \"in whole or in part of an offensive nature\". He said that one of Heggie's videos had had almost 500,000 views and that they could be circulated to people who did not subscribe to them.\n\nTime of unrest\n\nThe court heard that the defendant had 32 previous convictions including assaulting a police officer and a racially aggravated public order offence. Tariq Khawam, defending, said: \"He knows what he did was wrong, ill-informed and potentially dangerous.\" Addressing Heggie, Judge Barker said: \"What was clear in your mind was that these statements were to have a broad reach and to be read and heard by many. \"You did this at a time of great unrest and concern. \"It is clear the messages were intended to be grossly offensive, particularly to those of a Muslim faith,\" the judge added.\n\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "body": "Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Timothee Chalamet up for Golden Globes\n\n9 December 2024 Share Save Ian Youngs Culture reporter Share Save\n\nReuters Ariana Grande has been entered in the supporting actress categories, while Cynthia Erivo is classed as Wicked's lead actress\n\nWicked's Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are among the stars who have scored nominations for the Golden Globes, as the Hollywood award season kicks off in earnest. British actress Erivo is shortlisted for best female actor in a comedy or musical film for her role as Elphaba, while co-star Grande is in the running for best supporting female actor for playing Glinda. Angelina Jolie, Hugh Grant, Timothee Chalamet, Sebastian Stan, Demi Moore, Pamela Anderson, Kate Winslet and Selena Gomez are among the other big names in contention. The Golden Globes have been through controversy in recent years but remain the first major awards in the film calendar, and provide pointers for who could do well at next year's Oscars.\n\nNetflix musical Emilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, leads the nominations overall with 10, including one for Gomez. Other prominent films include heavyweight dramas The Brutalist, about a Hungarian architect who tries to build a new life in the US after World War Two, and Conclave, about a group of scheming cardinals who gather to select the new Pope.\n\nNetflix Selena Gomez (centre) has two acting nominations this year\n\nThe top film nominees: Emilia Perez - 10\n\nThe Brutalist - 7\n\nConclave - 6\n\nAnora - 5\n\nThe Substance - 5 Unlike the Oscars, the Golden Globes also have awards for TV shows, with The Bear, Only Murders in the Building, Shogun and Baby Reindeer the main contenders in those categories.\n\nOscar contenders\n\nJolie is the frontrunner to win best female actor in a drama film for playing legendary opera singer Maria Callas in Maria. She will face competition from Nicole Kidman for Babygirl, as well as Anderson for playing a veteran Las Vegas showgirl in The Last Showgirl. British stars Winslet and Tilda Swinton are also in that category, as is Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres. Winslet has two nominations in total - one on the film side for playing war photographer Lee Miller in Lee, and one for portraying a fictional dictator in her TV show The Regime.\n\nUniversal Pictures Adrien Brody is a strong contender for his performance in The Brutalist\n\nIn the race for best male actor in a drama film, The Brutalist's Adrien Brody and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes are seen as the main contenders. Meanwhile, Stan is nominated for playing Donald Trump in The Apprentice, about the incoming US president's early years, and Chalamet is recognised for portraying singer Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown. They are joined on the shortlist by former James Bond star Daniel Craig for playing a US expat in 1950s South America in Queer, and Colman Domingo for his role in Sing Sing, about a prison theatre group. All will also have a shot of receiving Oscar nominations when they are announced in January.\n\nNewcomers and veterans\n\nUnlike the Oscars, the Golden Globe split most of their categories in two, with one award for dramas and a separate prize for musicals/comedies. Newcomer Mikey Madison is hotly tipped for the award for best female actor in a musical/comedy film for playing a New York stripper who falls for the son of a Russian oligarch in Anora. She will take on others including Demi Moore, who has won praise for her role as a veteran Hollywood star who goes to extreme lengths to recapture her youth in body horror The Substance. It is Moore's first nomination for 28 years.\n\nNeon US actress Mikey Madison (right) scored her first Globe nomination for Anora\n\nZendaya, Amy Adams and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n are in the same category, as is Erivo, one of four nominations in total for Wicked. The film, based on the Broadway musical about the origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West from the Wizard of Oz, will hope to combine awards acclaim with commercial success after making $455m (\u00a3356m) so far at the box office. Grande will go up against fellow singer and former children's TV star Gomez, who plays the wife of the drug lord in Emilia P\u00e9rez. Gomez is a double nominee, also being shortlisted for TV comedy Only Murders in the Building.\n\nBritish talent\n\nA number of British stars have made it on to the shortlists. Grant has the seventh Golden Globe nomination of his career, for horror film Heretic, while Felicity Jones has her second for The Brutalist, a decade after her first for The Theory of Everything. Her co-star in the latter, Eddie Redmayne, is also hoping for a Golden Globe this year, for his TV show The Day of the Jackal. He will go up against Gary Oldman for Slow Horses, while his co-star Jack Lowden is listed in one of the supporting categories.\n\nPA Media Keira Knightley attended the premiere of Black Doves in London last week\n\nElsewhere, Keira Knightley is nominated for her new spy drama Black Doves. Her competitors include Emma D'Arcy, who has House of the Dragon's only citation. Richard Gadd stands a strong chance of winning best male actor in a limited series for Baby Reindeer. His rivals include fellow Scot Ewan McGregor, for A Gentleman in Moscow. Baby Reindeer's Jessica Gunning is in the running for best supporting female TV actor. Pop star Robbie Williams is up for the best song award for Forbidden Road, from his forthcoming film biopic Better Man, along with his co-writers Sacha Skarbek and Freddy Wexler. Wallace and Gromit are in the best animated motion picture category for their new film Vengeance Most Fowl, ahead of its premiere on the BBC on Christmas Day. And dramatist Peter Straughan is named for writing the script for Conclave.\n\nSnubs\n\nHowever, there was no nomination for Britain's Marianne Jean-Baptiste, who had been tipped to be recognised for her role in director Mike Leigh's hard-hitting film Hard Truths. And there was nothing for British film Blitz or Saoirse Ronan, who had been in contention for that film and another acclaimed drama, The Outrun. Fellow Irish star Paul Mescal missed out on a nod for Gladiator II, which only received two nominations - one for Denzel Washington in the acting categories, and a nod for cinematic and box office achievement, which was introduced last year to recognise popular films.\n\nParamount Denzel Washington is nominated for Gladiator II, but Paul Mescal is not\n\nThere were also two nominations for Dune: Part Two - best drama film and best original score. But voters overlooked Chalamet's lead performance and Denis Villeneuve's direction. And there was no room for the Dune sequel on the eight-strong shortlist for the cinematic and box office achievement prize despite it being fourth on the global list of the most successful releases of 2024. Wicked is among the hits up for that award this year, although its mastermind Jon M Chu missed out on a nomination for best director.\n\nReuters Comedian Nikki Glaser is a nominee as well as being the ceremony's host",

    "body": "Blake Lively accuses co-star Justin Baldoni of smear campaign\n\n21 December 2024 Share Save Malu Cursino BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nBlake Lively has filed a legal complaint against It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment and a campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation. According to the legal filing, she accuses Mr Baldoni and his team of attacking her public image following a meeting in which she brought along her actor husband, Ryan Reynolds, to address \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Mr Baldoni and a producer on the movie. Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met. In the romantic drama, Ms Lively plays a woman who finds herself in a relationship with a charming but abusive boyfriend, played by Mr Baldoni.\n\nThe meeting between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni, together with others involved in the movie's production, took place on 4 January this year, and it aimed to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set, says the legal filing. Ms Lively's husband, Deadpool star Mr Reynolds, who did not appear in It Ends With Us, joined her at the showdown, according to the legal complaint, which is one step before a lawsuit. Mr Baldoni, 40, attended the meeting in his capacity as co-chairman and co-founder of the company that produced the film, Wayfarer Studios. He was also the film's director. In the legal complaint, Ms Lively's lawyers allege that both Mr Baldoni and the Wayfarer chief executive officer, Jamey Heath, engaged in \"inappropriate and unwelcome behavior towards Ms Lively and others on the set of It Ends With Us\". In the filing to the California Civil Rights Department, a list of 30 demands relating to the pair's alleged misconduct was made at the meeting to ensure they could continue to produce the film. Among them, Ms Lively, 37, requested that there be no more mention of Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath's previous \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively or to other crew members, no more descriptions of their own genitalia to Ms Lively, and \"no more adding of sex scenes, oral sex, or on camera climaxing by BL [Blake Lively] outside the scope of the script BL approved when signing onto the project\", says the complaint. Ms Lively also demanded that Mr Baldoni stop saying he could speak to her dead father.\n\nJose Perez/Bauer-Griffin via Getty Images It Ends With Us has sparked some controversy over how the film depicts domestic violence\n\nMs Lively's legal team further accuse Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios of leading a \"multi-tiered plan\" to wreck her reputation. She alleges this was \"the intended result of a carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others from speaking out about the hostile environment that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath created\". Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\" Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\". He alleged that Ms Lively's claims were \"intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media\". In a statement via her attorneys to the BBC, Ms Lively said: \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\" She also denied that she or any of her representatives had planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer.\n\nThe film was a box-office hit, although some critics said it romanticised domestic violence. Soon after the release date in August, another co-star, Brandon Sklenar, hinted in an Instagram post at rumours of a rift between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni. Speculation of a falling out only grew when they did not appear together on the red carpet. It Ends With Us tells the story of Boston florist Lily Bloom, played by Ms Lively, as she navigates a love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend, Ryle Kincaid, played by Mr Baldoni, and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan, played by Mr Sklenar. It is based on a best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover. The 45-year-old author has previously said her inspiration was domestic abuse her mother endured.\n\nGetty Images Lively posed for photos with Sklenar (left) and her husband Ryan Reynolds at the premiere, but not her co-star Baldoni",

    "body": "Russia is executing more and more Ukrainian prisoners of war\n\n22 December 2024 Share Save Vitaliy Shevchenko BBC Monitoring Russia editor Share Save\n\nFacebook Oleksandr Matsievsky is now an iconic figure in Ukraine after his execution by Russian forces\n\nUkrainian sniper Oleksandr Matsievsky was captured by Russians in the first year of the full-scale invasion. Later, a video emerged showing him smoking his last cigarette in a forest, apparently next to a grave he had been forced to dig. \"Glory to Ukraine!\" he says to his captors. Moments later, shots ring out and he falls dead. His execution is one of many. In October this year, nine captured Ukrainian soldiers were reportedly shot dead by Russian forces in Kursk region. Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating the case including a photo showing half-naked bodies lying on the ground. This photo was enough for one of the victims, drone operator Ruslan Holubenko, to be identified by his parents. \"I recognised him by his underwear,\" his distraught mother told local broadcaster Suspilne Chernihiv. \"I bought it for him before a trip to the sea. I also knew that his shoulder had been shot through. You could see that in the picture.\" The list of executions goes on. Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating reports of beheadings and a sword being used to kill a Ukrainian soldier with his hands tied behind his back. In another instance, a video showed 16 Ukrainian soldiers apparently being lined up and then mowed down with automatic gunfire after emerging from a woods to surrender.\n\nGetty Images Russia and Ukraine have released some prisoners, including this Ukrainian pictured after his release in September 2024\n\nSome of the executions were filmed by Russian forces themselves, while others were observed by Ukrainian drones hovering above. The killings captured on such videos usually take place in woods or fields lacking distinctive features, which makes confirming their exact location difficult. BBC Verify, however, has been able to confirm in several cases - such as one beheading - that the victims wear Ukrainian uniforms and that the videos are recent.\n\nRising numbers\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecution service says that at least 147 Ukrainian prisoners of war have been executed by Russian forces since the start of the full-scale invasion, 127 of them this year. \"The upward trend is very clear, very obvious,\" says Yuri Belousov, the head of the War Department at the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office. \"Executions became systemic from November last year and have continued throughout all of this year. Sadly, their number has been particularly on the rise this summer and autumn. This tells us that they are not isolated cases. They are happening across vast areas and they have clear signs of being part of a policy - there is evidence that instructions to this effect are being issued.\" International humanitarian law - particularly the Third Geneva Convention - offers protection to prisoners of war, and executing them is a war crime.

Chvrches' debut single, The Mother We Share, was written and recorded in 48 hours, using the only three synths they owned - but it became a word of mouth hit, earning them airplay on BBC Radio 1 and support slots with Passion Pit and Depeche Mode. In the press, they carefully presented themselves as a band, with each member receiving equal billing. But Mayberry says she worried about being the junior partner. \"I was always conscious that I was younger than the other guys, and they had a lot more experience,\" she says. \"They\u2019d been to music school, and I hadn't. So I always felt like I was on the back foot, in terms of where I sat in the hierarchy.\" That feeling was amplified during a 2019 tour of Australia. The itinerary gave the band a four-day break in Melbourne, and Mayberry was looking forward to spending the downtime with her bandmates and the crew - until she discovered they'd made separate plans and she was stranded in her hotel room. \"I remember being very upset and hurt by that because I was always worrying about everyone else and taking care of everybody, and it was a humbling moment,\" she says. \"In the end, I hired a little car and drove to an Australian spa town and had a wee cry listening to Taylor Swift\u2019s Cruel Summer.\" Looking back, she thinks that being the only woman in the touring party left her carrying the \"emotional labour\" of keeping the show on the road. \"I feel like I twisted myself into a pretzel sometimes to make everyone happy. \"Then I\u2019d look back and think, \u2018And were you happy?' \"Not really, but I was keeping the peace.\"\n\nCharlotte Patmore The singer's debut album is titled Vicious Creature after a lyric she'd written years ago: \"Nostalgia is such a vicious creature / Another way to say that you fear the future\"\n\nShe considered leaving the band after that Australian incident. Then Covid struck, and Chvrches ended up making a fourth album, 2021's Screen Violence, remotely. She finally took the plunge a year later, but not before signing a new record deal with her bandmates, assuring the future of the project. \"I was conscious it would give people a sense of security, that I\u2019d made a commitment,\" she says. \"I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s how it actually works, but that was my hope.\" She\u2019s keen to stress there\u2019s no bad blood: Doherty and Cook have given her their full support. Still, it\u2019s natural for someone leaving a band to define themselves in opposition to that music - otherwise what\u2019s the point? As Mayberry succinctly puts it: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a crap knock-off Chvrches record.\u201d In recording sessions, she'd flinch when anyone pulled out a vintage synth. Instead, she pursued a more organic, lyrics-first approach. But after a decade in a trio, the instinct to compromise was hard-wired. \u201cI'm very used to arguing my point, then trying to see other people's point of view,\" she says. \"So it was a real learning curve to be like, \u2018No, this is my opinion, and if I don't think it's right, then it's not right, and that's the end of the conversation'.\u201d\n\nCrying wolf\n\nThe result is Vicious Creature, an album that showcases new depths to Mayberry\u2018s voice, which fluctuates between vulnerability and venom, while paying homage to her pop heroines. She channels the spirit of All Saints on the album opener Something In The Air; and borrows the choppy, sampled strings of Annie Lennox's Walking On Broken Glass to power the single Crocodile Tears. The latter is a furious riposte to an emotionally manipulative man, where Mayberry snarls: \u201cWhat a man will say just to get his way / Always crying wolf, so I\u2019m sad to say / I don\u2019t really wanna hear it from you, babe\". The singer says she's role-playing in that song, inspired by the dark, subversive femininity of Velma Kelly in the musical Chicago, or Cabaret's Sally Bowles. Listen to Lauren Mayberry on BBC Radio 4's Front Row It's one of several songs that survived the first incarnation of the album - tentatively titled Fiction - that would be \"dark, theatrical and character driven\". Slowly, over time, more personal songs started to creep into the mix. The syncopated pulse of Change Shapes is a condemnation of music industry sexism (\"I'm a doll inside a box, with a ball and a chain\"). Sorry, Etc tells a similar story over a chaotic hybrid of garage rock and drum & bass. \"There were definitely a few songs where it was at best expressing frustrations and at worst [feeling] kind of hurt,\" about her life in music, Mayberry says.\n\nChvrches playing at the BBC Maida Vale studios in 2013 (L-R): Martin Doherty, Lauren Mayberry and Iain Cook\n\nThe album's most intimate moment is a muted piano ballad called Oh, Mother. Over three verses, Mayberry documents the shifting relationship with her mother - from the unquestioning love of childhood to adolescent disgust and, finally, the realisation that their time together is limited. \"It kills me to know you won't be around,\" she sings gently. \"Oh mother, what will I do without you?\" The last song written for the record, the words poured out after Mayberry's friend and co-writer Dan McDougall sketched out the chords in the studio. Discussing the lyrics, which were inspired by a family illness, the singer becomes a little emotional. \"When you're living in the shadow of things like that, it's on your mind all the time,\" she says. \"I think about it all the time. When I go away on tour, I always think, \u2018Oh, is this the tour where I'm gone and I miss it\u2019. \"So that last afternoon in the studio was quite a weepy one... But then we went to Nando's. So it's all about balance.\"\n\nGetty Images The singer previewed her debut album on tour with Bleachers and London Grammar, along with smaller solo shows, earlier this year",

    "body": "Famous black ball final re-enacted 40 years on\n\n12 December 2024 Share Save Lee Blakeman BBC Radio Stoke Richard Price BBC News, West Midlands Share Save\n\nBBC Dennis Taylor won his first and only world championship - wearing the iconic \"upside down\" glasses - watched by 19 million people on TV\n\n\"The greatest snooker match of all time\" will be relived in Stoke-on-Trent after Dennis Taylor gained icon status 40 years ago by beating arch rival Steve Davis to become world champion. Taylor played the \"Black Ball Final\" of 1985 in Sheffield, in a match seen by 19 million people on BBC 2 that lasted until gone midnight. The match remains the channel's highest-rated show, and saw Taylor go cue-to-cue with Davis, who had won the title three times. Inevitably, Davis was favourite to win again, and had taken a seven frames lead. But Taylor - famed for his \"upside down\" glasses - made a miraculous comeback and potted the final black to win the match.\n\nIt provided the sport with the iconic moment of Taylor, wearing those glasses and raising his cue above his head, in celebration. He will appear at the Victoria Hall in Hanley for a show as part of a tour alongside Steve Davis and host John Virgo. The pair will recreate the classic match and also chat with audience members on the night.\n\nSteve Davis and Dennis Taylor will re-create their classic match from 1985\n\n\"John usually gets a couple of people out to do a few trick shots, then Steve and me play a couple of frames, then of course we re-enact that black ball final with the last few colours,\" Taylor said. \"Steve's very amusing about it as well, and the amazing thing about it is we re-enact that black ball final and I get to win every night.\" Taylor said during the second half of the show, they each do their \"own little bit\" \u2013 adding that Davis is \"very funny\" despite his previous reputation for seriousness. \"He was very, very serious when he was playing, he was very focussed - but he's so much fun. I love working with him,\" Taylor continued. \"The three of us interact with the audience and have a lot of fun.\" He said people still come up to him to talk about that night in 1985, and to take photos with him \u2013 adding that sometimes people turn their own glasses upside down. \"It's something that they all remember, they remember where they were when Steve and me were battling it out,\" he said.\n\nMindhouse Productions Taylor says people come up to him and turn their glasses upside down for a photo with him\n\n\"To keep nearly 19 million people up past midnight, watching a fella with ginger hair playing another fella with a big pair of upside down glasses, it's amazing how it captured everybody's imagination. \"Steve says he'll remember that final more than the six that he won.\" Taylor says they were involved in a \"bit of snooker history\", although at the time they had no idea how many people who might have been tuning in. \"If we'd ever thought there was that many people watching I don't think we'd have been able to hold the cue,\" he said. \"The audience kept building, and the BBC were cancelling programmes to stay with it, and it just built and built. \"The pressure on both of us was unbelievable, but we weren't thinking, we were just concentrating on the game.\"\n\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "title": "Robbie Williams explains why he's a monkey in his new movie",
    "body": "Robbie Williams on why he's played by a chimp in new film\n\n16 December 2024 Share Save Colin Paterson Entertainment correspondent Share Save\n\nEntertainment Robbie WIlliams is portrayed by a chimpanzee in the new biopic Better Man\n\nRobbie Williams is thoroughly enjoying his wander into the world of film, even if he is still learning the correct lingo. \"I was at this thing called the Governors' Ball the other night. That was amazing,\" the singer says. He is talking about the Governors' Awards, held in Los Angeles, where he joined other guests including Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig. \"I'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. I feel like an artist that's just been signed. I'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.\" The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man. \"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\"\n\nTony Dolce/BBC\n\nBetter Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two). The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey. At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail. To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party.\n\nEntertainment Better Man has been nominated for best song at the Golden Globes\n\nWilliams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence. Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman. Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey.\n\nMike Marsland/WireImage Take Hat! Better Man's director Michael Gracey at the film's European premiere in London\n\nFor a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life. \"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens. \"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'. \"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself. \"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\" Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.' \"I went, 'Monkey?' \"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\"\n\nEntertainment Jonno Davies plays Robbie Williams and provides his speaking voice, although the real Robbie Williams does the singing and a voiceover\n\nThe monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters. But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey. \"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear. \"There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.' \"And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'\"\n\nMe and My Monkey\n\nWilliams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022. \"We also scanned his eyes,\" explains Gracey, \"So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.\" \"I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,\" interrupts Williams. \"I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film. \"Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic.\"\n\nGetty Images Former All Saint Nicole Appleton attended the premiere of Better Man\n\nRobbie Williams sums up Better Man as \"the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation\". And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion. \"My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,\" Williams admits. \"She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend.\"\n\nChimp off the old block\n\nAppleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years. In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family. \"He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,\" says Williams. \"I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man. \"But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up.\"\n\nEntertainment The chimp version of Williams pictured in the film singing alongside his dad, played by Steve Pemberton\n\nThe film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That. \"There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,\" is his summary. \"I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.\" The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after. \"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says. \"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\" But these plans will have to wait.\n\nReuters In 2010 Robbie Williams mentored Liam Payne on The X Factor, when he was starting out in One Direction",

    "title": "Meet Karol G, Colombia's Taylor Swift",
    "body": "Meet Karol G, Colombia's Taylor Swift\n\n12 December 2024 Share Save Catherine Ellis Business reporter Reporting from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia Share Save\n\nGetty Images Karol G had four sold out shows at Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium this summer\n\nWe have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G? While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online. That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024. This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.\n\nSo who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year? Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005. Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it. While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked. She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed. Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.\n\nSmirnoff Karol G has a number of endorsement deals\n\nKarol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish. While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos. \"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world. \"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"\n\nToday on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%. Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this. And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.\n\nThis helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist. Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event. \"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds. Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map. \"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top. \"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.\n\nDespite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality. She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them. Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour. Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify. Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"\n\nGetty Images FC Barcelona had Karol G's name on the front of their shirts earlier this year",

    "body": "Magdeburg attack offers far right fertile ground despite suspect's backing for AfD\n\n24 December 2024 Share Save Bethany Bell BBC News in Magdeburg Share Save\n\nGetty Images Stallholders have been allowed back into the Christmas market after the attack\n\n\"I feel bad, I still do,\" said Eidwicht, as she stood in the Christmas market close to the spot where the car sped through on Friday, killing five people and injuring more than two hundred others. \"My granddaughter was here. I rang her because my daughter told me that something had happened here. And she didn't answer for two hours.\" There is deep sadness here - and anger directed at the government and migrants. \"It can't go on like this,\" said Eidwicht. A Saudi refugee aged 50 has been arrested for the attack but the motive is unknown. Officials say Taleb Al-Abdulmohsen, was an \"untypical\" attacker. Germany's Christmas markets and festivals have come under attack before, mainly from extreme Islamists. He has been described as critical of Islam and he also voiced support on social media for the far-right Alternative for Germany party, hailing the party for fighting the same enemy as him \"to protect Germany\".\n\nThe AfD has not commented on those posts. The party held a rally in Magdeburg later on Monday where co-leader Alice Weidel called for change \"so we can finally live once again in security\". The crowd responded with calls of \"deport them\" according to news agencies. Her party is currently riding high in the opinion polls ahead of federal elections on 23 February, especially in states like Saxony-Anhalt in the former East Germany. This attack has brought two big elections issues to the fore, security and immigration, and AfD figures have highlighted both since the attack. Despite the suspect's many statements expressing hostility to Islam, the head of the AfD in Sachsen-Anhalt, Martin Reichardt, said in a statement \"the attack in Magdeburg shows that Germany is being drawn into political and religious fanaticism that has its origins in another world\". In a post on X, Weidel said the government's discussion of new security laws following the attack \"must not distract from the fact that Magdeburg would not have been possible without uncontrolled immigration. The state must protect its citizens through a restrictive migration policy and consistent deportations!\"\n\nReuters AfD leader Alice Weidel said the attack would not have been possible without \"uncontrolled migration\"\n\nA counter-demonstration also took place, with anti-racism groups accusing the AfD of exploiting the attack. David Begrich from Miteinander e.V. said people in the city needed a chance to catch their breath. \"In the migrant communities, there is great concern about being made into a scapegoat,\" he said. \"We don't want that. We want to organise solidarity across society, but at the same time we are also sensitive to the voices of those who are now reacting with fear and uncertainty.\" German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made a plea for national unity, saying \"a dark shadow hangs over this Christmas\". \"Hatred and violence must not have the final word. Let's not allow ourselves to be driven apart. Let's stand together!\" he said. Germans are asking how the attack could have happened, when security was already heightened at Christmas markets and when authorities had clearly investigated the suspect several times in recent years. The threat he posed was considered \"too unspecific\", according to one assessment, while one tip-off against him in September 2023 appears to have fallen through the cracks.",

    "body": "What we know about mysterious drones over New Jersey and other states\n\n19 December 2024 Share Save Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, Washington Share Save\n\nGetty Images Dozens of people have reported seeing drones over New Jersey since 18 November\n\nUS aviation authorities have announced a temporary ban on the use of drones in nearly two dozen cities of New Jersey until mid January. But mystery continues to swirl after nearly a month of drone sightings over New Jersey and other US states, alarming some residents. Authorities have been unable to provide definitive answers about these sightings, saying only that the flying objects are not believed to pose a danger to the public or national security. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas confirmed the sightings included drones, as well as manned aircraft commonly mistaken for drones. He added that he knows of \"no foreign involvement\" to do with the unmanned aerial vehicles. Some lawmakers have criticised the government's handling of the drone reports and the lack of public information. The drone reports have prompted a wide-range of baseless conspiracy theories, including that they are searching for nuclear weapons, radioactive \"dirty bombs\" or are form part of an impending invasion by aliens. Here's what we know.\n\nWhere have drones been spotted?\n\nDozens of drone sightings have been reported over New Jersey since 18 November, but others have been reported around the US north-east. Some of the flights were spotted near Picatinny Arsenal - a sensitive military research facility - as well as near President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in the town of Bedminster, New Jersey. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has since issued temporary restrictions prohibiting drone flights over 22 cities including Bedminster and Picatinny until 17 January. Sightings have also been reported in several other states: In New York City , several drones were reported flying over the Bronx on 12 December\n\n, several drones were reported flying over the Bronx on 12 December Stewart Airfield in New York state had to shut down for about an hour on 13 December because of drone activity, Governor Kathy Hochul said\n\nstate had to shut down for about an hour on 13 December because of drone activity, Governor Kathy Hochul said In Connecticut , police confirmed \"suspicious drone activity\".

A drone detection system is now in use near the towns of Groton and New London In Maryland , former Republican Governor Larry Hogan said he saw what appeared to be \"dozens\" of drones over his home in Davidsonville\n\n, former Republican Governor Larry Hogan said he saw what appeared to be \"dozens\" of drones over his home in Davidsonville In Massachusetts , two men were arrested on 14 December after a \"hazardous drone operation\" near Logan International Airport's airspace in Boston, police said\n\n, two men were arrested on 14 December after a \"hazardous drone operation\" near Logan International Airport's airspace in Boston, police said Multiple sightings have been reported in eastern Pennsylvania, including over Philadelphia\n\nincluding over Philadelphia In October, the Wall Street Journal reported that mysterious drones were seen for 17 days near US military facilities in Virginia\n\nIn Ohio, a US Air Force base was briefly closed on 13 December after small drones were detected flying nearby. More drones were reported on 16 and 17 December, although the airbase's operations were not impacted In late November, drones were also spotted over three US airbases in the UK, with British defence sources telling the BBC suspicion had fallen on a \"state actor\". Drones were also reported near the Ramstein US military airbase in Germany in early December. Are mystery drones above US bases in England something sinister?\n\nWhat have investigators said about the drones?\n\nUS President Joe Biden has said that there is \"nothing nefarious\" about the drone sightings, and \"no sense of danger\". In an earlier call with reporters, officials from several US agencies said there was no evidence of any threat to public safety. \"I think there has been a slight overreaction,\" an official from the FBI said. The homeland security secretary told ABC News on Sunday he knows of \"no foreign involvement with respect to the sightings in the north-east\". \"And we are vigilant in investigating this matter,\" he said. Mayorkas added: \"If there is any reason for concern, if we identify any foreign involvement or criminal activity, we will communicate with the American public accordingly.\" Following a closed-door briefing on 17 December, Connecticut representative Jim Himes said that senior defence and law enforcement officials had told lawmakers that \"there is zero evidence of laws being broken\" by the drones. He added that the \"vast majority\" of sightings were normal aircraft or drones being operated lawfully. Himes said that \"millions\" of unregistered drones were operating across the US, in addition to 800,000 registered drones that weigh more than half a pound.\n\nWhat are these flying objects?\n\nFollowing a briefing with the Department of Homeland Security on 11 December, New Jersey assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia said the drones appeared to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio. Fantasia said the aircraft were up to 6ft (1.8m) in diameter, travelling with lights turned off and \"operate in a co-ordinated manner\". Secretary Mayorkas told ABC that an explanation for the uptick in drone sightings could be to do with a change in federal law last year that allowed drones to be flown at night. \"That may be one of the reasons why now people are seeing more drones than they did before, especially from dawn to dusk,\" he said. A joint statement released by the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, FAA and defence department on 16 December said the sightings are a \"combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones.\" \"We have not identified anything anomalous,\" the statement said, adding that the government still recognises \"the concern among many communities.\" President-elect Donald Trump, for his part, claimed that the \"government knows what is happening\". \"For some reason, they don't want to comment,\" he added. \"I think they'd be better off saying what it is our military knows and our president knows.\" While he declined to answer whether he had been briefed on the sightings, Trump said that he \"can't imagine it's the enemy.\"\n\nWhere are they coming from?\n\nIt is unclear who might be operating them. New Jersey Republican representative Jeff Van Drew said that the drones were coming from an Iranian \"mothership\" in the Atlantic, while Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi said there was a \"non-trivial\" chance that China could be involved. The Pentagon, White House and homeland security department have all insisted that there is no foreign origin for the objects. A northern California man was charged on with flying a drone over and taking pictures of Vandenberg Space Force Base, located near Santa Barbara, on 30 November. The man, 39-year-old Chinese national Yinpiao Zhou was arrested just before he boarded a flight to China. But there has been no suggestion this incident has any connection with the spate of drone reports on the other side of the country.\n\nGetty Images The Pentagon says there is no foreign origin for the objects\n\nCan the drones be stopped?",

There was, the Saudis say, no response.\n\nInside the imposing sand coloured and fortress-like walls of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Riyadh there is a perhaps justifiable sense of pique.\n\nThe Saudi authorities, I am told, are currently working flat out to collate everything they have on the Magdeburg market suspect, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, and to share it with Germany's ongoing investigation \"in every way possible\".\n\nPart of the explanation for this may lie in the fact that Taleb al-Abdulmohsen was granted asylum by Germany in 2016, one year after the former Chancellor Angela Merkel threw open her country's borders to let in more than a million migrants from the Middle East, and 10 years after al-Abdulmohsen had taken up residence in Germany.\n\nComing from a country where Islam is the only religion permitted to be practised in public, al-Abdulmohsen was a very unusual citizen.\n\nHe had turned his back on Islam, making himself a heretic in the eyes of many.\n\nBorn in the Saudi date palm oasis town of Hofuf in 1974, little is known about his early life before he decided to leave Saudi Arabia and move to Europe aged 32.\n\nActive on social media, on his Twitter (later X) account he labels himself as both a psychiatrist and founder of a Saudi rights movement, together with the tag @SaudiExMuslims.\n\nHe founded a website aimed at helping Saudi women flee their country to Europe.\n\nThe Saudis say he was a people trafficker and the Ministry of Interior's investigators, the Mabaatheth, are said to have an extensive file on him.\n\nThere have been reports in recent years of dissident Saudis coming under hostile surveillance from Saudi government agents, in Canada, the US and in Germany.\n\nThere is no question that the German authorities, both federal and state, have made some serious errors of omission in the case of al-Abdulmohsen.\n\nWhatever their reasons for not responding, as the Saudis claim, to the repeated warnings about his extremism, he was seemingly a danger to his adopted host country.\n\nThere is also, separately, the failure to close off, or at least guard, the emergency access route to Magdeburg Alter Markt that allowed him to allegedly drive his BMW into the crowds.\n\nGerman authorities have defended the market's layout and said an investigation into the suspect's past is ongoing.\n\nBut a complicating factor here is that Saudi Arabia, although considered a friend and ally of the West, has a poor human rights record.\n\nUntil June 2018 Saudi women were forbidden to drive and even those women who publicly called for that ban to be lifted before then have been persecuted and imprisoned.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, still only in his 30s, just, is immensely popular in his own country.",

Among them is Tony Chung, the former leader of a pro-independence group who fled to the UK last year. The group - which includes a former district councillor, an actor, and a YouTuber - have been lobbying for more democracy in the territory. All have been accused of violating the city's national security law. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticised the move, calling on Hong Kong authorities to \"end their targeting of individuals in the UK and elsewhere who stand up for freedom and democracy\".\n\n\"We will not tolerate any attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas, especially in the UK,\" he said, adding that the UK government was committed to supporting those from Hong Kong who have relocated to the UK. Also on the wanted list is former district councillor Carmen Lau and activist Chloe Cheung. Both are based in the UK and lobby on behalf of two NGOs calling for more democracy in Hong Kong. Arrest warrants were also issued for political commentator and pollster Chung Kim-wah, who left Hong Kong for the UK in 2022, as well as two people based in Canada: former actor Joseph Tay, who co-founded the NGO HongKonger Station, and Youtuber Victor Ho. Mr Ho has been charged with subversion while the other six have been accused inciting secession and collusion with a foreign country or external forces. According to Hong Kong's public broadcaster RTHK, the arrest warrants were announced by the city's top police chiefs on Tuesday, who accused some of the wanted activists of repeatedly requesting foreign countries to impose sanctions and other measures against China and Hong Kong. Mr Chung was first convicted in 2021 for calling for Hong Kong's secession and was released in June last year. He posted on Instagram on Tuesday that it was \"an honour to become the first Hongkonger to be charged twice under the National Security Law\". Mr Chung said the news came as no surprise to him as he breached a supervision order after his release from prison by fleeing to the UK last year. \"I knew this day would come. From the moment I decided to leave Hong Kong, I was fully aware that I would not be able to return for a long time,\" he wrote. Mr Chung confirmed to the BBC that he was still waiting for his asylum application to be approved by the UK government.\n\nGetty Images Carmen Lau is also based in the UK and has been calling for more democracy in Hong Kong",

    "body": "Global plastic talks collapse as oil states rebel\n\n1 December 2024 Share Save Esme Stallard Climate and science reporter, BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images More than nine billion tonnes of plastic has been produced globally with less than 10% recycled\n\nCountries have failed to reach a landmark agreement on tackling plastic pollution after more than two years of negotiations. More than 200 nations met in South Korea for what was meant to be a final round of talks. But deep divisions remained between a group of nearly 100 \"high ambition\" countries calling for plastic to be phased out and oil-producing nations who warned this would affect the world's development. \"The objective of this treaty is to end plastic pollution not plastic itself, plastic has brought immense benefit to societies worldwide,\" said the Kuwait negotiators in the final hours.\n\nIn 2022, the world's nations agreed that a global treaty was needed to tackle the issue of plastic pollution particularly the impacts on the marine environment - and this should be completed within two years given the urgency of the issue. Since 1950, more than eight billion tonnes of plastic have been produced globally but less than 10% has been recycled, estimates the United Nations. This has led to millions of tonnes entering the world's oceans and seas, posing serious risks to wildlife and their environment. Birds, fish and whales can become injured or killed if they become entangled in plastic debris or mistakenly ingest it, leading to starvation. Plastic is also produced from fossil fuels, and is currently estimated to be responsible for 5% of global emissions - so efforts to restrict it could also help with efforts to tackle climate change. The meeting in Busan, South Korea, was meant to be the final fifth round of negotiations but after late night talks countries were unable to resolve their differences missing their key two-year deadline. \"A few critical issues prevent us from reaching a comprehensive agreement,\" said the talks' chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso on Sunday - the final day of talks. Although many issues are being discussed the key split is around Article 6 - whether there should be a commitment to cutting how much plastic is produced, or just try and reduce plastic waste by increasing efforts to recycle.\n\nA group of 95 countries have emerged, including the UK, European Union, African Group and many South American nations, who are calling for Article 6 to be a legally binding pledge to reduce production levels. \"We carry the weight of expectations of our citizens who are counting on us to protect them and the environment to protect it from the plastic pollution crisis,\" said Camila Zepeda, Mexico's chief negotiator, who spoke on behalf of this group at the final meeting. \"We must do everything in our power to meet this expectation.\" Her speech was meet with strong applause across the room, but a group of oil-producing nations including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and Russia pushed back strongly. The demand for oil across most sectors is expected to fall from 2026 as countries move to cleaner technologies like electric vehicles - but plastic is seen as one of the remaining growth markets. This may explain why these countries are particularly concerned about any global target to cut production levels. \"Attempting to phase out plastic rather than addressing the issue of plastic production risks undermining global progress and exacerbating economic inequality,\" said Salman Alajmi, a Kuwait delegate.\n\nGetty Images The amount of plastic entering the world's rivers and seas is expected to triple by 2040 at current rates of production\n\nIndia also voiced its concerns with including any commitments to cut production of plastic on the basis it could impact its right to development. Environmental charities and scientists expressed their deep disappointment that the talks had collapsed and raised concerns about the influence of the fossil fuel industry. InfluenceMap, a think tank, found that the petrochemical industry intervened dozens of times on the treaty via company statements, social media and consultation responses, and 93% of those were unsupportive of efforts to cut production levels. But the report did highlight that these efforts were outweighed by positive support from key manufacturers of plastic products like Unilever, Mars and Nestl\u00e9 who want consistent global regulation on the issue. Jodie Roussell, global public affairs lead for sustainability at Nestl\u00e9, said of the talks' collapse: \"Disappointingly, consensus among all nations remains elusive, which further delays critical action to end plastic pollution. \"It also fails to deliver the certainty that business needs to mobilise investment and scale solutions.\" It is now expected that countries will reconvene next year to try and get an agreement, but Eirik Lindebjerg, global plastics policy manager at conservation charity the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), told the BBC that the group of 95 should go ahead with their own treaty. \"I think the political reality is that most countries in the world want this \u2013 that is the positive thing we can take from this. \"Those countries shouldn\u2019t accept anything less than what they are asking for, there are already so many that a treaty would have a massive impact on ending plastic pollution and that option should be on the table.\"",

    "body": "MP calls for first-cousin marriage to be banned\n\n10 December 2024 Share Save Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nA Conservative former minister has called for first-cousin marriage to be banned in the UK. Introducing the proposals in Parliament, Richard Holden said the children of first cousins were at greater risk of birth defects and the practice should be prohibited to protect public health. However, independent MP Iqbal Mohamed argued a ban would be ineffective and said these issues would be better addressed through education programmes to raise awareness of the risks. Downing Street said the expert advice on the risks of first-cousin marriage was clear but indicated that the government had no plans to change the law.\n\n\"In terms of legislation, the government has set out its priorities,\" a No 10 spokesman said. Holden introduced his proposals using the 10-minute rule process, which allows a backbench MP to make the case for a new bill in a speech of up to 10 minutes in the Commons. However, such bills are unlikely to become law without government support because of the limited parliamentary time available for them. Under current legislation, marriages to a sibling, parent or child are prohibited but not between first cousins.\n\nHolden said that while the overall prevalence of first-cousin marriage was low in Western countries, certain diaspora communities, such as Irish travellers and British Pakistanis, had \"extremely high rates\" of 20-40%. The MP for Basildon and Billericay cited research suggesting the child of first cousins carries around double the risk of inheriting a serious disorder compared to the child or unrelated people. Holden also argued the practice threatened women's freedom. \"Women and girls living under a clan mentality often know the scientific risks of first-cousin marriage, but make considered social and cultural calculations,\" he told MPs. \"Strict honour codes, where expressions of individuality can be subject to social isolation, violence and even death in some cases, dominate thinking.\" He said first-cousin marriage was \"not really conducive to modern British society\", adding: \"It's about more than one marriage. It's about the values and foundations of our society and our democracy.\"",

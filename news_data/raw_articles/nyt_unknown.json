    "body": "Under $15\n\nCovergirl Clean Invisible Concealer had decent coverup, but only offered 12 shades.\n\nWhile E.L.F. 16HR Camo Concealer came in 24 hues at the time of testing, its oversized wand was unwieldy, and it had a powdery, dull finish.\n\nMakeup Revolution IRL Filter Finish Concealer had weak coverage, a streaky finish, and a narrow shade range.\n\nWe were let down by a drugstore-favorite, Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Multi-Use Concealer, which provided so-so coverage, dried cakey, and settled into fine lines. Its twisting sponge applicator was also a pain to use. And its shade range had big jumps, particularly frustrating our panelists with deeper skin tones.\n\n$16 to $34\n\nThe dry, very matte Benefit Boi-ing Cakeless Concealer was hard to move around and looked patchy on the skin.\n\nCharlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Radiant Concealer had a glimmering, light-reflecting finish, but also deposited teeny, glitter-like particulates across the skin.\n\nKnown for its inclusive shade range, Fenty Beauty We\u2019re Even Hydrating Longwear Concealer looked simultaneously dry and patchy under the eyes and shiny in the T-zone. Its white plastic top and tippy, angled bottom also looked cheap, given the price.\n\nSlick Glossier Stretch Balm Concealer seemed to highlight tiny under-eye bumps.\n\nThe too-big wand for Haus Labs Triclone Skin Tech Hydrating + De-puffing Concealer had to be tugged out and jammed back in the tube, and the formula caked.\n\nEven though Ilia True Skin Serum Concealer slid on easily, it dried with creasing.\n\nIronically, It Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye Concealer did a much better job at covering redness than under-eye circles. Distinctively thick and tacky, it was more challenging to blend, and its finish tended to be a bit shiny. While its shade range included 24 hues, it didn\u2019t increase gradually for deeper skin tones, and neither of our panelists on that end of the spectrum could find shades that matched them.\n\nBeloved for lighter skin tones, Laura Mercier Real Flawless Weightless Perfecting Concealer has smooth matte coverage, but its price per weight was high compared with similarly performing products.\n\nMany testers found that the lightweight Lanc\u00f4me Teint Idole Concealer required multiple layers for effective coverage, its applicator head was the \u201cbulkiest,\u201d and it didn\u2019t have much staying power.\n\nNatural-looking Make Up For Ever HD Concealer had solid, buildable coverage, but it was not exceptional enough to justify its high price versus other concealers that we advanced to panel testing.\n\nMilk Makeup Future Fluid Concealer had a tacky, difficult-to-spread consistency and a powdery, drying finish.\n\nThe thick consistency of Nars Soft Matte Complete Concealer required more-expert makeup application, and most panelists found the mattifying effects emphasized creases. But it was the favorite of a 20-something with combo skin who loved the texture and found that it \u201ctoned down oiliness.\"\n\nPat McGrath Labs Skin Fetsh: Sublime Perfection Full Coverage Concealer had a thick formula that covered redness quite well, but it was also slightly drying and quite pricey for its weight.\n\nEven though Tarte Shape Tape Full-Coverage Concealer was the most full coverage in its line, which also includes medium-coverage and creamy variants, panelists found it didn\u2019t cover under-eye circles particularly well. And its sticky consistency tended to cake for most testers. It did, however, effectively cover a birthmark in one layer.\n\nCreamy Tower 28 Swipe Serum Concealer provided solid under-eye coverage, and most testers appreciated the doe-foot applicator\u2019s flexibility and tiny head, but it didn\u2019t perform well in obscuring redness.\n\n$35 and up\n\nThe glamorous Armani Beauty Luminous Silk Hydrating & Brightening Concealer had a glimmering finish that just looked expensive, but its longevity was \u201cmediocre.\u201d And one of our testers was very frustrated that Armani didn\u2019t offer deeper shades in more undertone options.\n\nA cult-favorite and go-to for supervising beauty editor Hannah Morrill, Cl\u00e9 de Peau Concealer SPF 27 provides excellent matte coverage in a single swipe. But its sky-high price and limited shade range kept it from advancing to panel testing.\n\nThough Givenchy Prisme Libre Skin-Caring Concealer and pricier-by-weight Est\u00e9e Lauder Futurist Soft Touch Brightening Skincealer both blended smoothly and provided good coverage, they also creased or settled into fine lines for half of our panelists as the day progressed. Many also found the Givenchy concealer\u2019s larger applicator head to be clunky.\n\nEncased in a \u201csexy\u201d frosted, tapered bottle, Hourglass Vanish Airbrush Concealer knocked it out of the park in longevity and coverage for all targeted areas. But panelists balked when asked if they\u2019d buy it themselves.\n\nFor no-makeup makeup girlies, dewy RMS Beauty UnCoverup Concealer did indeed leave a glowy finish, but the price per weight was quite high.\n\nToo Faced Born This Way Super Coverage Multi-Use Concealer had a tacky, difficult-to-spread consistency and also slightly emphasized skin texture.\n\nMore of a highlighter, exorbitantly priced Yves St Laurent Touche \u00c9clat Awakening Concealer Click Pen doesn\u2019t offer much coverage, and its click-pen applicator took a lot of clicking to get going and then released too much product all at once.\n\nThis article was edited by Hannah Morrill and Jennifer Hunter.",

    "title": "The Best Tablecloths",
    "body": "We focused only on tablecloths made from natural fibers. The most common and affordable natural-fiber table linens are made from cotton. Prices vary depending on the quality of the fiber, the construction, and sometimes the name brand. Cotton linens generally have the smooth, polished look of tablecloths you\u2019d see in a fine-dining restaurant.\n\nLinen is also a great material for tablecloths. Made from the fibers of the flax plant, linen is absorbent and has a more-relaxed drape than cotton. Threads spun from flax fibers are thicker than cotton, and the result is the distinct, visible woven texture that linen goods are known for.\n\nQuality craftsmanship and thoughtful details separate good tablecloths from great ones. Hems with clean, straight stitching and minimal puckering are a sign of a well-made product. Deep hems measuring at least 1 inch and mitered corners on square or rectangular shapes add weight to the drape and give tablecloths a polished drop. But round and oval tablecloths should be finished with a narrower hem, about \u00bc inch or \u215c inch, to avoid puckering.\n\n\u201cPuckering\u201d describes the little ripples that appear along the hemline of a tablecloth after it\u2019s laundered. This can happen if the fabric and thread shrink at different rates, the stitch tension is too tight, or the fabric wasn\u2019t laundered before sewing. All of the tablecloths we\u2019ve tested have puckered at various rates, but the worst offenders came out of the wash with rippled and fluttered hems that were impossible to iron flat.\n\nWe looked for tablecloths that are available in multiple sizes and shapes. Dining tables come in many sizes and shapes (square, rectangle, oval, and square). We set out to find the most attractive, high-quality tablecloths that come in a variety of cuts and dimensions.\n\nMeasure your dining table, and then add 20 to 24 inches to the length to account for an appropriate drop. Or you can use this Williams Sonoma chart. Keep in mind that all table linens made from natural fibers will shrink after laundering, about 5% in length and 3% in width. So if you\u2019re worried about a tablecloth\u2019s drop becoming too short after laundering, be safe and go up a size.\n\nTo test durability, we washed, dried, and pressed the tablecloths with a steam iron. We examined the fabric for pilling and the hems for puckering and fraying. We also measured each piece to gauge shrinkage after laundering. Any natural-fiber tablecloth will shrink some after the first wash.\n\nWe also looked at how attractive they were while in use. We draped the tablecloths over countertops, desks, and tables to examine the drape and drop of each one.",

    "body": "Michael Murtaugh/NYT Wirecutter Michael Murtaugh/NYT Wirecutter; prop styling by Andrea Bonin Michael Murtaugh/NYT Wirecutter\n\nVanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer is a go-to for dermatologists and sensitive skin types alike, thanks to its blend of humectants, such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin, and emollients, like ceramides and squalane. It absorbs readily, leaves skin plumped, and even softens the appearance of fine lines, however temporarily. The packaging isn\u2019t charming, but none of our testers could deny its efficacy.\n\nIt boasts no-nonsense ingredients. While many of the moisturizers we considered had more than 50 ingredients, Vanicream moisturizer\u2019s lean and mean 19 includes the derm-anointed all-stars we looked for: squalane, glycerin, glycol, hyaluronic acid, and five different ceramides. Also, it notably lacks common chemical irritants like fragrances, dyes, lanolin, parabens, and formaldehyde releasers. The fine-tuned ingredient panel leaves little room for irritation, and none of our eight testers\u2014even those with sensitive skin\u2014reported any issues.\n\nThe packaging is dismal, but the texture is sublime. Inside the meh plastic tube is an absolutely breathtaking formula. \u201cThe silky texture could easily pass for Chanel,\u201d noted one panelist, who even considered decanting it into a more vanity-worthy jar. Medium-weight and highly emollient, the cream glides on effortlessly, absorbs beautifully, and works well under makeup (several options we tested, like one from EltaMD, either pilled or repelled cosmetics). Most compellingly, it leaves our skin softer than moisturizers costing 10 times as much.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to work this cream into a skin-care routine. Even panelists who didn\u2019t have sensitive skin appreciated Vanicream moisturizer for another reason: its layerability. A tester working a prescription tretinoin back into her routine after pregnancy found it was an ideal base layer to prevent the initial skin flare-up she was expecting. Some of the creams we tested had nearly a hundred ingredients, like Cl\u00e9 de Peau (84). More ingredients means more chances for reactivity, especially when paired with compounds like vitamin C, retinol, and alpha hydroxy acids (AHA). Vanicream moisturizer keeps it basic, in the best way.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers",

    "body": "Michael Murtaugh/NYT Wirecutter; food styling by Maggie Ruggiero\n\nPlain potato chips\n\nMost of our panel liked Herr\u2019s Crisp \u2019N Tasty Potato Chips for their golden color and good potato flavor but found them to be blander and less light and crispy than some of our picks.\n\n365 by Whole Foods Organic Sea Salt Potato Chips had an earthy potato flavor most tasters liked, but not as much as our picks. They looked earthy, too: large, flat, pale chips with a wisp of potato skin at the edges.\n\nSal de Ibiza Chips from Spain were one of the only imported chips our panel liked. These large, sunny chips had a great flavor and were very crispy, but most felt they were just a little too greasy.\n\nMost tasters liked these smaller, thin and crunchy Market Pantry Classic Potato Chips made for Target but didn\u2019t consider them a favorite, noting that they had a slightly darker flavor and color than many of our picks and a slightly more oily flavor.\n\nMost tasters really liked Lay\u2019s Classic Potato Chips, noting a big crunch and balanced salt-and-potato flavor, but several noted the taste felt subdued compared with that of our picks.\n\nWalker\u2019s Legendary Ready Salted Potato Chips, imported from the United Kingdom, garnered a very similar reaction. (Both brands are owned by PepsiCo.)\n\nWe liked the potato flavor of Wise Snacks Golden Original Potato Chips\u2014darker-brown chips that are on the smaller side and salty\u2014but they were a little oilier than most.\n\nHerr\u2019s Crisp \u2019N Tasty Potato Chips had a nice, toasted, oven-fried potato flavor, but the salt was unevenly applied.\n\nSome tasters thought Trader Joe\u2019s Ode to the Classic Potato Chip were pale and tasted slightly stale, though they had a nutty, balanced flavor and snappy texture.\n\nOur panel found that Old Dutch Original Potato Chips had a dense, too-dry texture and some vegetal off-flavors, and they needed more salt.\n\nMartin\u2019s Sea Salted Potato Chips are made with shortening instead of vegetable oil, and our panel did not like their starchy, powdery texture. A few tasters also noticed bitter off-flavors.\n\nTasters did not like Whole Foods Organic potato chips, which had some green spots in addition to thicker pieces of potato peel, and stale, rancid flavors.\n\nBoth Gibble\u2019s Original Potato Chips and Kay & Ray\u2019s Premium Potato Chips, also made by Gibble\u2019s, are fried in lard, and even tasters that like our old-fashioned picks found the aftertaste of the animal fat unpleasant.\n\nMiddleswarth Potato Chips are also made with lard. Several tasters liked these chips but said that the flavor, reminiscent of fast-food french fries, wasn\u2019t suited to a plain potato chip.\n\nWe dismissed Better Made Special Original Potato Chips, which had an unpleasantly strong oil flavor that was almost porky, even though they are not made with lard.\n\nSterzing\u2019s Potato Chips, a regional brand from Iowa, tasted like older, musty oil.\n\nSnyder of Berlin Original Potato Chips were light and crisp, though some tasters found the oil a little rancid.\n\nThe batch of Spain\u2019s Bonilla a La Vista chips we tried had rancid oil flavors, which surprised us\u2014multiple tasters on the panel had tried these beautiful, sunny chips in the past and loved them. We recommend them in several gift guides for that reason and for the fun factor of receiving a big tin of chips as a gift. But because of the potential for stale chips, we couldn\u2019t make them a pick in this guide.\n\nTorres Extra Virgin Olive Oil potato chips had rancid, off-flavors. We also sampled Torres Selecta Mediterranean Sea Salt chips, which tasted bland and stale. But our tasters thought both looked beautiful.\n\nSuperbon Chips de Madrid from Spain and San Carlo Classic Potato Chips from Italy were also bland and stale, with starchy aftertastes.\n\nWe had wanted to try Clover Valley Classic Potato Chips, sold at Dollar General, and Snack Day Original Potato Chips, sold at Aldi, but both were out of stock during our tasting. And chips from Charles Chips arrived too late for us to include them in our test.\n\nKettle-style potato chips\n\nWe liked the toasty, deep-fried flavor and light texture of Clancy\u2019s Original Kettle Chips, which had savory, almost meaty overtones, but we didn\u2019t find them to be as appealing as our top picks.\n\nMost tasters found Zapp\u2019s New Orleans Kettle Style Regular Flavor chips to be nicely crunchy and balanced in flavor, if somewhat average.\n\nGreat Value Kettle Cooked Original Potato Chips were a nice golden brown and very crunchy, with a fried potato flavor similar to that of fast-food french fries. But some found that flavor lingered too long.\n\nA few tasters liked the heavy crunch and savory, oily flavor of Tim\u2019s Cascade Snacks Cascade Style Potato Chips with Sea Salt, but several thought these dark-tan chips had lingering flavors that were borderline unpleasant.\n\nUtz Kettle Classics Original were a little on the oily side but fresh-tasting and light, with good potato flavor. But some thought they were too soft.\n\nMy Dad\u2019s Chips Homestyle Potato Chips were polarizing. Some tasters absolutely loved this chip\u2019s dark russet color, extra saltiness, deep crunch, oily sheen, and toasty, long-fried flavor, especially with dip. Others felt they were a little too salty.\n\nThe darkly fried, oily Good & Gather Kettle Cooked Sea Salt Potato Chips reminded tasters of latkes, but several thought they tasted overcooked, or even slightly bitter.\n\nMiss Vickie\u2019s Sea Salt Chips were also among the darkest chips we tasted. Though they had good flavor and texture, we found them to be too greasy, and some chips tasted stale.\n\nWe did not enjoy Kettle Brand Sea Salt Potato Chips, which tasted stale and even scorched, with a strong aftertaste and unpleasant mouthfeel.\n\nWe appreciated the mission of Uglies Sea Salt Kettle Potato Chips\u2014to use potatoes rejected for use by other chip makers\u2014but did not love the end results. Some chips had unpleasant earthy, stale, or moldy flavors and a strong aftertaste of green potato.\n\nCape Cod Kettle Cooked Potato Chips Original had a sweet-potato flavor and greasy crunch that many liked, but some tasted scorched oil.\n\nMartin\u2019s Kettle Cook\u2019d Hand Cooked Potato Chips are fried in shortening instead of vegetable oil, and our panel did not like their bitter off-flavors and softer texture.\n\nWe mostly liked Dirty Kettle Style Potato Chips, which are golden brown and taste and feel a little oily. The flavor wasn\u2019t hugely potatoey, but the chips were satisfying. Although, a few found they had a slightly unpleasant aftertaste.\n\nKettle-style Pipers Angelsley Sea Salt Crisps were oily yet bland, and undersalted.\n\nWise Snacks New York Deli Kettle Cooked Potato Chips were noticeably harder than other chips, which many tasters didn\u2019t like, and on the oily side. The potato flavor was earthy and toasty, though some tasters detected a stale or even fishy aftertaste.\n\nWe did not like 365 by Whole Foods Market Sea Salt Kettle Chips, which were stale, lacking in flavor, and strangely hard.\n\nWe also did not like Siete Kettle Cooked Potato Chips, which are fried in avocado oil. Tasters noted they tasted like dirt, plastic, or scorched oil, were too soft, and had a bad aftertaste.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s Kettle Cooked Olive Oil Potato Chips also tasted of scorched oil and had an unpleasant buttery aftertaste.\n\nGreat Lakes Potato Chip Co. Kettle Cooked Original Potato Chips had a good flavor and were super crunchy, but some found they had starchy notes that were unpleasant.\n\nHal\u2019s New York Kettle Chips Original Sea Salt were pale and stale, and several chips also had flecks of green potato, which tend to taste bad.\n\nNorth Fork Potato Chips were also small, pale, and stale.\n\nWe did not like Rusty\u2019s Chips Sea Salt Potato Chips. Dark orange, and extremely oily, they tasted stale and were thick and dry.\n\nWe had wanted to taste Clover Valley Original Kettle Potato Chips, sold at Dollar General, but they were out of stock during our tasting.\n\nWavy and rippled chips\n\nTasters thought Ruffles Original had great flavor, a good crunch, and stood up to dipping, but they were not as well-liked as our picks. They\u2019re also very salty.\n\nUtz Ripples Original Potato Chips and Utz Wavy Original Potato Chips were well balanced, with a good salt level, sturdiness, and potato flavor, but some said they were subtler than our picks.\n\nHerr\u2019s Ripples Potato Chips (which have a wider wave) and Herr\u2019s Ridged Potato Chips were also very good, but with a flatter flavor than our pick. Herr\u2019s Kettle Cooked Classic Lattice Cut with Sea Salt potato chips, on the other hand, were too oily and thick.\n\nClancy\u2019s Wavy Potato Chip, made for Aldi supermarkets, had a great texture but were starchy and tasted undercooked.\n\nWe did not like Kirkland Signature Kettle Brand Pink Salt Potato Chips, made for Costco. They were greasy, hard, and bland, and they tasted slightly underdone.\n\nWe did not like Boulder Canyon Classic Sea Salt Kettle Style Potato Chips, which are fried in avocado oil. The oil tasted stale and bitter.\n\nWe had wanted to taste Clover Valley Ripple Cut Potato Chips, sold at Dollar General, and Amazon Fresh Wavy Potato Chips, but both were out of stock during our tasting.",

    "title": "One Bed, Two Blankets: How My Husband and I Stopped Fighting Over the Covers at Night",
    "body": "My husband\u2019s side of the bed (left) and mine (right). He sleeps with a lightweight blanket, while I prefer a heavy comforter. Elissa Sanci/NYT Wirecutter\n\nI admit that I\u2019ve been a cover hog my entire life, but it\u2019s not (totally) my fault. I move a lot in my sleep\u2014which I can\u2019t control\u2014so I\u2019d often swaddle myself in our shared blanket throughout the night, leaving my husband out in the cold. Getting the covers back was never easy for him, and on the nights I went to bed earlier than he did, he\u2019d have to wrestle them free, sometimes waking me in the process.\n\nThe morning I woke up wrapped in our shared comforter, warm and cozy, only to see him shivering under a too-small throw blanket usually reserved for the couch, I felt like an absolute jerk and decided it was time to find a solution. That\u2019s when I finally suggested to my husband that we sleep with separate blankets.\n\nMy husband happily welcomed this new arrangement. We agreed that if we didn\u2019t like the separation and wanted to be under the same blanket again, we\u2019d simply switch back. But after just one night of sleeping the Scandinavian way, we knew we were on to something.\n\n\u201cThe Scandinavian sleeping method allows you to create a sleep environment that works for you,\u201d explains James Wilson, a sleep practitioner and educator based in the UK. This is especially helpful if you and your partner have different body temperatures, as my husband and I do. \u201cAs sleepers, we\u2019re all different, so if we\u2019re trying to buy a comforter that suits everyone in the bed, we often end up with one person being too hot or too cold.\u201d\n\nSleeping Scandi-style solved our temperature differences literally overnight. With the freedom to personalize our respective sides of the bed with bedding that complemented our individual temperatures, we both immediately slept more comfortably. My husband, who runs hot, prefers to sleep in as little as possible, under a paper-thin blanket, while I\u2019d rather wear a full sweatsuit with socks to bed and wrap myself, burrito-style, in a fluffy feather-down comforter. Before adopting the Scandi method, we\u2019d always bicker over the bedding, eventually compromising with a blanket somewhere in the middle that neither of us actually liked. Now, we each sleep exactly how we want with the bedding we prefer.\n\nCreating a sleeping environment that\u2019s right for you in terms of comfort, support, and temperature is likely to improve the quality of your sleep, explains Wilson. It has certainly helped my husband and me sleep more soundly throughout the night, especially now that one of us isn\u2019t left out in the cold night after night.",

But the slippery formula didn\u2019t wow us for everyday use, and some testers experienced a stinging sensation when using it.\n\nAlthough Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion was a top pick in the previous version of this guide, the current crop of panelists said the formula was lighter and less effective than other contenders; most found the hydrating benefits much too short-lived.\n\nWe found Eucerin Intensive Repair, which counts mineral oil as its first ingredient, to be too greasy and unpleasant to use. (We also disliked the smell, which one tester described as reminiscent of old milk.) The same was true for Nivea Essentially Enriched, which had the consistency, look, and feel of an especially greasy sunscreen.\n\nWe\u2019ve used Palmer\u2019s Daily Skin Therapy many times in the past for extra-dry skin needs, but our testers found the consistency too greasy to recommend for everyday use. In addition, the formula tended to sit on, not sink into, flaky skin.\n\nWe were extremely frustrated by the pump dispenser for La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ Triple Repair Moisturizing Cream\u2014the thick formula seemed almost impossible to get out of the bottle.\n\nWe liked the richness and texture of Kiehl\u2019s Creme de Corps but were slightly put off by its smell, color, and oiliness.\n\nWe tested Brazilian Bum Bum Cream based on its rave reviews but found the formula\u2019s hydration to be much too fleeting\u2014and its tub way too small\u2014for any sort of effective daily habit. Similarly, Eos Shea Better 24H Moisture Body Lotion had all the hype (and a great price), but we weren\u2019t wowed by its slightly greasy, less hydrating formula.\n\nAs a luxe option, Fenty Beauty\u2019s Butta Drop Whipped Oil Body Cream was just okay texture-wise, and the scent was too subtle to register after a short while. We found that the similarly priced Josie Maran Whipped Argan Oil Body Butter (which comes in both scented and unscented options) offered a much better experience for the money.\n\nSome testers loved the scent of Weleda Skin Food Body Butter, and some found it overwhelming. Ultimately, it was the butter\u2019s oily top layer and waxy, congealed texture that kept it off our list of picks.\n\nInexpensive mainstays Gold Bond Healing Hydrating Lotion and Jergens Ultra Healing Dry Skin Moisturizer both had formulas that we found too clumpy, and for one tester the Gold Bond pump broke after one use.\n\nBoth CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion (a former runner-up pick) and Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion had formulas that we found too light for remedying dry skin; we preferred the CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Cream formula instead.\n\nFor all of its fancy holographic packaging, we found the thin formula of Olay Collagen Peptide Firming Body Lotion to be extremely underwhelming.\n\nAlthough Tree Hut Vanilla Whipped Shea Body Butter is an inexpensive body butter, we thought its cold, jelly-like texture was unappealing.\n\nThis article was edited by Hannah Morrill and Jennifer Hunter.

    "title": "Do You Use a Humidifier or Diffuser Before Bedtime? You Might Want to Stop.",
    "body": "A humidifier can be a useful tool to support health, said Juanita Mora, a physician and spokesperson for the American Lung Association. \u201cBut we also have to make sure that it\u2019s cleaned at least once a week [and] the water\u2019s changed daily so that we avoid adding more indoor pollutants to our environment by turning on this humidifier,\u201d explained Mora.\n\nWash humidifiers with soap weekly\n\nStaff writer Thom Dunn, who wrote Wirecutter\u2019s guide to the best humidifiers, recommends cleaning the device weekly or any time you notice white scale or film, as well as after pulling it from storage. (That\u2019s why cleaning was a big part of testing humidifiers for our guide.)\n\nSeriously: Do it once a week. This is no laughing matter; the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued an alert about dirty humidifiers and possible health hazards, which can range from \u201cflu-like symptoms to serious infection.\u201d\n\nWe have a whole article about cleaning humidifiers, but soap and water is the safest option, said Maryum Merchant, a pulmonologist at UCLA Health who co-leads the Adult Asthma Program, in a phone interview. She said diluted white vinegar can also be used safely, but she discouraged the use of bleach, even when diluted.\n\nThe CDC states that soap and water are typically sufficient to clean surfaces. If you do use bleach to clean a particularly nasty humidifier, Thom recommends bringing the humidifier outside and running a full tank of water through it after you\u2019ve finished cleaning, to make sure none of the dangerous chemicals stick around.\n\n\u201cDo not use chemical cleaning agents or disinfectants, as they can remain in the humidifier and be volatilized next time the humidifier is used,\u201d said Andrea Dietrich, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who co-authored a paper on humidifier use and indoor air quality.\n\nUse distilled water and change it daily\n\nThe CPSC recommends changing the water in your humidifier once a day. On top of that, as Merchant, Mora, and other experts recommend, you should use distilled water\u2014that is, water without any minerals\u2014in an ultrasonic humidifier. Distilled water excludes tap water, even when it\u2019s been filtered or purified.\n\nThat\u2019s because studies show that when filled with mineral water or tap water, even when it\u2019s been filtered, ultrasonic humidifiers in particular can send small particles of dried minerals, like calcium and magnesium, into the air. Those minerals aren\u2019t inherently harmful (in fact, they\u2019re important nutrients), but they\u2019re not healthy when inhaled into the lungs.\n\n\u201cWhen dried mineral particles containing calcium and magnesium are inhaled into the lungs, this is not good for health, as particles can clog the lung passages, making breathing difficult,\u201d said Dietrich, who co-authored one such study, by email. There is also a risk that the mineral dust could contain metals like arsenic, cadmium, lead, and manganese, she said.\n\n\u201cInhaling particles has worse consequences for children than adults because children inhale a greater volume of air per body weight than adults,\u201d Dietrich said.\n\nIn contrast to ultrasonic humidifiers, steam or evaporative humidifiers circumvent the possibility of aerosolizing minerals\u2014but steam types can pose burn hazards and may not be a good idea if you have young children or pets. And they too need to be cleaned routinely.\n\nMonitor moisture\n\n\u201cDepending on your home, raising the humidity in a room can also lead to growth of microbes,\u201d said Hayley Goldbach, a dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon at Brown University, in an email. \u201cFor someone with asthma, this can be a serious trigger.\u201d\n\nGenerally speaking, optimal humidity levels for your home are between 30% and 50%, said Mora.\n\nThe EPA recommends keeping humidity levels indoors within 50%. If you do use a humidifier regularly, it\u2019s a good idea to monitor your indoor humidity, said Mora; devices that measure this, called hygrometers, are available at hardware stores (we suggest an inexpensive option in our dehumidifier guide).\n\nYou should also take care to keep the area around the humidifier dry, including walls and other vertical surfaces, to prevent mold and mildew growth within building materials, said Jeffrey Siegel, a professor of civil and mineral engineering at the University of Toronto, in a phone interview.\n\nBe cautious with scents\n\nIf you\u2019re in the habit of running your humidifier with essential oils (which some models let you do) or using an essential oil diffuser that relies on mist, here are some things you may want to consider.\n\nResearch on the possible benefits of essential oils is ongoing. But when it comes to scent diffusers, you should proceed with extra caution: Aromatherapy essential oils aren\u2019t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration or the CPSC. Essential oils may emit potentially hazardous VOCs into the air. Experts say you should never use essential oil diffusers around infants under 6 months old; for ages above that, discuss with your doctor what essential oils may be okay to use.\n\nHow much you put into your diffuser, and how much you dilute it, will vary and is hard to measure. And if your space is poorly ventilated (a small bedroom with the windows closed in winter, say), the concentration of oils in the air you breathe can climb quite high, said Merchant.\n\nPeople are still studying the safety of inhaling essential oils long-term. However, one study suggests that heavy exposure, as in several hours a day over many years, could potentially have health effects. More immediately, essential oils might trigger an asthma attack in some individuals, according to the American Lung Association. If you have asthma, it\u2019s a good idea to proceed with caution, as we suggest in our guide to the best essential oil diffusers.\n\nRemember, if you use an essential oil diffuser, clean it regularly, fill it with distilled water, and don\u2019t keep it running on your bedside table as you fall asleep. Let it run for as short a time as possible, and far from your head.\n\nEssential oils can also be hazardous to pets or otherwise impact their health, said Amy Nichelason, a veterinarian and professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in an email. \u201cOverall, I don\u2019t recommend essential oil diffusers, especially in environments where my patients\u201d\u2014that is, dogs and cats\u2014\u201chave any form of respiratory disease like asthma,\u201d she explained. She recommends using them only in areas that your pet can\u2019t access.",

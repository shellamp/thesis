    "title": "Southwest Airlines shareholders puzzled by Elliott's activism can look to past campaigns for insight",
    "body": "In this article LUV\n\nSU\n\nMPC Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nTravelers wait to check in at the Southwest Airlines counter at Oakland International Airport in Oakland, California, Dec. 27, 2022. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nAfter Elliott Management revealed a $1.9 billion stake in Southwest Airlines in June, an initial rally in the stock quickly fizzled. Rather than sparking typical cheer on Wall Street, Elliott's campaign, spelled out in a 50-page presentation, led to confusion and concern among investors and customers. The hedge fund has taken activist stakes in more than 140 companies over the past three decades, according to data from 13D Monitor, but, like most activist investors, it has never targeted an airline. Southwest, a Dallas-based company that started flying in 1971, has a unique culture that's survived profitably for decades in a bruising industry. While the company is suffering from margin deterioration and has seen its stock drop in each of the past four years, Elliott's demand that Southwest fire CEO Bob Jordan and oust Chairman Gary Kelly has raised questions about whether the activist fully understands Southwest's insular culture and the industry's glacial pace of change. Elliott hasn't publicly specified changes it wants within Southwest's offerings, calling instead for a business review. \"We are not entirely sure what Elliott has in mind,\" analysts at Melius Research wrote in a report on June 10, the day the firm launched its campaign. \"Until we know more, we are sticking with our Sell rating.\" Southwest has taken steps to defend itself. On Wednesday, the airline adopted a so-called poison pill that would activate if any shareholder acquired an interest of more than 12.5%, limiting Elliott's ability to attain more control. Elliott says it currently has an interest of about 11% of the company. Despite the potential wrinkle introduced by Southwest's latest move, history offers some clues as to how this will play out. Several activism experts pointed to two of Elliott's past targets for insight into the hedge fund's strategy for Southwest: Suncor Energy in 2022 and Marathon Petroleum in 2019. Elliott partner John Pike, who is now leading the Southwest campaign, was involved in the firm's actions at both energy companies. While Suncor and Marathon resisted Elliott's proposals, including leadership change and business reviews, Elliott still got much of what it wanted.\n\nwatch now\n\nElliott's activist practice has helped it become one of the most successful hedge funds in the world, surpassing $65 billion in assets. The firm, which moved its headquarters in 2020 from New York to West Palm Beach, Florida, has only had two losing years in five decades. It often pushes companies to make dramatic changes, such as selling off businesses, firing executives or abandoning strategic plans. In recent years, however, Elliott has also shown it can work collaboratively with management. Representatives have joined the boards of companies including Pinterest and Etsy . Texas Instruments CEO Haviv Ilan said in May that his company was open to \"constructive dialogue\" with Elliott, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he had \"thoroughly enjoyed getting to know\" the Elliott team after the firm dropped plans to nominate directors at the software company in 2023. Southwest said in a brief response to Elliott's presentation that it's \"thoughtfully reviewing\" the June 10 letter from the hedge fund and looks forward to \"further conversations with Elliott.\" Southwest also said it's confident in its strategy and its team and is \"focused on restoring our industry-leading financial performance.\" Jordan said he has no plans to resign. Pike and portfolio manager Bobby Xu are leading Elliott's Southwest campaign. Elliott and Southwest representatives met in person in Dallas two weeks ago, according to people familiar with the matter. The discussions remain in the early stages, said the people, who asked not to be named because the conversations were private. The airline has tapped Bank of America and law firm Vinson & Elkins to advise it, another person familiar with the situation said. Southwest shares are down slightly since Elliott announced its involvement, despite a 7% jump on the day of the disclosure. They fell 5.7% on Friday to close at $26.94. Southwest did not provide a comment for this story.\n\nA sprint and Marathon\n\nwatch now\n\nIn April 2022, when Elliott revealed a stake in Suncor, it pointed to a culture that had become overly bureaucratic, leading to an operational slump and a string of worker deaths under CEO Mark Little. \"We have considerable respect for Suncor,\" Elliott's Pike wrote, in calling for management review. Investors were initially wary of Elliott's demands, which included selling off Suncor's Petro-Canada gas stations. Little pushed back initially, but his boardroom support evaporated when another worker was killed weeks after Elliott announced its stake. Little resigned, and the Canadian company soon struck a deal with Elliott, offering three board seats to the hedge fund and conceding to a strategic review \u2014 meaning a potential sale \u2014 of its Petro-Canada gas stations. It was a middle-of-the-road resolution. The company decided after the review not to sell its Petro-Canada business. But it also brought in as CEO an outsider, in longtime Exxon Mobil executive Rich Kruger. At Southwest, Elliott sees a top job that would be similarly appealing to industry executives from other airlines, according to a person familiar with the firm's thinking.\n\nA Suncor Energy facility in Sherwood Park, Alberta, Canada, Aug. 21, 2019. Candace Elliott | Reuters\n\nWhile its Suncor effort ended in a relatively quick victory, Elliott's experience with Marathon highlighted the firm's willingness to be patient. Elliott first amassed a stake in the oil producer in 2016 and asked Marathon to \"evaluate\" breaking up the company. Like Suncor, Marathon ran a review and opted to stay intact, keeping its Speedway gas stations as part of the business. But in 2018, a few months after reaching an agreement with Elliott, Marathon announced it was only getting bigger. The company agreed to buy rival Andeavor in a $23 billion deal. Elliott responded to what it viewed as a broken promise by reviving its activist campaign in 2019, picking up a new 2.5% position and proclaiming that it would make sure the \"right leadership\" was in place. \"While the Company assured shareholders that it was pursuing a full review of the Speedway business, it had a different agenda entirely,\" Elliott's Pike wrote in the 2019 letter. Weeks later, Marathon's board said CEO Gary Heminger would retire and that the company would finally spin off Speedway. Elliott reportedly insisted the board find an outsider to replace Heminger. In March 2020, Marathon hired 38-year industry veteran Mike Hennigan as CEO. Speedway was sold to 7-Eleven's parent company for $21 billion in 2020, months after Hennigan took the post, and the company later announced a $7.1 billion buyback program. Years after its victories at Marathon and Suncor, Elliott remains a top five shareholder at both companies.\n\nwatch now\n\nElliott is now one of the top investors in Southwest. One major shareholder, Artisan Partners , has expressed its support for Elliott's campaign. Southwest's bylaws allow big shareholders to call a special meeting to replace its board, something Elliott could consider doing further down the road, though the firm hasn't said if it plans to mount a proxy fight. Whether or not shareholders decide to back Elliott's push, history shows they will benefit. Elliott-targeted companies tend to outperform the market, according to a 13D Monitor analysis. The hedge fund holds on to its positions for two years on average, according to the data. Elliott said its plan can help Southwest's share price jump 77% in 12 months to $49. The poison pill Southwest introduced this week could complicate matters. It's normally adopted by companies fending off a takeover bid. In this case, it limits Elliott's ability to amass more control and also suggests that Southwest's management isn't interested in rolling over. In the press release announcing the plan, Kelly said the airline \"remains open to any ideas for lasting value creation\" but said adopting the poison pill was part of the board's \"fiduciary duties to all shareholders.\" The measure would allow all shareholders, \"other than the person or group triggering\" the plan, to buy stock at a 50% discount to the market price if any person or group acquired 12.5% or more of the company's outstanding stock. Elliott, which has dealt with poison pills in the past, hasn't made clear where it plans to go with its campaign. The firm isn't currently pursuing specific changes that would affect things such as Southwest's baggage policy, according to a person familiar with its plans. Southwest is the only domestic carrier that allows every passenger to check two bags for free, a major customer perk, particularly for those who fly with family members. But a refreshed board and business review could lead to scrutiny of some of Southwest's popular offerings.\n\nUnion challenges\n\nThere are some key differentiating factors for Southwest when compared with Suncor and Marathon. For one, Southwest hasn't made a notable acquisition since 2011 and doesn't have any adjacent businesses to spin out. Another potential hurdle is union influence, which makes it harder for management to implement significant changes, particularly when they involve layoffs and other cost cuts. More than 80% of Southwest's employees belong to a union, and there are separate organizations for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics. In all, workers are represented by at least 11 unions, according to the airline's website. Leadership from the 11,000-member Southwest Airlines Pilots Association met with the Elliott team in Dallas in June. The group conducted an \"in-depth analysis\" on Elliott's \"actionable plans and timelines,\" labor leaders said in a message obtained by CNBC. \"In very simple terms, this has the potential to be one of the most significant events in Southwest Airlines' history,\" SWAPA leaders wrote of the activist campaign. Southwest has previously acknowledged some of the problems Elliott highlighted, including system failures that led to thousands of cancellations and left millions of passengers stranded during the 2022 winter holidays. But financial challenges persist. Last week, Southwest cut its second-quarter revenue forecast. The company cited \"complexities in adapting\" its business to \"current booking patterns in this dynamic environment.\" According to Elliott, it's all part of a pattern that justifies activist intervention. \"Southwest is led by a team that has proven unable to adapt to the modern airline industry,\" Pike and Xu said in a statement. \"This is yet another example that fundamental leadership change is urgently needed at Southwest.\" \u2014 CNBC's Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Demonstrators take part in a rally against the far right following the announcement of the results of the first round of the French parliamentary elections at Place de la Republique in Paris on June 30, 2024. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\n\"We're scared of what might happen,\" Amel, 34, told CNBC ahead of the final round of voting in France's snap election this weekend. The vote is being closely watched by all quarters of French society to see if the nationalist, anti-immigration National Rally (RN) builds on its initial win in the first round of voting, or whether centrist and leftwing parties have been able to thwart the party's chances of entering government. \"It's a very, very tense time. And it's the first time that the far right is winning at the first turn [the first round of the ballot]. So it's a very big deal,\" Amel, a therapist who said she will vote for the leftwing New Popular Front, added. \"We are very anxious and we are trying to get everyone to vote, trying to tell people who don't vote to go and vote, and to try to convince people who vote for the extreme right that they are not a good answer [to France's problems].\" France's far-right RN rejects the \"extremist\" label, saying it stands up for French values, culture and citizens at a time when many are fed up with France's political establishment that's been led by President Emmanuel Macron since 2017. But RN's opponents and critics warn France is on the brink of a political catastrophe if an overtly anti-immigration, nationalist and euroskeptic party wins a majority in this snap election called by Macron after his party lost heavily against the hard-right in European Parliament elections in June. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has said French voters now have a \"moral duty\" to halt the party's advance. For young, left-leaning voters like Amel, RN's surge in voter polls, and the fact it won the most votes in the first round of the election last weekend, are worrying developments that make them fear for France's societal cohesion.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"I am worried about the country's future. I think it's getting worse and worse,\" Amel, who preferred to only give her first name due to the sensitive nature of the situation, said. \"It's going be like a kind of civil war. I hope it will not reach that, but people will just not mix anymore and will be scared of each other. And this is very scary.\" The snap election has thrown the country's political polarization into sharp relief as polls ahead of the final round of voting on Sunday imply a deeply divided nation. The first round of the election resulted in the far-right RN winning 33% of the vote, with the leftwing New Popular Front (NFP) garnering 28% and the coalition of parties supporting Macron (Ensemble, or Together) winning 20% of the vote.\n\nLeft wing supporters react as the results of the first round of French parliamentary elections are announced in Nantes, western France on June 30, 2024. Sebastien Salom-gomis | Afp | Getty Images\n\nSince the results of the first ballot, parties on the center-right and left have gone all-out to prevent RN's advance in the second ballot, aiming to prevent a parliamentary majority for the party at all costs. Joining forces in a so-called \"Republican Front,\" centrists and leftwing parties have withdrawn candidates in many constituencies where one of their candidates was better placed to beat the RN. By offering voters a starker choice and fewer options, the anti far-right front hopes that the electorate will vote for the non-RN candidate. Whether it will work remains to be seen and analysts point out that French voters might not take kindly to being directed how to vote, or who to vote for.\n\nThe elections are a 'mess'\n\nThe final result on Sunday evening \u2014 the outcome of a snap election Macron did not need to call \u2014 will show just how hard it could be to find a consensus in national politics and government going forward. How the nation will react to the result is also uncertain. France is no stranger to civil unrest given the widespread \"Yellow Vest\" anti-government movement of recent years, and street protests since the first round of voting on June 30. France's Interior Ministry appears to be preparing for more trouble after Sunday's poll, reportedly ready to deploy around 30,000 officers across France on Sunday night amid fears of violence after polls close. Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin is reported to have said 5,000 police would be on duty in Paris and its surrounding areas to \"ensure that the radical right and radical left do not take advantage of the situation to cause mayhem.\" France's police force has, at times, been accused of being heavy-handed with demonstrators during previous periods of unrest, firing water cannon and tear gas at \"yellow vest\" demonstrators in 2019.\n\n\n\nTension rises as demonstrators gather in Place de la Republique, to protest against the rising right-wing movement after the Rassemblement National's victory in the first round of early general elections in Paris, France on June 30, 2024. Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images\n\nA member of the gendarmerie, France's military force in charge of law enforcement and public order, told CNBC that the \"French elections are a mess\" and that the \"public divide has rarely been so flagrant in France.\" \"People's opinions are becoming more and more divided and this is felt in everyday life,\" the gendarme, who asked to remain anonymous due to the nature of his job, told CNBC. The officer \u2014 a father of three who's in his 40s, and a right-leaning voter \u2014 said the polarization in French society was \"very worrying, but unfortunately normal with the 'diversity' of our society.\" \"More and more people with different values and educations are being forced to co-exist, and this clearly doesn't work,\" the officer, who works in Bordeaux in southwestern France, said. \"I am worried about the country's future, because we are too generous to people who aren't willing to integrate and contribute to our society, this can not last.\" The police officer said he expected civil unrest after the vote, whichever party gained the most votes. \"There will be civil unrest whoever is elected, this is France and the people speak their mind.\"\n\nCivil unrest possible\n\nPolitical experts agree that the current febrile atmosphere of French politics, and antagonism between the main bodies of voters, are the ingredients for further civil unrest. \"You've got here all the recipe for a super-polarized political scene and that, of course, translates into civil society as a whole,\" Philippe Marli\u00e8re, professor of French and European politics at University College London, told CNBC. \"If you've got only 33-34% of people voting for the far-right it means the rest is wary of that, or completely opposed to it, so that will translate on every level of politics \u2014 institutional politics, party politics, the National Assembly, but also in society. You will have a very polarized society in which younger people, ethnic minorities, women, and in particular feminists, would be very worried,\" he said. Marli\u00e8re did not discount the possibility of violence on the streets if a far-right party was elected to government. \"We're not there yet. But if there are very unpopular, very antagonizing and very hostile policies to some groups, there will be demonstrations on a scale that you have unrest in the street,\" he said.\n\nUnknown entity\n\nLike other hard-right parties in Europe, the National Rally has tapped into voter insecurities regarding crime, immigration, national identity and economic insecurity. RN's 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella has told voters he will \"restore order,\" curb immigration and tackle delinquency but he and party figurehead Marine Le Pen have rowed back on some of their more strident promises and rhetoric, back-pedaling over taking France out of NATO, for example, and moderating the party's traditionally pro-Russian stance.

An opinion poll published by Ifop on July 3 suggested voters might tend toward a centrist pro-Macron or leftwing candidate rather than the RN candidate if that is the choice they are presented with on the ballot paper on Sunday. If the choice was between a far-left and far-right candidate, however, the picture was more nuanced, showing a split vote.\n\nwatch now",

    "title": "Nvidia CEO built a $3 trillion company with this leadership philosophy: \u2018No task is beneath me\u2019",
    "body": "A good leader can't be afraid to get their hands dirty, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nLong before he co-founded the computer chip giant, which is currently worth more than $3.1 trillion, Huang was a teenaged busboy working at Denny's. Years later, he would hatch the idea for Nvidia with his co-founders in a booth at the same Denny's where he'd once cleared tables, washed dishes and even cleaned toilets.\n\nDespite boasting a net worth that Forbes estimates at nearly $108 billion, Huang says those humble beginnings still shape the type of business leader he is today.\n\n\"To me, no task is beneath me because, remember, I used to be a dishwasher [and] I used to clean toilets,\" Huang said in a March interview at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\n\"I mean, I cleaned a lot of toilets,\" he added, telling a room full of students: \"I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined \u2014 and, some of them you just can't unsee.\"\n\nOf course, there's a big difference between being a teen restaurant employee and running a multitrillion-dollar company. But, Huang says he still tries to approach his job today with a similar willingness to take on anything if he believes he can help his employees improve the company, regardless of whether that task could be delegated to someone else.\n\n\"If you send me something and you want my input on it and I can be of service to you \u2014 and, in my review of it, share with you how I reasoned through it \u2014 I've made a contribution to you,\" Huang said.\n\nHuang is a famously hands-on boss, with some employees calling him \"demanding\" and a \"perfectionist.\" He asks employees across the company to email him each week with the five most important things they're working on, and then Huang sometimes even strolls up to employees' desks to ask them how projects are going and weigh in with suggestions, according to a profile in the New Yorker.\n\nWhenever possible, the longtime CEO likes to show his employees his reasoning for a suggestion or solution he offers. Doing so helps the company in the long run, and Huang also finds it personally rewarding and an opportunity to learn new things himself, he told the audience at Stanford.\n\n\"I show people how to reason through things all the time: strategy things, how to forecast something, how to break a problem down,\" he said. \"You're empowering people all over the place.\"\n\nHe tries to wrap up his most complicated work early in the day, so if anyone needs something from him the rest of the day, he can \"always say, 'I have plenty of time.' And I do,\" Huang said in a commencement speech at the California Institute of Technology last month.\n\nAnd, while many CEOs try to limit the number of people who directly report to them to a handful of employees to free up their management schedule, Huang actually prefers to have roughly \"50 direct reports,\" he told CNBC in November. That structure improves Nvidia's performance by allowing information and strategy to flow more directly between Huang and Nvidia's other leaders, according to Huang.\n\n\"The more direct reports a CEO has, the less layers are in the company. It allows us to keep information fluid,\" he said.\n\nIt's all about putting his employees in the best position to succeed and contribute to Nvidia's overall success, Huang said at Stanford. It is the job of any good CEO to \"lead other people to achieve greatness, inspire, empower other people, support other people,\" he added. \"Those are the reasons why the management team exists: in service of all of the other people that work in the company.\"\n\nWant to be a successful, confident communicator?

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: Presidential candidate Masoud Pezeshkian shows the victory sign during a campaign event in Tehran, Iran June 23, 2024. Majid Asgaripour | Via Reuters\n\nIran elected Masoud Pezeshkian to its presidency, in an unexpected victory for the country's reformist camp amid deep social discontent, economic hardship, and regional war. Pezeshkian won 16.3 million votes, according to reports which cited the local authorities, with the election seeing a 49.8% turnout. His rival Saeed Jalili, a hard-line right-wing former nuclear negotiator, finished the race with 13.5 million votes. The 69-year-old Pezeshkian managed to defeat several other candidates, all of whom were stanchly conservative, even as many analysts described him as the \"token reformist\" and a \"second-tier candidate\" in the contender pool with little name recognition. The most moderate of the candidates, he formerly served as minister of health under Iran's last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, from 1997 to 2005, and Khatami among other reformist politicians endorsed him. Pezeshkian has also been a member of parliament since 2008, and is a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the vice speaker of parliament. He wants to loosen social restrictions like Iran's strict hijab law and improve relations with the West, including potentially restarting nuclear talks with world powers.\n\nVehicles move past a billboard displaying the faces of the six presidential candidates (L-R) Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Amirhossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi Alireza Zakani, Saeed Jalili, Mostafa Pourmohammadi and Masoud Pezeshkianin in the Iranian capital Tehran on June 29, 2024. Iran's sole reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili are set to go to runoffs after securing the highest number of votes in Iran's presidential election, the interior ministry said. Atta Kenare | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFundamental changes unlikely?\n\nThe new Iranian president will have to contend with whoever takes the White House in November. This raises the stakes for both Tehran and Washington, as well as the Middle East writ large, as Iran comes closer than ever to nuclear bomb-production capability and continues to back proxy groups fighting Israel. On issues of foreign policy and war, the Iranian president wields some influence and is the country's public-facing messenger. But power and critical decision-making in Iran ultimately lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and unelected institutions like the Revolutionary Guards. \"While the election could lead to shifts in the priorities, tone and tactics of Iran's domestic and foreign policies, a fundamental change in the status quo is unlikely,\" Sina Toossi, a senior non-resident fellow at the Center for International Policy, told CNBC. \"The core principles guiding Iran's strategic decisions, particularly concerning the U.S. and Israel, are firmly rooted in the broader framework set by the Supreme Leader and influential bodies like the Revolutionary Guard,\" he said.\n\nwatch now",

    "body": "Vanessa Acosta marries Sam Roberts in their backyard in Pasadena, California, on May 25, 2024. Courtesy: Vanessa Acosta\n\nLast year, Vanessa Acosta and Sam Roberts found their dream venue for a black-tie wedding. But a series of family events made the couple reconsider their plans: \"We don't need to do this big thing where we're going to put ourselves out financially,\" said Acosta, 35, of Pasadena, California. Instead of hosting around 150 guests and spending about $75,000, the couple decided to get married in their backyard with just 54 of their closest family and friends. More from Personal Finance:\n\nCouples leverage \u2018something borrowed\u2019 to cut wedding costs\n\nNearly 1 in 5 student loan borrowers keep their balance a secret from partner\n\nWhy couples avoid talking about financial issues Such events with roughly 50 guests, max, are called \"micro weddings.\" A so-called minimony is even smaller, usually attended by no more than 10 people, according to The Knot, an online wedding marketplace. Acosta and Roberts had a new budget of $3,000, and they knew they needed to get creative. \"We DIY'ed and thrifted everything,\" Acosta said. \"We thrifted my husband's shirt, he used his really nice dress shoes he already owned. I made my dress and I thrifted the fabrics; I made my veil.\" Cutting the guest list made the wedding \"much more manageable,\" she said. The couple tied the knot on May 25.\n\nWhy micro weddings are becoming appealing\n\nVanessa Acosta and Sam Roberts pose together on a street in California. Courtesy: Vanessa Acosta\n\nThe average cost of a wedding ceremony and reception in 2023 was $35,000, according to The Knot 2023 Real Weddings Study. The total cost is a $5,000 increase from 2022. Inflation over the past few years was a key driver to higher costs, according to the Knot. The report polled 9,318 US married couples between January 1 and December 2023. \"Put simply, weddings are expensive,\" said Allison Cullman, wedding expert and the vice president of brand marketing and strategy at Zola, another online wedding marketplace.\n\n'The number one way' to save on wedding costs\n\nAs the cost of typical weddings in the U.S. has swelled in the past few years, experts say cutting down the guest list is the best way to save on costs, even if you don't trim it to micro-wedding levels. In 2023, weddings with 25 to 50 guests took up about 15% of the market; weddings with less than 25 guests made up roughly 2% of the market, according to data from The Wedding Report, a wedding research company, provided to CNBC. The average guest count at weddings has been declining since 2006, when the average was about 184 people, according to data from The Wedding Report.\n\nWe don't need to do this big thing where we're going to put ourselves out financially. Vanessa Acosta\n\nThe lowest count was in 2020, when the average headcount declined to 107, primarily due to restrictions from the Covid-19 pandemic, said Shane McMurray, CEO and co-founder of The Wedding Report. The size of weddings rebounded in 2021 to 124 because people wanted to socialize after the lockdowns, he said. \"But because of how expensive it is to get married now,\" he said, the size of weddings is \"probably going to start to come back down.\" \"The number one way to save money on your wedding is to cut the guest count,\" said McMurray, as many wedding costs, like meals, invitations and favors, are based on your headcount. Indeed, \"having a minimony or a micro wedding allows you to still have an incredibly special celebration without having to pay for 150 meals,\" said Cullman.\n\nA sign that reads, \"Welcome to the wedding of Vanessa and Sam.\" Courtesy: Vanessa acosta\n\n\"It literally was not stressful to deal with the food situation for like a 50-ish person wedding,\" said Acosta, who booked a taco stand for $640 instead of roughly paying $90 per plate for about 150 guests. \"Ninety times 150 people. It was a drastic change to go from that to a taco stand that was able to feed every single one and there was still food left over,\" said Acosta.\n\nSet a 'clear and realistic' budget\n\nEngaged couples should come up with a \"clear and realistic\" budget from the beginning, as well as make a list of what their priorities are, said Cullman. Doing so will help you when you have to make \"difficult decisions to stay within your budget,\" she said. \"Couples should discuss what is the most important to them, and what they want to allocate towards items that will make their wedding feel unique, authentic, and most of all, fun,\" said Cullman.

    "body": "In April 2021, Paul Lee took a vacation to Thailand. Five months later, he decided to leave the United States behind and make a permanent move to the Asian country. Lee, originally from Georgia, had been living in New York City and grossing around $1 million a year thanks to his e-commerce business. Despite doing well enough to pay for his parent's retirement, the 28-year-old tells CNBC Make It he found himself without purpose, feeling depressed, and needing to make a change. \"When I first arrived to Thailand, I just felt rejuvenated. Everything was completely new to me, and I felt like it was a fresh new start,\" Lee says. \"The more and more I live here, the more and more I fall in love with the city.\"\n\nLee moved to Bangkok, Thailand in 2021. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make It\n\nSince moving to Bangkok, Lee has been making around US $150,000 a year as a content creator and real estate agent, according to documents reviewed. Working in real estate helped Lee find several living arrangements in Bangkok, including luxury condos. The apartment he's in now is a one-bedroom in the Thonglor neighborhood which Lee says is \"the Soho of Bangkok.\" It's a 650-square-feet unit that costs 20,000 baht \u2014 around USD $544 \u2014 in monthly rent. Lee also pays $20 for Wi-Fi, $80 for electricity, and $3 for water each month. The apartment came furnished, and Lee has access to amenities, including a pool and a gym.\n\nLee pays around $544 a month for his 1-bedroom apartment in Bangkok. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make It\n\nTo move in, Lee had to pay a security deposit of two months' rent or about $1,088. Despite lower grocery costs in Bangkok, Lee eats out for every meal and spends $500 a month on food. \"I'm not gonna lie, the food in New York City was very good as well, but I think in Thailand, it's just a lot more homey, a lot more local, and a lot spicier,\" Lee says. His other expenses include a $93 monthly gym membership which is a bit of a splurge considering Lee has free access to a gym in his building. But the cost is worth it for Lee, because he can take advantage of the co-working space, coffee, and numerous networking opportunities in the space. Also his current gym's price is nothing compared to luxury gyms in New York, like Equinox, where memberships can start at $240 a month.\n\nLee tells CNBC Make It he chose to leave America because he found himself materialistic and living in an \"environment that was just very individualistic, very doggish, and very hyper-aggressive.\" Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make It\n\nLee has only returned to the U.S. one time since his big move to Thailand \u2014 for his sister's wedding. He tells CNBC Make It he chose to leave New York City because he found himself being too materialistic and living in an \"environment that was just very individualistic, very doggish, and very hyper-aggressive.\" \"Bangkok stood out to me because it seemed very metropolis. It seemed very fun. It seemed very affordable and it just had a very good culture and didn't really have any major compromises to me,\" Lee says. Lee has made a new life for himself in Thailand, he says, and returning to the U.S. doesn't feel likely. \"I had to go through this journey of being poor and becoming quite wealthy to realize all this wealth that I had accumulated didn't really give me what I wanted and didn't give me the satisfaction I was looking for,\" Lee says.\n\nSince relocating to Thailand, Lee's parents have moved to South Korea and visit him several times throughout the year.

    "body": "Gomez, who was a computer science student at the University of Toronto at the time of his internship, left Google in 2021 to co-found Cohere, an AI startup that's backed by Nvidia and has reportedly raised money at a $5 billion valuation. Cohere makes generative AI models that can be used by companies, in contrast to consumer-facing products like OpenAI 's ChatGPT.\n\n\"There's no one in the field who was around back then working who could have foreseen where we are in terms of technological capability,\" Gomez told CNBC in a recent interview. \"The models are doing stuff that I personally thought maybe I'd see at the end of my career, maybe in like 40 years.\"\n\nAidan Gomez was an intern at Google Brain in 2017, when he helped co-author the \" Attention Is All You Need \" paper that conceptualized the transformer and eventually kicked off the generative artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\"We're having research come out of MIT and Harvard showing the productivity gains,\" Gomez said. \"You can just quantitatively measure it. You sit a knowledge worker down next to one of these models. You train them on how to use it, how to make it useful for them. They have to learn how to use the technology, but once they do, you see productivity lifts that are like 40%.\"\n\nIn June 2023, Cohere raised $270 million at a $2.2 billion valuation, from investors including Salesforce and Oracle. Cohere executives have even attended AI forums at the White House.\n\nGomez said that until recently, \"Everything to date has been done with like five people.\" Cohere now has about 400 people and is rapidly growing its sales team.\n\nWhen asked about specific use cases where generative AI can benefit a company's bottom line, Gomez cited a model Cohere built to help an insurer. The technology allows the company to submit faster quotes to beat out the competition when there's a request for proposal from a mining or pipeline firm.\n\nGomez called it a race.\n\n\"The first insurance provider that puts a reasonable bid in front of them wins that contract,\" he said. \"We augmented their actuaries, the folks who are doing the research on the project, assessing the risk, coming up with a quote.\"\n\nBy speeding up the actuaries, Gomez said the business was able to win more contracts.\n\n\"I never thought that an insurance company for natural resource projects would be adopting large language models,\" he said. \"But they are.\"\n\nWatch the video to hear the full conversation between CNBC's Steve Kovach and Aidan Gomez.",

    "title": "Here are 3 major reports that could drive the stock market in the week ahead",
    "body": "Wall Street finished higher for the holiday-shortened trading week, with tech stocks leading the way. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained under 1% for the week. The S & P 500 and Nasdaq , which both closed at record highs Friday \u2014 rising nearly 2% and 3.5%, respectively, for the week. The first week of July continued the strength seen in June, the second quarter, and the first half of 2024. The S & P 500 technology sector was the big winner this past week, with Apple and Broadcom as our top Club stocks. Consumer discretionary and communication services, featuring Club name Meta Platforms and Alphabet , were also strong. Energy led to the downside this week, followed by health care and industrials. Looking back on the week, short as it was given the early close on Wednesday and Thursday off, we got some notable updates on the economy and heard from Club holding Constellation Brands . The Corona and Modelo brewer's quarterly results Wednesday were decent , and the stock initially popped on the news. We told members that we were taking some profits in Constellation shortly before the open . However, the troubled wine and spirits business remained a problem that management must address in the coming quarters. Shares finished Wednesday down more than 3%, though they recovered much of that on Friday for a relatively flat week. Helping Friday's largely higher session was drop in bond yields \u2013 precipitated by an uptick in June's unemployment rate to 4.1% and only modestly higher than expected nonfarm payrolls additions of 206,000. Wage inflation was right in line with expectations. Taken as a whole, the government's monthly jobs report card supported the case of the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its September meeting. While market odds favor a second cut in December, the Fed projected after its June meeting just one rate cut this year. This past week also brought updates on the manufacturing sector. On Monday, June's ISM Manufacturing purchasing managers index came in weaker than expected and pointed to a faster-than-expected contraction, and on Wednesday, May's factory order numbers showed a monthly decline versus expectations for a small increase. The ISM's services PMI for June, out Wednesday, also disappointed, as it showed a contraction in the services sectors. Economists had been expecting to see an expansion. These readings were also green lights for the Fed to start cutting rates. We hope everyone had a good July 4 th and has a restful weekend. You'll want to take advantage of the lull because believe it or not, earnings season is back. Three of the four big money center banks report this coming Friday, including Club name Wells Fargo . The government also delivers key data on consumer and wholesale inflation. Economic data : The June consumer price index (CPI) is out on Thursday morning, and the June producer price index (PPI) is out on Friday morning. Of the two, CPI carries more weight given that it more closely represents what consumers are paying for a basket of goods from one year, or month, to the next, which is the Fed's main concern. However, PPI is important to track because it tells us what is happening at the cost input level for corporations. That speaks to margin dynamics \u2013 and therefore, it can inform us on both profitability and potential price actions companies may need to take in the future to protect profitability. Within the CPI data, be sure to watch the shelter component, which has been a huge thorn in the Fed's side. Shelter, a barometer of what people pay for housing, has proven a very sticky source of inflation \u2013 a problem because, for most Americans, it represents a large and unavoidable cost. For headline CPI, economists are looking for a 3.1% annual increase, according to FactSet as of Friday. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is expected to increase 3.5% year over year. If realized, that would represent a slight deceleration at the headline level but a slight acceleration at the core level. As for PPI, economists are looking for a 2.3% annual increase at the headline level and a 2.5% year-over-year rise at the core level. Those numbers would be slightly higher than what we saw in May. Earnings season : Within the portfolio, net interest income (NII) guidance is going to be a key watch item when Wells Fargo reports its quarter this coming Friday. At an industry conference Tuesday, CFO Michael Santomassimo reiterated guidance for NII to be down 7% to 9% year over year. We still think this outlook could be conservative since the Fed's higher-for-longer policy is generally a tailwind to net interest income. However, other factors like muted loan demand have prevented Wells Fargo from raising its outlook this year. Recognizing strong recent runs in shares of Wells Fargo and our other Club bank Morgan Stanley , we took some profits this past Friday. Morgan Stanley is set to deliver its earnings on Tuesday, July 16. We're also interested to hear management's thoughts on the intended pace of share repurchases in the second half of the year, now that the results of the stress test are in. Wells Fargo \u2013 and our other bank name Morgan Stanely \u2013 both passed, indicating they have strong capital positions with excess money to return to shareholders. Other higher-level watch items in the Wells Fargo report include commentary on the state of consumer savings, an indication of further buying power, and the real estate market, which has been something we've been monitoring as the world finds a new normal post-Covid.

    "title": "The unique exercise this neuroscientist does for optimal brain health: 'Physical activity is so powerful for our brain'",
    "body": "To keep your brain health in good shape, you should engage in physical activity as often as you can.\n\n\"Physical activity is so powerful for our brain,\" Dr. Wendy Suzuki, neuroscientist and dean of NYU College of Arts and Science, said in an episode of a recent MasterClass series that features neuroscientists and psychiatrists sharing advice for optimal brain health.\n\nSuzuki mentioned how walking 10 minutes a day can do wonders for your mood and that strategic sports like soccer and basketball engage your prefrontal cortex more than other exercises. But the workout in Suzuki's weekly routine is much different than most others.\n\n\"I got pulled back into exercise from couch potato land with this amazing form of workout,\" Suzuki said. \"It's called intenSati.\"\n\nThe front half of the name \"inten\" stems from the word \"intention,\" Suzuki said. \"Sati is a Pali word that means mindfulness or awareness.\"\n\nCardio plus mantras is this neuroscientist's preferred exercise for brain health\n\nIntenSati involves moving your body while speaking affirmations out loud, Suzuki said. It was created by Patricia Moreno in 2002.\n\n\"This workout pairs high-energy cardio moves with high-emotion mantras that will leave you uplifted, connected, and strong,\" according to the official website for intenSati.\n\nSpeaking positive affirmations out loud can strongly impact your outlook on life and your overall mood, Suzuki said.\n\n\"If you shout out that you believe you will succeed, you are inspired, you are strong, for a whole hour with a whole bunch of other sweaty, affirmations-shouting people, you come out of that class feeling amazing.\"\n\nA recent study done at the University of California Berkeley encouraged 135 undergraduate students to say compassionate things to themselves for 20 seconds a day, coupled with compassionate touch like placing a hand on their heart. After one month of consistently doing this practice, students reported feeling less stress and seeing improvements in their mental health.\n\n\"But whatever the form of workout that you do, any time of day you can work out is the best time of day to workout because our lives are so busy,\" Suzuki said.\n\nA 2022 study that examined the health information of more than 500,000 people found that those who regularly engaged in vigorous physical activity like exercise and sports decreased their risk of developing dementia by 35%.\n\nBut even doing household chores regularly lowered an individual's risk by 21%.\n\n\"Every single drop of sweat counts for your brain,\" she said, \"And that's good news.\"\n\nWant to be a successful, confident communicator?

    "body": "Amy Dickinson, 64, has shared life advice in her widely syndicated news column, \"Ask Amy,\" for two decades. Over the years, she wrote many times about emotional intelligence \u2014 how to be more self-aware, manage your own feelings, and better show up for other people. In her final column, she concentrates her best advice into a few key phrases. \"I sometimes supply 'scripts' for people who have asked me for the right words to say,\" she wrote, \"and so I thought I would boil these down to some of the most important statements I believe anyone can make.\" Those seven phrases, according to Dickinson, are: I need help I'm sorry I forgive you I love you, just as you are I'm on your side You're safe You are not alone\n\nWhy it's so hard to say 'I need help'\n\nDickinson's first statement is arguably the most difficult for people to incorporate into their lives, experts say, because having to ask for help can make you feel vulnerable, unintelligent or like you're not in control. \"Many of us overestimate the likelihood that the people we're asking for help will say 'no.' For those who associate rejection with an attack on their self-worth, that's a big obstacle,\" Dutch psychoanalyst Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries wrote for the Harvard Business Review. \"Consequently, they would rather carry the burden of their problems alone.\" Asking for assistance actually shows self-awareness and can make the person you're approaching feel good, according to de Vries. \"When you place trust in others, you show that you value them, which deepens the relationship,\" he wrote. \"In turn, they'll trust you enough to ask for help when they're in need themselves.\"\n\n'Emotionally intelligent people understand' the power of empathy and gratitude\n\nShowing empathy, patience and gratitude for others by using phrases that build connection, like \"I'm on your side\" and \"you are not alone,\" is a surefire sign of emotional intelligence, says Juliette Han, a Harvard-trained neuroscientist and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. These characteristics can take you far both in the workplace and beyond it. \"Gratitude shouldn't be conditional, and emotionally intelligent people understand this well,\" Han recently told CNBC Make It. Telling colleagues you appreciate their efforts is a sign of high EQ, he adds. Emotionally intelligent people \"recognize and congratulate someone on a job well done, even if the work was behind the scenes, or they didn't personally gain from it, because they are compassionate and empathetic.\"\n\nA more fulfilled life with fewer regrets",

    "title": "Biden defends mental health, vows to stay in race as House Democrats set weekend meeting",
    "body": "US President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign event in Madison, Wisconsin, on July 5, 2024. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden insisted Friday that his damaging debate performance against former President Donald Trump was just a \"bad night,\" and not an indication of a more serious health condition. \"I was exhausted,\" Biden told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, in his first face-to-face TV interview since his raspy and disconnected debate last week. \"I didn't listen to my instincts, in terms of preparing, and [had] a bad night,\" said Biden, who also referred to his performance as a \"bad episode.\" When Stephanopoulos noted that Biden had returned from an overseas foreign policy trip in Europe about 11 days before the debate and spent six days at Camp David beforehand, Biden replied, \"I was sick, I was feeling terrible.\" Asked if he watched the debate later, Biden briefly paused and then said, \"I don't think I did, no.\" He said repeatedly that his performance was \"nobody's fault [but] mine.\" Biden also refused to entertain the idea of taking a cognitive or neurological test. \"I get a full neurological test every day,\" Biden said, referring to the rigors of the presidency. When Stephanopoulos pressed him on why he hadn't taken had any cognitive assessments, the president replied, \"No, no one said I had to.\"\n\nThe interview came on the same day that Biden defiantly rejected a growing chorus of Democrats, including top donors and allies, who are urging the 81-year-old incumbent to withdraw from the race. Biden, under aggressive questioning from Stephanopoulos about whether he is capable of either beating Trump in November or serving another four years in the White House, maintained that he believes he is up to both tasks. \"I'm running again because I think I understand best what has to be done,\" Biden said in the 23-minute interview. He appeared to foreclose any possibility of changing his mind, even in a scenario where party leaders and his close allies ask him to step aside. \"I mean, if the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race,\" he said. \"The Lord Almighty's not coming down.\" Biden said he has spoken since the debate with Democratic leaders who did not tell him to withdraw. But many Democratic lawmakers are still considering their next steps. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is holding a virtual meeting Sunday with the top Democrats on House committees, three sources told NBC News. The group is expected to focus on Biden, one of those sources told NBC. Less than a half-dozen House Democrats so far have called on Biden to drop out of the race so far, but that number could grow over the weekend. The president's remarks to Stephanopoulos echoed his earlier comments on the campaign trail that day. \"I am running and going to win again,\" Biden told a crowd of supporters during a speech in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n\"They're trying to push me out of the race,\" Biden told the crowd. \"Well let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm staying in the race.\" Biden told reporters on an airport tarmac after the campaign event that he had spoken to \"at least 20\" members of Congress who are \"telling me to stay in the race.\" Biden's decision could set the campaign on a path of increasing tension with some of its top allies and donors who, spurred by concerns about Biden's health and abilities, have called for a new nominee to lead the Democratic Party into the November elections. While Biden sounded consistently louder and clearer in Friday's remarks and interview than he did in last week's debate, he still occasionally slurred or fumbled over certain words and phrases.\n\nFrustration mounts among Dems\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, a longtime Biden ally, has launched a new effort to convene Democratic senators next week to discuss what Biden's path forward might be, NBC News reported. Asked on the tarmac about Warner's effort, the president dismissed it. Warner, he said, \"is the only one considering that. No one else has called me to do that.\" On Thursday, Disney heiress and longtime Democratic donor Abigail Disney told CNBC that she will withhold donations until Biden withdraws. On Wednesday, a group of business leaders corralled by the pro-Democracy Leadership Now Project urged Biden to step aside. Editorial boards of multiple newspapers, including The New York Times, have issued the same call. Questions are now swirling about how an alternative candidate, such as Vice President Kamala Harris, might take Biden's place as the new nominee. The Trump campaign and Republican Party, in turn, have started ramping up attacks on Harris. Harris told CBS News on Tuesday, \"Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once, and we're going to beat him again. Period.\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre held the line in a gaggle with reporters who peppered her with questions about Biden's capabilities during the flight to Madison. \"He said he had a bad debate,\" Jean-Pierre conceded. But \"90 minutes should not overshadow his career, his three-and-a-half [year] tenure as president.\" Biden, she added, \"is resolute, strong [and] thinking as clearly as he used to.\" But that solid front \u2014 buttressed by subsequent statements of support from Democratic governors and other allies \u2014 has done little to tamp down the anxieties of Trump's opponents.\n\nPolls are shifting",

The movie is directed by Jenkins and the screenplay is a collaboration between \u201cThe Chosen\u201d showrunner, Platte F. Clark, Darin McDaniel, and Ryan Swanson.\n\nIn an interview with Deseret News, Jenkins described the creation of the holiday movie as \u201ca dream come true,\u201d calling the project \u201cthe movie I\u2019ve most wanted to make my whole career.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t want to do it with anyone other than Lionsgate and Kingdom, who make great movies while supporting filmmakers,\u201d he said.\n\nJenkins once described \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever\u201d as \u201cthe movie that I was born to make,\u201d adding, \u201cIf I could only make one more movie for the rest of my life, this is it.\u201d\n\nThe book \u2014 and the upcoming movie \u2014 chronicles the lives of the Herdman children. The six kids are known for being troublemakers and one day show up at a church, where Judy Greer, the director of the annual Christmas program, is in over her head.\n\nAt that point, the Herdmans take over the pageant, leaving the townspeople worried they will ruin everything. Ultimately, though, the misfit kids make the program better than anything they\u2019d seen before.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nThe story, Jenkins explained in an Instagram post, is \u2014 at its core \u2014 a story about \u201cthe least of these.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to what \u2018The Chosen\u2019 is trying to do, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to take the story of Christmas and story of Jesus and taking down from stained glass windows and pretty paintings \u2026 and revealing what it actually is.

    "body": "It\u2019s tempting to look at the so-called \u201cGreat Abstaining,\u201d as The Cut put it, and think it\u2019s a notch on the belt of those preaching biblical morality in a culture run amok.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, unfortunately.\n\nI think what we\u2019re seeing now \u2014 this growing (and, on its face, encouraging) trend toward sexual abstinence \u2014 is just the flip side of the same counterfeit coin: the siren sound of the world, of our own fractured morality. It\u2019s the same voice that has told us: \u201cSex is just sex.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in casual hookups.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem if it\u2019s consensual, with or without marriage?\u201d\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d\n\nNow, apparently, many are choosing to abstain from sex (ironically) for what I believe to be the very same reasons they opted to have sex indiscriminately.\n\nScripture urges abstinence outside of marriage because God calls us to keep the marriage bed \u201cundefiled\u201d (Hebrews 13:4-6). In the beginning, God made clear His design is for man and woman to join together in marriage and become \u201cone flesh\u201d (Genesis 2:24). Those principles \u2014 the spiritual bond solidified by the act of sex \u2014 reverberate throughout the biblical narrative. The Apostle Paul urged believers to practice lordship over their bodies and fleshly desires, even going so far as to write that, to the man who has sex with a prostitute, with her he has become \u201cone body\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:12-20).\n\nSex is a gift from God intended to bring about a beautiful spiritual oneness expressed in the physical world.\n\nSo what\u2019s the issue, then, with this burgeoning \u201cGreat Abstaining?\u201d Well, it\u2019s rooted not in recognition of just how important and sacred sex is. Rather, it\u2019s just the opposite; it seems tethered to the errant belief that there is no real value in sex and its ultimate, tangible purpose \u2014 procreation.\n\nPeople are choosing to opt out of sex because they are rejecting the value of relationship, of romance, and, finally, of marriage.\n\nRather than finding satisfaction in husband-and-wife relationships, younger Americans are choosing themselves over sacrificial love. The Cut\u2019s Kelsey Osgood wrote the next generation is \u201cdeemphasizing traditional romance.\u201d They aren\u2019t just choosing to shun marriage; many are actively arguing it\u2019s no longer valuable.\n\nAs for sexuality, they are opting to gratify their own urges in the same hedonistic way our broken world has always encouraged, just with a new spin. This is entirely unsurprising, given our culture\u2019s years-long celebration of so-called \u201cself-love.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe benefits from a period of celibacy are endless because, ultimately, it\u2019s about self-development,\u201d The Independent reported last year.\n\nThe societal shift toward abstinence isn\u2019t moral; it\u2019s egotistical.\n\nPorn use, for example, is soaring. For context, see this from Psychology Today:\n\nXvideos, the top-ranked pornography site, had 700,000,000 more total visits than Amazon and 900,000,000, 1,100,000,000, 1,300,000,000, 1,500,000,000, and 1,800,000,000 more total visits than TikTok, OpenAI, LinkedIn, Netflix, and The Weather Channel, respectively.\n\nThen there are those who see abstinence as just the next wave of \u201csexual liberation,\u201d another irony.\n\nModels like Julia Fox are choosing to forgo sex as a way of \u201cprotesting\u201d the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court, she seemed to argue recently, has \u2014 in her view \u2014 taken away her rights to abortion as birth control, so now she\u2019s going to abstain from sex altogether because it could lead to pregnancy. (Shouldn\u2019t that have been a consideration all along? But I digress.)\n\n\u201cI felt like, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, if they were gonna take away our rights to our body and our reproductive rights, well, then, this is my way of taking them back,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I feel like more women should really get on that, because we hold the power.\u201d\n\nAll of this to say: this is so often how Satan and our own deceitful hearts work. They take a modicum of truth \u2014 that abstinence is a good thing \u2014 and twist the motives in a sinful direction.\n\nIf there is a silver lining here \u2014 and I believe there\u2019s always a Gospel opportunity in every cultural conversation \u2014 it\u2019s that such a trend could pave the way for fruitful conversations about why, in actuality, abstinence is good, why God designed sexual expression to be enjoyed within certain parameters, and how sex is a gift that should be celebrated and is profoundly redemptive when enjoyed within God\u2019s boundaries, rather than destructive.",
    "summary": "But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, unfortunately.\nI think what we\u2019re seeing now \u2014 this growing (and, on its face, encouraging) trend toward sexual abstinence \u2014 is just the flip side of the same counterfeit coin: the siren sound of the world, of our own fractured morality.\nScripture urges abstinence outside of marriage because God calls us to keep the marriage bed \u201cundefiled\u201d (Hebrews 13:4-6).\nModels like Julia Fox are choosing to forgo sex as a way of \u201cprotesting\u201d the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\nThey take a modicum of truth \u2014 that abstinence is a good thing \u2014 and twist the motives in a sinful direction.",

    "body": "An ancient tree from India is now thriving in groves where citrus trees once flourished in Florida, and could help provide the nation with renewable energy.\n\nAs large parts of the Sunshine State\u2019s once-famous citrus industry have all but dried up over the past two decades because of two fatal diseases, greening and citrus canker, some farmers are turning to the pongamia tree, a climate-resilient tree with the potential to produce plant-based proteins and a sustainable biofuel.\n\nFor years, pongamia has been used for shade trees, producing legumes \u2014 little brown beans \u2014 that are so bitter wild hogs won\u2019t even eat them.\n\nBut unlike the orange and grapefruit trees that long occupied these rural Florida groves northwest of West Palm Beach, pongamia trees don\u2019t need much attention.\n\nPongamia trees also don\u2019t need fertilizer or pesticides. They flourish in drought or rainy conditions. And they don\u2019t require teams of workers to pick the beans. A machine simply shakes the tiny beans from the branches when they are ready to harvest.\n\nTerviva, a San Francisco-based company founded in 2010 by Naveen Sikka, then uses its patented process to remove the biopesticides that cause the bitter taste, making the beans suitable for food production.\n\n\u201cFlorida offers a rare opportunity for both Terviva and former citrus farmers. The historical decline of the citrus industry has left farmers without a crop that can grow profitably on hundreds of thousands of acres, and there needs to be a very scalable replacement, very soon,\u201d Sikka told The Associated Press. \u201cPongamia is the perfect fit.\u201d\n\nWhat is the pongamia tree?\n\nThe pongamia is a wild tree native to India, Southeast Asia and Australia.\n\nThe legume is now being used to produce several products, including Panova culinary oil and protein, which are featured ingredient in Aloha\u2019s Kona protein bars. The company also makes protein flour.\n\nThe legumes also produce oil that can be used as a biofuel, largely for aviation, which leaves a very low carbon footprint, said Ron Edwards, chairman of Terviva\u2019s board of directors and a long-time Florida citrus grower.\n\nTurning a wild tree into a domestic one hasn\u2019t been easy, Edwards said.\n\n\u201cThere are no books to read on it, either, because no one else has ever done it,\u201d he said.\n\nBees and other pollinators feast on the pongamia\u2019s flowers, supporting local biodiversity, Edwards said. An acre of the trees can potentially provide the same amount of oil as four acres of soy beans, he added.\n\nWhat\u2019s left after the oil is removed from the pongamia bean is \u201ca very high-grade protein that can be used as a substitute in baking and smoothies and all kinds of other plant-based protein products,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for the food industry and the oil and petroleum industry.\u201d\n\nWhy Florida?\n\n\u201cWe know pongamia grows well in Florida, and the end markets for the oil and protein that come from the pongamia beans \u2014 biofuel, feed, and food ingredients \u2014 are enormous,\u201d Sikka said. \u201cSo farmers can now reduce their costs and more closely align to the leading edge of sustainable farming practices.\u201d\n\nAt a nursery near Fort Pierce, workers skilled in pongamia grafting techniques affix a portion of the mother tree to a pongamia rootstock, which ensures the genetics and desired characteristics of the mother tree are perpetuated in all of Terviva\u2019s trees.\n\nPongamia vs. citrus\n\nCitrus had been Florida\u2019s premier crop for years until disease caught up with it starting in the 1990s with citrus canker and later greening.\n\nCitrus canker, a bacterial disease, is not harmful to humans, but it causes lesions on the fruit, stems and leaves. Eventually, it makes the trees unproductive.\n\nCitrus greening, also known as Huanglongbing, slowly kills trees and degrades the fruit, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Greening has spread throughout Florida since 2005, devastating countless groves and reducing citrus production by 75%. The disease has spread to Louisiana, Texas and California.\n\nHurricane Ian caused about $1.8 billion in damages to Florida\u2019s agriculture in September 2023, hitting the citrus industry at the beginning of its growing season.\n\nDisease and climate issues have also affected most of the world\u2019s top citrus-producing countries. For example, this year\u2019s harvest in Brazil \u2014 the world\u2019s largest exporter of orange juice \u2014 is forecast to be the worst in 36 years because of flooding and drought, according to a forecast by Fundecitrus, a citrus growers\u2019 organization in Sao Paulo state.\n\nBut climate and disease have little effect on pongamia trees, the company\u2019s officials said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just tough, a jungle-tested tree\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIt stands up to a lot of abuse with very little caretaking.\u201d\n\nPongamia also grows well in Hawaii, where it now thrives on land previously used for sugarcane.\n\nWhat are citrus farmers saying?\n\nJohn Olson, who owns Circle O Ranch, west of Fort Pierce, has replaced his grapefruit groves with 215 acres (87.01 hectares) of pongamia trees.\n\n\u201cWe went through all the ups and downs of citrus and eventually because of greening, abandoned citrus production,\u201d Olson said. \u201cFor the most part, the citrus industry has died in Florida.\u201d\n\nWhile the grapefruit grove was modest, it was common for a grove that size to be profitable in the 1980s and 1990s, Olson said.\n\nEdwards said farmers used various sprays to kill the insect that was spreading the disease. Eventually, the cost of taking care of citrus trees became too risky.\n\nThat\u2019s when he decided to go a different route.\n\n\u201cWhat attracted me to pongamia was the fact that one it can repurpose fallow land that was citrus and is now lying dormant,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom an ecological point of view, it\u2019s very attractive because it can replace some of the oils and vegetable proteins that are now being generated by things like palm oil, which is environmentally a much more damaging crop.\u201d\n\nWhat about biofuel?\n\nIn December 2023, Terviva signed an agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation to provide biofuel feedstock that can be converted into biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Mitsubishi is off to a great start,\u201d Sikka said, noting that the company coordinates closely with Mitsubishi on tree plantings and product development and sales. \u201cTerviva\u2019s progress has accelerated thanks to Mitsubishi\u2019s expertise and leadership around the globe on all facets of Terviva\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nWhat food products does pongamia produce?\n\nThe research is ongoing, but Edwards said they have made really good graham crackers in addition to the table oil and other plant-based protein products, including flour and protein bars.\n\nPongamia offers an alternative to soybean and yellow pea protein \u201cif you don\u2019t want your protein to come from meat,\u201d he said.",

    "title": "Alec Baldwin is about to go on trial in the death of \u2018Rust\u2019 cinematographer. Here are key things to know",
    "body": "Nearly three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was shot and killed on the New Mexico set of the film \u201cRust,\u201d Alec Baldwin is going on trial over her death. Here are the essential things to know.\n\nWhat charge does Alec Baldwin face?\n\nThe actor is about to enter a New Mexico courtroom for the first time since the Oct. 21, 2021 shooting. He is charged with felony involuntary manslaughter. If a jury unanimously convicts him, he could get 18 months in prison.\n\nBaldwin, the star and co-producer of the Western, was pointing a revolver at Hutchins during a rehearsal in a small church on the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch when the gun went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the gun fired.\n\nTwo major themes will predominate, one large, one small: the chaotic atmosphere of the movie set, and the details of the Italian-made classic revolver that Baldwin pointed at Hutchins.\n\nIt has never been officially determined who brought the live rounds that killed Hutchins on to the set. Prosecutors at the previous trial of \u201cRust\u201d armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed alleged that she was responsible. She was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to the same 18 months in prison Baldwin faces.\n\nWhat jurors must decide\n\nProsecutors have two alternative standards for proving the charge. One is based on the negligent use of a firearm. The other is proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Baldwin acted with total disregard or indifference for the safety of others.\n\nDespite the legal and technical complexities of the case, the 12 citizens of Santa Fe County that will make up the jury will have to reach just one verdict \u2014 guilty or not guilty \u2014 on a single count.\n\nHow long is the Alec Baldwin trial expected to last?\n\nThe trial at the First Judicial District Court of New Mexico \u2014 about 20 miles northeast of the movie set and the shooting \u2014 is projected to last nine days, and Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer insists that she\u2019ll keep the lawyers in line and on schedule. Jury selection begins Tuesday, with opening statements expected Wednesday, and the projected end the following Friday. Once the jurors get the case, however, they can deliberate as long as needed.\n\nWhy is Alec Baldwin famous?\n\nBaldwin, 66, emerged as a major movie star in the late 1980s and early \u201890s through films like \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d and \u201cThe Hunt for Red October,\u201d and has remained a household name ever since. He would move on to memorable supporting roles in films including 2003\u2019s \u201cThe Cooler,\u201d which got him an Oscar nomination. Comedy dominated his later career as he won two Emmys for playing network executive Jack Donaghy on six seasons of \u201c30 Rock,\u201d and won a third for playing Donald Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nHe has also played the role of outsized public personality, as a cherished talk-show guest, a sought-after liberal, and at times as a man unable to control his outbursts of anger, which have brought public embarrassment and a previous run-in with the law much more minor than the current one.\n\nBaldwin is the eldest of six children \u2014 five of them actors \u2014 from Massapequa, New York, who has lived in New York City for most of his adult life. He has an adult daughter, Ireland Baldwin, with his first wife Kim Basinger, and seven small children with his second wife, Hilaria Baldwin.\n\nAlec Baldwin\u2019s defense\n\nBaldwin will bring with him an elite legal team of mostly New York-based attorneys, many of them Harvard Law graduates, from the firm of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. Alex Spiro, a 41-year-old defense attorney who has represented Elon Musk, Megan Thee Stallion and other prominent figures and has become among the most sought-after lawyers in the country, will give aggressive cross-examination to the state\u2019s witnesses.\n\nThe defense will try to show that it is not the job of an actor to make sure real rounds are not in his gun, a position strongly supported by Baldwin\u2019s union, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.\n\nBaldwin said in an interview with ABC News, and implied in interviews with authorities, that he never pulled the revolver\u2019s trigger.\n\nHis lawyers will also attack the gun evidence, and the serious damage done to the revolver during an FBI test they say amounted to the destruction of evidence and left the defense no chance to examine it.\n\nFirearms experts for the prosecution who testified at the Gutierrez-Reed trial are returning to the witness stand, over objections by Baldwin, to testify about his handling of the revolver and whether the gun was functioning properly.\n\nAnd they may press witnesses over whether Hutchins received proper medical treatment between the shooting and the declaration of her death at a hospital.\n\nThe prosecution team\n\nSanta Fe County District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies appointed Kari Morrissey as a special prosecutor in the Baldwin case in early 2023 after her predecessor stepped down because of conflicts of interest. Morrissey promptly had the indictment against Baldwin dismissed, but revived it in January of this year by grand jury. Both moves came from further examination of the evidence, she said.\n\nMorrissey graduated from the University of New Mexico and its law school, and practiced law in Albuquerque for more than 20 years. New Mexico criminal defense attorney Erlinda Johnson joined Morrissey\u2019s team in April.\n\nThe trial could bring a culture clash between the team of attorneys, as fiery hearings and filings have already shown.\n\nMorrissey and Spiro in particular have butted heads often \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and be called a liar!\u201d \u2014 she said during one such moment at a May hearing \u2014 and will likely do the same and provide some drama during the proceedings.\n\nThe prosecutors will try to convince jurors that as a producer and the most important person on the set, Baldwin brought a recklessness to the production, and that as an actor he was negligent in handling his gun.\n\nWho\u2019s expected to testify at the Alec Baldwin trial\n\nThe crew members inside the small church building who became eye-witnesses to Hutchins\u2019 killing will provide the trial\u2019s most essential testimony. They include director Joel Souza, who was himself shot and wounded by the bullet from Baldwin\u2019s gun, and assistant director David Halls, the film\u2019s assistant director, who some said was responsible for the shooting but pleaded no contest to negligent handling of a firearm.\n\nZac Sneesby, a crew member who was holding a boom microphone during the rehearsal, will testify that he saw Baldwin pull the trigger of the revolver, prosecutors said in court filings, making him potentially the most important witness of all.\n\nProsecutors also may call Gutierrez-Reed to the stand, but Marlowe Sommer rejected an immunity deal they wanted to give her.\n\nJurors will hear testimony from firearms experts who allege the revolver was working properly could not have fired without pulling the trigger.\n\nAnd Baldwin himself can take the stand in his defense, but he doesn\u2019t have to. His attorneys have not said which he will do.\n\nWhere the \u2018Rust\u2019 shooting happened\n\nSanta Fe, New Mexico\u2019s capital, an arts mecca of 89,000 people and a tourist destination for its historic Southwestern beauty, is no small town. And its downtown modern legal complex is hardly a country courthouse. But the location is still a far cry from the coastal urban courts where the celebrity trials of Bill Cosby, O.J. Simpson, Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump were held.\n\nThe proceedings could make for an unusual scene. Scores of members of the national media will compete for seats in the Santa Fe courtroom and an overflow room, and cameras will surround the courthouse for arrivals and departures.\n\nAnd the public can watch. The trial will be streamed and broadcast by several outlets including Court TV.\n\nWho is Halyna Hutchins?\n\nHutchins, who was 42 when she died, was a cinematographer on the rise and a mother of a young son when she was killed. She grew up on a remote Soviet military base and worked on documentary films in Eastern Europe before studying film in Los Angeles and embarking on a promising movie-making career.",

    "body": "In the running debate between actively managed funds versus simply investing in a fund that tracks the S&P 500, the scorecard continues to tilt toward the broad stock market index.\n\nAccording to data from Morningstar Direct, just 18.2% of actively managed funds whose primary prospectus benchmark is the S&P 500 managed to outperform the index in the first half of this year.\n\nThat\u2019s on track to be worse than last year, when only 19.8% of actively managed funds beat the S&P 500.\n\nOf course, some years are better for fund managers than others. In 2022, when the Federal Reserve launched its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in decades and sent the S&P 500 tumbling, 63.3% of active funds outperformed. In 2014, only 14.2% did.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the average share of active funds that beat the S&P 500 was 27%, setting up 2024 to be an especially weak year.\n\nData from Morningstar Direct also shows that 13.4% of passively managed funds are outperforming so far this year. And over the past decade, passive funds consistently trailed active funds in the share that beat the S&P 500.\n\nBut that\u2019s not surprising given that many passive funds are only looking to keep pace with the index and maintain lower expenses rather than charge higher fees and hope that they get bigger returns.\n\nTo be sure, the vast majority of the S&P 500\u2019s recent gains have come from just a handful of tech giants. That leaves index investors vulnerable to a selloff in one stock like Nvidia. Still, even as Nvidia has come well off its highs over the past few weeks, the index has continued to hit fresh records as other stocks climbed.\n\nMeanwhile, separate data showed that the S&P 500 beat three out of every four exchange-traded funds in the past year, the worst showing for ETFs since at least 2010.\n\nIn addition, funds that are diversified across asset classes and geographies also fared worse than the S&P 500. Such portfolios have lagged the index in 13 of the last 15 years, according to data from Cambria Funds cited by Bloomberg. Other data showed that out of 370 asset-allocation funds tracked by Morningstar, just one has beaten the index since 2009.\n\n\u201cIn a low-volatility, high-return environment like 2024, investors should stick to the basics \u2014 buying uncomplicated index funds, and active mutual funds with a proven track record of delivering alpha,\u201d Evercore strategist Julian Emanuel told Bloomberg last month. \u201cNo need to complicate strategy. In simplicity there is beauty.\u201d",

    "title": "One of the most accurate recession indicators is close to sounding the alarm as unemployment continues to rise",
    "body": "The U.S. unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1% in June from 4% in the prior month, nearly triggering a reliable recession indicator.\n\nWhile unemployment is still historically low, its rate of increase could be a sign of deteriorating economic conditions. That\u2019s where the so-called Sahm Rule comes in.\n\nIt says that when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate rises by at least a half-percentage point from its low during the previous 12 months, then a recession has started. This rule would have signaled every recession since 1970.\n\nBased on the latest unemployment figures from the Labor Department\u2019s monthly report on Friday, the gap between the two has expanded to 0.43 in June from 0.37 in May.\n\nIt\u2019s now at the highest level since March 2021, when the economy was still recovering from the pandemic-induced crash.\n\nThe creator of the rule, Claudia Sahm, was an economist at the Federal Reserve and is now chief economist at New Century Advisors. She has previously explained that even from low levels a rising unemployment rate can set off a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession.\n\n\u201cWhen workers lose paychecks, they cut back on spending, and as businesses lose customers, they need fewer workers, and so on,\u201d she wrote in a Bloomberg opinion column in November, adding that once this feedback loop starts, it is usually self-reinforcing and accelerates.\n\nBut she also said the pandemic may have caused so many disruptions in the economy and the labor market that indicators like the Sahm Rule that are based on unemployment may not be as accurate right now.\n\nA few weeks ago, however, Sahm told CNBC that the Federal Reserve risks sending the economy into a recession by continuing to hold off on rate cuts.\n\n\u201cMy baseline is not recession,\u201d she said on June 18. \u201cBut it\u2019s a real risk, and I do not understand why the Fed is pushing that risk. I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re waiting for.\u201d\n\nThat came days after the Fed\u2019s June policy meeting when central bankers kept rates steady after holding them at 5.25%-5.5%\u2014the highest since 2001\u2014since July 2023.\n\nThe Fed meets again at the end of this month and is expected to remain on hold, but odds are rising that a cut could happen in September.\n\nSahm also said last month that the Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s stated preference to wait for a deterioration in job gains is a mistake and that policymakers should instead focus on the rate of change in the labor market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone into recession with all different levels of unemployment,\u201d she explained. \u201cThese dynamics feed on themselves. If people lose their jobs, they stop spending, [and] more people lose jobs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street has had a more sanguine view of the economy, citing last year\u2019s widespread recession predictions that proved wrong as well as the AI boom that\u2019s helping to fuel a wave of investment and earnings growth.\n\nLast month, Neuberger Berman senior portfolio manager Steve Eisman also pointed to the boost in infrastructure spending.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just powering through, and I think the only conclusion you can reach is that the U.S. economy is more dynamic than it\u2019s ever been in its history,\u201d he told CNBC.",

    "body": "Americans on average say they need to earn more than $186,000 a year to live comfortably, according to a recent Bankrate survey, down 20% from a year ago.\n\nDifferent demographic groups had different income thresholds, but they all declined\u2014except for one. Gen Z respondents said they need to make $200,000 a year to feel comfortable or financially secure, up 3.6% from Bankrate\u2019s 2023 survey.\n\nMeanwhile, every other age group lowered their income thresholds. And when looking across different gender and racial/ethnic groups as well as Americans with kids or without, income thresholds also fell (with Gen Z and the other age cohorts included in those groups too).\n\nGen Z was also an outlier on what it would take to feel rich. On average, Americans said they need to earn $520,000 a year to reach that status, up 7.7% from a year earlier.\n\nIncome thresholds for most demographic groups saw comparable single-digit percentage increases, while Gen X\u2019s saw a slight dip. But Gen Z\u2019s was up a whopping 20.7% to $461,000.\n\nThe changes in what Americans think they need to earn to come as they also report feeling more financial insecurity. In fact, while the level of income for living comfortably dropped, it\u2019s still more than double the average full-time income of $79,000.\n\nThe latest Bankrate survey said 25% say they are completely financially secure, down from 28% in 2023, while 75% were not completely financially secure, up from 72% in 2023.\n\n\u201cMany Americans are stuck somewhere between continued sticker shock from elevated prices, a lack of income gains and a feeling that their hopes and dreams are out of touch with their financial capabilities,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, Bankrate\u2019s senior economic analyst, in the report.\n\nThe share of Gen Z respondents who felt financially secure saw a dip to 24% from 25%. But they were the most optimistic of the different age groups, with 64% saying they are not completely secure now but will be someday. That compares with 53% for millennials, 48% for Gen X, and 26% for baby boomers.\n\nThat\u2019s despite the rising cost of living, heavy debt burdens, and the historically unaffordable U.S. housing market that now requires a six-figure income to afford a median-priced home.\n\nMeanwhile, separate surveys have found that Gen Z and millennials are increasingly suffering from \u201cmoney dysmorphia\u201d that has skewed how they view themselves financially.\n\nAccording to an Intuit Credit Karma survey in January, 45% of Gen Zers and millennials are obsessed with the idea of being rich, with 48% of Gen Zers and 59% of millennials feeling behind financially.\n\n\u201cMoney dysmorphia is kind of like today\u2019s version of keeping up with the Joneses,\u201d Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, wrote in the report. \u201cA lot of people are examining their finances and comparing themselves to their peers, people on social media, and even celebrities, which is bringing up feelings of inadequacy.\u201d",

Since moving to Miami in 2022, he\u2019s vowed to become more involved in Florida politics and has donated to other local politicians including Governor Ron DeSantis and the city of Miami mayor, Francis Suarez.\n\nIn South Florida\u2019s tiered government structure, the county mayor has substantial more power than her city counterparts, including Suarez. Unlike Suarez, a one-time Republican presidential contender who\u2019s come under fire for conflicts of interest on his side jobs, Cava\u2019s position is full time.

    "body": "Turkey will soon unveil an agreement with BYD Co. to construct a $1 billion plant in the west of the country, Turkish officials said, boosting the Chinese carmaker\u2019s presence in Europe at a time of escalating trade tensions.\n\nTurkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to announce the accord on Monday during a ceremony in Manisa province, where the plant will be built, the officials said, asking not to be named because they aren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. BYD representatives and the president\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nThe new factory would improve BYD\u2019s access to the European Union, because Turkey has a customs-union agreement with the bloc. The EU moved ahead this week with plans to impose provisional tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, hitting BYD with an additional 17.4% charge on top of the existing 10% rate.\n\nThere\u2019s also a domestic market to serve, with EVs accounting for 7.5% of car sales last year in Turkey, a country with a population of almost 90 million.\n\nTurkey announced Friday that it was walking back plans announced almost a month ago to impose an additional 40% tariff on all vehicles from China, citing efforts to encourage investment. That decision followed talks between Erdogan and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping on Thursday during a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Astana, Kazakhstan.\n\nBYD has been on a tear the last several years in China, becoming the nation\u2019s best-selling car brand. The Shenzhen-based manufacturer has vowed to bring its lower-priced EVs to Europe in the coming years, including the Seagull hatchback that executives expect to sell for less than \u20ac20,000($21,700).\n\nThe automaker opened its first EV plant in Southeast Asia on Thursday, in Thailand. BYD has also taken over a former Ford Motor Co. factory in Brazil and been scoping out locations for a plant in Mexico. Its first car factory for Europe, in Hungary, is under construction.\n\nBYD\u2019s sales jumped to a record 982,747 vehicles in the second quarter, up more than 40% from a year ago. While the company\u2019s sales in Europe have been sluggish thus far, it\u2019s mounting a major marketing push in the region, taking Volkswagen AG\u2019s place as a main sponsor of the European Championship football tournament.",

    "title": "Asia\u2019s richest person, who is worth $116 billion, is about to throw an extravagant wedding for scions of Indian business empires",
    "body": "In March, Asia\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani threw a three-day prenuptial bash for his son that included a 1,200-person guest list, including former world leaders, tech tycoons and Bollywood\u2019s megastars, and a performance by renowned singer Rihanna.\n\nIt was only the start of their months-long lavish pre-wedding celebrations which have grabbed headlines and set off a social media frenzy.\n\nIn May, the family took guests on a 3-day pre-wedding cruise from Italy to France, which included a DJ set from David Guetta, Katy Perry belting out her hit song \u201cFirework\u201d and a performance by Pitbull to cap it off, according to media reports.\n\nFinally, the wedding is set for next week, with Anant Ambani, 29, marrying his longtime girlfriend, Radhika Merchant, in what many have dubbed the wedding of the year.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know:\n\nWho are the Ambanis?\n\nThe father of the groom is Mukesh Ambani, 66, currently the world\u2019s 9th richest man with a net worth of $116 billion, according to Forbes. He is also the richest person in Asia.\n\nHis Reliance Industries is a massive conglomerate, reporting over $100 billion in annual revenue, with interests ranging from petrochemicals, and oil and gas to telecoms and retail.\n\nThe Ambani family owns, among other assets, a 27-story private apartment building, named Antila, worth $1 billion in Mumbai. It has three helipads, a 160-car garage, a private movie theater, a swimming pool, and a fitness center.\n\nAmbani\u2019s critics say his company has flourished mainly because of political connections during the Congress governments in the 1970s and 80s and subsequently under Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s rule after 2014. They say \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d in India has helped certain corporations, such as Ambani\u2019s, thrive.\n\nThe family patriarch has started passing the torch to his two sons and daughter. The oldest son, Akash Ambani, is now chairperson of Reliance Jio, their telecoms business; his daughter, Isha, oversees retail, while the groom Anant, the youngest, has been inducted into the new energy business.\n\nWho are the bride and groom?\n\nAnant has a bachelor\u2019s degree from Brown University, according to Reliance Industries\u2019 website, and oversees the conglomerate\u2019s renewable and green energy expansion.\n\nHe also runs a 3,000-acre (nearly 1,200-hectare) animal rescue center called Vantara in Gujarat state\u2019s Jamnagar, the family\u2019s hometown where guests in March spent days celebrating in the extravagant pre-wedding party.\n\nThe bride, Radhika Merchant, 29, is the daughter of pharmaceutical tycoon Viren Merchant and is the marketing director for his company, Encore Healthcare, according to Vogue.\n\nShe told the magazine that the two were introduced through mutual friends in 2017. \u201cThat first meeting just sparked something special between us, and it wasn\u2019t long before we started dating,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen\u2019s the wedding and what\u2019s expected?\n\nThe main wedding ceremony is set for July 12, followed by a grand reception on July 14, according to local media. Celebrations are expected to be split between the Ambani\u2019s Jio World Convention Center in Mumbai city and their family home.\n\nThe dates were reportedly chosen based on the couple\u2019s birth charts, as is typical in Hindu custom, and deemed auspicious. Also keeping with tradition, the wedding will be preceded by days of traditional wedding events and rituals.\n\nOn Friday, Indian social media was abuzz with videos from the couple\u2019s sangeet, a ceremony where the bride and groom\u2019s families perform dances for the guests. It also included performances by Bollywood stars like Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh and Salman Khan as well as Justin Bieber, who flew to Mumbai for the event, according to local media.\n\nThe family also organized a mass wedding for more than 50 underprivileged couples last week, as part of the pre-wedding celebrations.\n\nExtravagant parties are the Ambanis\u2019 specialty and next week\u2019s events are expected to draw more celebrities, billionaires and world leaders.\n\nIn March for the pre-wedding bash, the guest list included Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, former leaders of Canada and Qatar as well as Bollywood\u2019s A-list stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone. In addition to Rihanna, Akon and Diljit Dosanjh, a Punjabi singer who shot to international fame when he performed at Coachella, also took the stage.\n\nIn 2018, when his daughter married, Ambani made the headlines because of the grand celebrations, with pop sensation Beyonc\u00e9 performing at the pre-wedding festivities. At the time, former U.S. Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among those who rubbed shoulders with Indian celebrities and Bollywood stars in the western Indian city of Udaipur.",

    "title": "Marius van der Ham: AirFrance-KLM Kenya boss privilege and small ego issue",
    "body": "The love affair between the dark suit and the crisp white shirt has been written ad nauseam but it hasn\u2019t been written by me. I\u2019m different. It\u2019s not news but because I said it, it\u2019s fresh.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I think when Marius van der Ham, the AirFrance-KLM General Manager for East and Southern Africa, Nigeria and Ghana walks in, six-feet-something, soft-spoken, in a PR move that shows why the suit took the place of the hat once occupied as the badge separating the ambitious executive from lower echelon workers. Sometimes the suit wears the man, sometimes the man wears the suit.\n\nHere's a quick cheat sheet to the man: a big table. Marius loves big tables. To laugh, bond, eat. I had been briefed that he is a man of few words, slicing the fat off his sentences for lean, quick, ripostes. He is Dutch after all, who are not known for beating around the bush.\n\nBut it\u2019s the bush that calls Marius. I can tell because he lights up when he talks about his runs, the animals he sees, and the terrain. Oh, the terrain. \u201cA hill after every other kilometre!\u201d he says, wiping the expression off his face, and I am not sure whether he is elated or dissatisfied. What\u2019s that the Dutch say? \u201cHet is zoals het is.\u201d It is what it is.\n\nDo you remember your first time on a plane?\n\nYes, in The Netherlands. We had domestic flights, I must have been around five years old. I was on a trip with my grandparents, about 100km. The second time was when I was around 13, the first big trip I went with my family to the United States (US).\n\nDid you know you\u2019d get here?\n\nIt was a coincidence, opportunistic even. I was in college in The Netherlands, doing my Master's thesis and needed an internship. My roommate worked at KLM and he recommended an internship there, and voila. Here we are.\n\nWhat was your biggest culture shock in Kenya?\n\nI have experienced different cultures in my career and wasn\u2019t too worried about it. Kenyans and the Dutch are not so different, sometimes, perhaps not everybody says things directly here but in general people speak their minds.\n\nIf you were guaranteed success would this still be the career you chose?\n\nYes. I have been lucky in my 12 years at KLM. I have spent a decade outside France, experiencing different people and cultures. I have been privileged.\n\nWhat\u2019s the one place you\u2019ve gone to that has stayed with you?\n\nAtlanta in the US. Being brought up as a child in the 90s in Western Europe, American pop culture seemed the coolest place to be. I was very excited but it was a bit of a letdown when I experienced it, haha! But Kenya has been great too, to live in the vibrancy of Nairobi and the nature sceneries just hours outside the city.\n\nDid you pick up any pop culture tendencies in your sojourn in the States?\n\nIt was a bit of a disappointment, from my perspective [chuckles].\n\nWhat makes you, you?\n\nHard questions now, eh haha! I am an open-minded, laid-back guy, not easily stressed looking for pragmatic solutions in day-to-day life\u2014both at work and in my private life. I try not to worry too much; I like to know where we are going but the way to get there is open.\n\nYou seem quite analytical.\n\nIt depends on where you work in the airline. I have worked longer in the commercial side of the airline\u2014pricing\u2014and I have enjoyed figuring out how to make the money, and how to price the tickets. The other side is about safety and procedures to guarantee safe and reliable operations and good customer focus.\n\nHow have you remained spontaneous in your life?\n\nMy family and I like to go out in nature. We have two small children and two dogs, and on the weekends we settle in and drive to the Nairobi National Park or outside the city.\n\nAre you a bush or a beach person?\n\nHmm. In the end, I\u2019ll have to go with bush.\n\nWho is the dog person between you and your wife?\n\nWe both are! I have always had a dog, even before I was born, we had a dog in the family. The first chance we got when we were living together with my wife, we got a dog.\n\nWhat have the dogs taught you?\n\nDogs live extremely in the moment. They only see what is happening at that moment in your life, and they are very reactive to behaviour in general. They have taught me you get back what you give immediately. I believe that is also true in business.\n\nWhich is easier\u2014running a family or a business?\n\nSometimes running a business is easier because my position has a bit more weight than it does in the family.\n\nWhat kind of father are you?\n\nI like to give my children space. I give them boundaries and let them do their thing and find their way but let them know they can come to me when they have questions.\n\nWere you raised the same way?\n\nMy wife and I were raised with a bit more boundaries, perhaps that is why. [chuckles]\n\nWhat do you miss most about your childhood?\n\nI had a fortunate childhood. I had a lot of freedom within the boundaries, but it was such a free careless time. Sometimes you long for that freedom.\n\nHow are you remaining childlike now?\n\nI try not to worry too much about things I cannot control.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest insecurity as a father?\n\nIt is mostly a worry that something inevitable will happen. At one point I told my parents that I was not happy about a list of things [chuckles]. My wife and I talk about this: do you remember the point you started telling your parents what you were not happy about? I know my children will tell me too at some point, and it will always be the things you don\u2019t expect. So far, I can still defend my choices.\n\nMarius van der Ham poses for a picture after the interview on July 3, 2024. Francis Nderitu | Nation Photo credit: Francis Nderitu | Nation Media Group\n\nWhat is the one question you are asking yourself right now?\n\n[Long pause] The role I have now: are we as the men doing the right things for the teams we work with and does it align with what we want to achieve with the business? How can we improve? Am I being the person my family would like to sit at the table with?\n\nAre you a head or a heart person?\n\nMainly head. I like rationality and logic, but I have a heart family so that is complex.\n\nHow so?\n\nI have a very passionate wife, with much more heart, which is good. My son is three and my daughter is six years old, and she has a tendency to go for the heart more than the head at this point. It forces me to go a bit more to my heart; sometimes people give me feedback that I could use a bit more heart.\n\nIs it easy being a head person in a heart world?\n\nIt\u2019s my default, so it makes it easy but it doesn\u2019t always make me well-liked [chuckles].\n\nIs there a decision you made using the head when you should have gone with the heart?\n\nYou can adjust yourself to the situation, but what is the maximum? Maybe five percent? 10 percent? The 90 percent is you and if you force it, it wouldn\u2019t work. I think.\n\nWhat\u2019s the one thing you wish more people understood about you?\n\nI generally have the interest of everybody I work with at heart. When you ascend the corporate ladder, decisions get less popular and less easy. You get judged for that and it sometimes feels unfair. Generally, I can handle it but sometimes I think, why am I the bad guy here? I wish people would know that it comes from the best interests.\n\nThey say the higher you go, the lonelier it becomes. Is it the same for you?\n\nTo some extent. I have a good management team so we lean on each other for support. When you are the person who has to make the final decision, then it can seem a bit lonely.\n\nWhat do you do just for you as a man?\n\nI was never a sportsperson. Throughout my 30s, I got into general fitness, gym, and running which is what I like to do to relax.\n\nHow often do you run?\n\nI was training for the Lewa Marathon which unfortunately was cancelled. I do it once a week, but now I do more gyming. I have done half marathons, one or two marathons et al.\n\nWhat do you think about when you are working out?\n\nIt depends. Things just come up. When I am training, I am doing math\u2014I look at my pace, and try to calculate my distance and time taken. It\u2019s become my routine now. Sometimes, I get Eureka moments and great ideas while running, just like people who have ideas in the shower.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most boring part about running?\n\nThe hard part is getting out of the door, haha! It\u2019s not boring especially not here, because running in the Netherlands is just flat, no hills, but here, after every kilometre or so, there is a hill waiting for you [chuckles].\n\nHave you had a strange encounter on your drills?\n\nA lot of monkeys and dik-diks. That is why I was so excited about the Lewa Marathon. We try again next year; I hope our tickets are still valid, haha!\n\nHow do people show you love?\n\nI love being around friends, at a big table with drinks, having a conversation. I have had the same group of friends since high school, for over 30 years. We go away for a weekend yearly and the only thing we are looking for apart from the accommodation is a big table [chuckles]. We love that table where we can just talk.\n\nWhat do you bring to that table?\n\nI am a bit of a jokes guy. I keep it light and put the atmosphere in the group. But I also like it when we get into deep serious conversations, giving each other advice.\n\nWhat\u2019s a special memory you have shared with your friends that is close to your heart?\n\nWhen we were children, it was about getting our first jobs, as adults it was the drastic changes\u2014losing parents, et al. We live in different parts of the world, but at that table, we get each other.\n\nWhat matters less than you thought it would?\n\nYour title and position. If you don\u2019t act in a way that makes it easy to work with the people who make your life, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or claim to be.\n\nWhat have you finally come to terms with?\n\nThe easy answer is that perhaps I will not become a professional soccer player. At least, not anymore [chuckles]. I am an ambitious person, but I have learned that aiming for something and developing toward it is an achievement in itself. You don\u2019t need to achieve everything you set your mind on.\n\nWhat is the soundtrack of your life right now?\n\nGood one. I am a bit of a soft guy, so you'll find me watching a bit of romcom movies and my wife would be like, are those tears in your eyes? I would of course shake my head, haha! But in music, I am a rock guy, Guns N\u2019 Roses is my go-to band.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most romantic thing you\u2019ve done?\n\nYou are putting me on the spot here. Okay, without spilling everything, my wife and I struggled to have children, it took a long time and of course, it was a hard thing, especially for my wife. What I used to do was to write and hide little notes throughout the house, in her bag, and at her workplace. It was small and personal notes of encouragement, and in the end, it worked.\n\nIf you could tell me just one thing, what would you tell me?\n\nHave I not told you enough? [chuckles]. I don\u2019t know, Eddy.\n\nFair enough. Whom do you know that I should know?\n\nTough question! I am at my wit's end here. [long pause]\n\nOkay then, what do you know that I should know?",

    "title": "HMRC withheld offshore tax avoidance figures for UK\u2019s wealthy during election",
    "body": "Tax officials are under pressure this weekend to publish estimated figures on offshore tax avoidance by some of the country\u2019s wealthiest individuals after withholding the information in a report published during the election campaign.\n\nIn June 2022, Lucy Frazer, then financial secretary to the Treasury, pledged that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) would publish figures on the offshore tax gap, but the release of the figures has been repeatedly delayed. An HMRC report published on 20 June this year \u2013 four weeks after the election was called \u2013 estimated the tax gap to be \u00a339.8bn for the 2022-23 tax year. The tax gap is the difference between the amount of tax that should be collected and what has actually been paid.\n\nA breakdown of the figures of \u201cnon-compliance by UK residents failing to declare their offshore income\u201d was withheld by HMRC. Officials concluded that this \u201cadditional breakdown of the tax gap should not be released within the election period\u201d in line with guidance for civil servants.\n\nElection guidance for civil servants says that statistical activities should \u201cavoid competition with parliamentary candidates for the attention of the public\u201d.\n\nThe decision to withhold the estimated figures has been challenged by the investigative thinktank TaxWatch. It says that if HMRC concluded it was too controversial to publish the offshore tax gap figures, the publication of the other tax gap figures should also have been delayed.\n\nClaire Aston, director of TaxWatch, said: \u201cThe main political parties pledged in their election manifestos to raise more revenue by closing the tax gap, and given that, these figures should not have been held back.\u201d\n\nHMRC has been under pressure to estimate the size of the tax gap after figures disclosed to the independent thinktank Tax Policy Associates by HMRC in September 2021 revealed that UK taxpayers held nearly \u00a3570bn in tax havens. Officials said at the time that they hadn\u2019t produced any estimates of the amount of foreign financial accounts that hadn\u2019t been properly disclosed.\n\nA common reporting standard approved by the OECD in 2014 now enables the automatic exchange of financial information between partner countries to combat tax evasion. The standard under which nearly all UK residents with overseas bank accounts have the balance and interest reported annually to HMRC has provided an invaluable resource of new information to officials.\n\nSteven Porter, head of tax disputes and investigations at the law firm Pinsent Masons, said he was doubtful that there would be a \u201cpot of gold\u201d from offshore tax avoidance after the introduction of tougher penalties and the publicising of voluntary disclosure facilities. Porter said: \u201cThey may be some individuals who have stubbornly got their head in the sand, but I think they are a dying breed.\u201d\n\nHe said there may be some \u201clegacy\u201d offshore tax avoidance schemes, but he expected most of those to have been identified by HMRC. The total estimated gross tax gap for individuals who completed self-assessment tax returns was about \u00a32bn, he said, and the offshore tax gap was likely to be a proportion of that and relatively low.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It points out that the revenue lost due to tax avoidance in 2022-23 was \u00a31.8bn, or 0.2% of total theoretical liability. It said in a briefing last month: \u201cAmbitious targets are to be applauded but our advice to politicians of all parties is not to spend the money before it\u2019s been collected.\u201d\n\nAn HMRC spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a strong track record in tackling offshore non-compliance. Since the launch of our No Safe Havens strategy in 2019, we have secured almost \u00a3700m from offshore initiatives.\u201d",

    "title": "Meet Mercy and Anita \u2013 the African workers driving the AI revolution, for just over a dollar an hour",
    "body": "Mercy craned forward, took a deep breath and loaded another task on her computer. One after another, disturbing images and videos appeared on her screen. As a Meta content moderator working at an outsourced office in Nairobi, Mercy was expected to action one \u201cticket\u201d every 55 seconds during her 10-hour shift. This particular video was of a fatal car crash. Someone had filmed the scene and uploaded it to Facebook, where it had been flagged by a user. Mercy\u2019s job was to determine whether it had breached any of the company\u2019s guidelines that prohibit particularly violent or graphic content. She looked closer at the video as the person filming zoomed in on the crash. She began to recognise one of the faces on the screen just before it snapped into focus: the victim was her grandfather.\n\nMercy pushed her chair back and ran towards the exit, past rows of colleagues who looked on in concern. She was crying. Outside, she started calling relatives. There was disbelief \u2013 nobody else had heard the news yet. Her supervisor came out to comfort her, but also to remind her that she would need to return to her desk if she wanted to make her targets for the day. She could have a day off tomorrow in light of the incident \u2013 but given that she was already at work, he pointed out, she may as well finish her shift.\n\nNew tickets appeared on the screen: her grandfather again, the same crash over and over. Not only the same video shared by others, but new videos from different angles. Pictures of the car; pictures of the dead; descriptions of the scene. She began to recognise everything now. Her neighbourhood, around sunset, only a couple of hours ago \u2013 a familiar street she had walked along many times. Four people had died. Her shift seemed endless.\n\nWe spoke with dozens of workers just like Mercy at three data annotation and content moderation centres run by one company across Kenya and Uganda. Content moderators are the workers who trawl, manually, through social media posts to remove toxic content and flag violations of the company\u2019s policies. Data annotators label data with relevant tags to make it legible for use by computer algorithms. Behind the scenes, these two types of \u201cdata work\u201d make our digital lives possible. Mercy\u2019s story was a particularly upsetting case, but by no means extraordinary. The demands of the job are intense.\n\nModerators witness suicides, torture and rape \u2018almost every day \u2026 you normalise things that are just not normal\u2019\n\n\u201cPhysically you are tired, mentally you are tired, you are like a walking zombie,\u201d said one data worker who had migrated from Nigeria for the job. Shifts are long and workers are expected to meet stringent performance targets based on their speed and accuracy. Mercy\u2019s job also requires close attention \u2013 content moderators can\u2019t just zone out, because they have to correctly tag videos according to strict criteria. Videos need to be examined to find the highest violation as defined by Meta\u2019s policies. Violence and incitement, for instance, are a higher violation than simple bullying and harassment \u2013 so it isn\u2019t enough to identify a single violation and then stop. You have to watch the whole thing, in case it gets worse.\n\n\u201cThe most disturbing thing was not just the violence,\u201d another moderator told us, \u201cit was the sexually explicit and disturbing content.\u201d Moderators witness suicides, torture and rape \u201calmost every day\u201d, commented the same moderator; \u201cyou normalise things that are just not normal.\u201d Workers in these moderation centres are continually bombarded with graphic images and videos, and given no time to process what they are witnessing. They\u2019re expected to action between 500 and 1,000 tickets a day. Many reported never feeling the same again: the job had made an indelible mark on their lives. The consequences can be devastating. \u201cMost of us are damaged psychologically, some have attempted suicide \u2026 some of our spouses have left us and we can\u2019t get them back,\u201d commented one moderator who had been let go by the company.\n\n\u201cThe company policies were even more strenuous than the job itself,\u201d remarked another. Workers at one of the content moderation centres we visited were left crying and shaking after witnessing beheading videos, and were told by management that at some point during the week they could have a 30-minute break to see a \u201cwellness counsellor\u201d \u2013 a colleague who had no formal training as a psychologist. Workers who ran away from their desks in response to what they\u2019d seen were told they had committed a violation of the company\u2019s policy because they hadn\u2019t remembered to enter the right code on their computer indicating they were either \u201cidle\u201d or on a \u201cbathroom break\u201d \u2013 meaning their productivity scores could be marked down accordingly. The stories were endless: \u201cI collapsed in the office\u201d; \u201cI went into a severe depression\u201d; \u201cI had to go to hospital\u201d; \u201cthey had no concern for our wellbeing\u201d. Workers told us that management was understood to monitor hospital records to verify whether an employee had taken a legitimate sick day \u2013 but never to wish them better, or out of genuine concern for their health.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018By using AI products we are directly inserting ourselves into the lives of workers dispersed across the globe.\u2019 Photograph: Frank Nowikowski/Alamy\n\nJob security at this particular company is minimal \u2013 the majority of workers we interviewed were on rolling one- or three-month contracts, which could disappear as soon as the client\u2019s work was complete. They worked in rows of up to a hundred on production floors in a darkened building, part of a giant business park on the outskirts of Nairobi. Their employer was a client of Meta\u2019s, a prominent business process outsourcing (BPO) company with headquarters in San Francisco and delivery centres in east Africa where insecure and low-income work could be distributed to local employees of the firm. Many of the workers, like Mercy herself, had once lived in the nearby Kibera slum \u2013 the largest urban slum in Africa \u2013 and were hired under the premise that the company was helping disadvantaged workers into formal employment. The reality is that many of these workers are too terrified to question management for fear of losing their jobs. Workers reported that those who complain are told to shut up and reminded that they could easily be replaced.\n\nWhile many of the moderators we spoke to were Kenyan, some had migrated from other African countries to work for the BPO and assist Meta in moderating other African languages. A number of these workers spoke about being identifiable on the street as foreigners, which added to their sense of being vulnerable to harassment and abuse from the Kenyan police. Police harassment wasn\u2019t the only danger they faced. One woman we interviewed described how members of a \u201cliberation front\u201d in a neighbouring African country found names and pictures of Meta moderators and posted them online with menacing threats, because they disagreed with moderation decisions that had been made. These workers were terrified, of course, and went to the BPO with the pictures. The company informed them they would see about enhancing security at the production facilities; aside from that, they said, there was nothing else they could do \u2013 the workers should just \u201cstay safe\u201d.\n\nMost of us can hope never to experience the inhumane working conditions endured by Mercy and her colleagues. But data work of this kind is performed by millions of workers in different circumstances and locations around the world. At this particular centre, some of the working conditions changed after our research was conducted. However large companies such as Meta tend to have multiple outsourced providers of moderation services who compete for the most profitable contracts from the company. This data work is essential for the functioning of the everyday products and services we use \u2013 from social media apps to chatbots and new automated technologies. It\u2019s a precondition for their very existence \u2013 were it not for content moderators constantly scanning posts in the background, social networks would be immediately flooded with violent and explicit material. Without data annotators creating datasets that can teach AI the difference between a traffic light and a street sign, autonomous vehicles would not be allowed on our roads. And without workers training machine learning algorithms, we would not have AI tools such as ChatGPT.\n\nOne such worker we spoke to, Anita, worked for a BPO in Gulu, the largest city in northern Uganda. Anita has been working on a project for an autonomous vehicle company. Her job is to review hour after hour of footage of drivers at the wheel. She\u2019s looking for any visual evidence of a lapse in concentration, or something resembling a \u201csleep state\u201d. This assists the manufacturer in constructing an \u201cin-cabin behaviour monitoring system\u201d based on the driver\u2019s facial expressions and eye movements. Sitting at a computer and concentrating on this footage for hours at a time is draining. Sometimes, Anita feels the boredom as a physical force, pushing her down in her chair and closing her eyelids. But she has to stay alert, just like the drivers on her screen. In return for 45 hours of intense, stressful work a week \u2013 possibly with unpaid overtime on top \u2013 annotators can expect to earn in the region of 800,000 Ugandan shillings a month, a little over US$200 or approximately $1.16 per hour.\n\nOn the production floor, hundreds of data annotators sit in silence, lined up at rows of desks. The setup will be instantly familiar to anyone who\u2019s worked at a call centre \u2013 the system of management is much the same. The light is dimmed in an attempt to reduce the eye strain that results from nine hours of intense concentration. The workers\u2019 screens flicker with a constant stream of images and videos requiring annotation. Like Anita, workers are trained to identify elements of the image in response to client specifications: they may, for example, draw polygons around different objects, from traffic lights to stop signs and human faces.\n\nView image in fullscreen The countryside near Gulu, Uganda: content moderators are often fleeing rural poverty or urban slums. Photograph: Alan Gignoux/Alamy\n\nEvery aspect of Anita and her fellow annotators\u2019 working lives is digitally monitored and recorded. From the moment they use the biometric scanners to enter the secure facilities, to the extensive network of CCTV cameras, workers are closely surveilled. Every second of their shift must be accounted for according to the efficiency-monitoring software on their computer. Some workers we spoke to even believe managers cultivate a network of informers among the staff to make sure that attempts to form a trade union don\u2019t sneak under the radar.\n\nWorking constantly, for hours on end, is physically and psychologically draining. It offers little opportunity for self-direction; the tasks are reduced to their simplest form to maximise the efficiency and productivity of the workers. Annotators are disciplined into performing the same routine actions over and over again at top speed. As a result, they experience a curious combination of complete boredom and suffocating anxiety at the same time. This is the reality at the coalface of the AI revolution: people working under oppressive surveillance at furious intensity just to keep their jobs and support their families.\n\nBy using AI products we are directly inserting ourselves into the lives of workers dispersed across the globe\n\nWhen we think about the world of AI development our minds might naturally turn to engineers working in sleek, air-conditioned offices in Silicon Valley. What most people don\u2019t realise is that roughly 80% of the time spent on training AI consists of annotating datasets. Frontier technologies such as autonomous vehicles, machines for nanosurgery and drones are all being developed in places like Gulu. As tech commentator Phil Jones puts it: \u201cIn reality, the magic of machine learning is the grind of data labelling.\u201d This is where the really time-consuming and laborious work takes place. There is a booming global marketplace for data annotation, which was estimated to be worth $2.22bn in 2022 and is expected to grow at around 30% each year until it reaches over $17bn in 2030. As AI tools are taken up in retail, healthcare and manufacturing \u2013 to name just a few sectors that are being transformed \u2013 the demand for well-curated data will increase by the day.\n\nView image in fullscreen The majority of workers in the global south work in the informal jobs sector. Photograph: Yannick Tylle/Getty Images\n\nToday\u2019s tech companies can use their wealth and power to exploit a deep division in how the digital labour of AI work is distributed across the globe. The majority of workers in countries in the global south work in the informal sector. Unemployment rates remain staggeringly high and well-paid jobs with employment protections remain elusive for many. Vulnerable workers in these contexts are not only likely to work for lower wages; they will also be less ready to demand better working conditions, because they know how easily they can be replaced. The process of outsourcing work to the global south is popular with businesses not because it provides much-needed economic opportunities for the less well off, but because it provides a clear route to a more tightly disciplined workforce, higher efficiency and lower costs.\n\nBy using AI products we are directly inserting ourselves into the lives of workers dispersed across the globe. We are connected whether we like it or not. Just as drinking a cup of coffee implicates the coffee drinker in a global production network from bean to cup, we should all understand how using a search engine, a chatbot \u2013 or even something as simple as a smart robot vacuum \u2013 sets in motion global flows of data and capital that connect workers, organisations and consumers in every corner of the planet.\n\nMany tech companies therefore do what they can to hide the reality of how their products are actually made. They present a vision of shining, sleek, autonomous machines \u2013 computers searching through large quantities of data, teaching themselves as they go \u2013 rather than the reality of the poorly paid and gruelling human labour that both trains them and is managed by them.\n\nBack in Gulu, Anita has just arrived home from work. She sits outside with her children in plastic chairs under her mango tree. She\u2019s tired. Her eyes start to close as the sun falls below the horizon. The children go to bed, and she will not be long after them. She needs to rest before her 5am start tomorrow, when she will be annotating again.\n\nNobody ever leaves the BPO willingly \u2013 there\u2019s nothing else to do. She sees her ex-colleagues when she\u2019s on her way to work, hawking vegetables on the market or trying to sell popcorn by the side of the road. If there were other opportunities, people would seize them. She just has to keep her head down, hit her targets, and make sure that whatever happens, she doesn\u2019t get laid off. Maybe another project will come in; maybe she could change to a new workflow. That would be a relief, something a bit different. Maybe labelling streets, drawing outlines around signs and trying to work out what it would be like to live at the other end of the lens, in a country with big illuminated petrol signs and green grass lawns.\n\nThis is an edited extract from Feeding the Machine: The Hidden Human Labour Powering AI, by James Muldoon, Mark Graham and Callum Cant (Canongate \u00a320).

    "title": "Thames, Tata, Shein \u2013 it won\u2019t be business as usual for Labour\u2019s Jonathan Reynolds",
    "body": "If Jonathan Reynolds was expecting a honeymoon period as the new business secretary, a glance at the mounting list of issues that require his attention will quash that idea. From a potential renationalisation to angry steelworkers and posties, Reynolds has an overflowing in-tray.\n\nSo acute are some of the problems that Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, Sue Gray, prepared an internal dossier, described as \u201cSue\u2019s shit list\u201d by some, which included the potential collapse of Thames Water among other issues including failing councils and prison overcrowding. Here, we examine some of Reynolds\u2019s most pressing priorities.\n\nTata Steel\u2019s job losses\n\nReynolds is expected to meet executives from Indian-owned Tata Steel as early as Monday. In an awkward twist of timing, the first of two blast furnace closures at its vast Port Talbot steelworks took place on Friday, with the second due in September \u2013 after strike action was narrowly avoided \u2013 putting 2,800 jobs under threat.\n\nTata hopes Labour will honour a \u00a3500m subsidy, part of \u00a33bn pledged to the industry, raising hopes that jobs can be protected as a new electric arc furnace is built on the site, to be finished in 2027.\n\nChris Rowley, an emeritus professor at Bayes business school, is not optimistic. \u201cThe recent threat of strike action ended maybe because of a belief and hope that the election of Labour will persuade the owners to keep a furnace operating until the future one is actually built,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSadly, without the new government offering serious amounts of new money, it seems more likely that the best the talks will result in is shifting deckchairs on the deck.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Labour has been briefed on the peril faced by another industrial stalwart, the Short Brothers factory in Belfast, which is caught up in the fallout from Boeing\u2019s $4.7bn takeover of Short\u2019s owner, Spirit Aerosystems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Thaes Water is labouring under more than \u00a315bn of debt. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters\n\nThames Water\u2019s troubles\n\nBy calling a surprise July election, Rishi Sunak has inadvertently ensured that the unfolding troubles at Thames Water \u2013 and its potential temporary nationalisation \u2013 will receive significant focus during Labour\u2019s first week.\n\nInvestors and executives had been keenly awaiting a draft view on water companies\u2019 five-year business plans from the industry regulator, Ofwat, in June but its price-review announcement was delayed by the election and will now take place on Thursday.\n\nThe review will indicate by how much Thames will be allowed to raise bills, and whether its \u00a319.7bn investment plan, intended in part to fix leaky pipes and prevent sewage spills, will be approved.\n\nBefore that, Thames will announce its annual results on Tuesday, laying bare the state of its tattered finances. Its chief executive, Chris Weston, may face questions over the board\u2019s handling of the situation, after the Guardian revealed that it had approved a \u00a3150m dividend just hours before announcing that shareholders had U-turned on \u00a3500m of pledged funding.\n\nLabour could soon be forced to decide whether to temporarily nationalise Britain\u2019s biggest water company, which is creaking under \u00a315.6bn of debt, the bulk of which could be added to the public purse. Reynolds has said there \u201cshould be a solution\u201d that avoids nationalisation, without specifying what \u2013 although it could involve a mixture of public and private money.\n\nRoyal Mail takeover\n\nLabour has appeared relatively passive about the news that the biggest shareholder in Royal Mail\u2019s parent company, the Czech billionaire Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, is planning to take the 508-year-old postal group private.\n\nInternational Distributions Services\u2019 board recommended shareholders accept the 370p offer from K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s EP Group, just weeks after saying that his original 320p offer significantly undervalued the group. The \u00a33.57bn bid \u00adrepresents a premium to the price before the takeover interest emerged, and to the 330p the group was privatised at in 2013, but is far lower than highs witnessed during the pandemic.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The regulator is due to update on its work later this summer. Moreover, the takeover would have to clear national security checks \u2013 a process K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd has successfully ridden out before. He has also faced scrutiny over his business links raised in a Guardian investigation. The deal is also expected to load \u00a32.9bn of fresh debt, on top of \u00a32bn of existing loans, on to the company.\n\nReynolds will be under pressure to show the government has carefully considered the deal before allowing it to proceed.\n\nView image in fullscreen Royal Mail\u2019s parent company is the subject of a \u00a33.5bn bid. Photograph: PA Images/Alamy\n\nShein\u2019s \u00a350bn listing\n\nDonald Tang, the executive chairman of the China-founded online fashion retailer, could be in the UK this week as the company prepares to list in London. Its executives have already met Labour MPs and received an indication of support for its listing, stating that \u201craising investment\u201d is among its \u201cmissions for government\u201d.\n\nHowever, the flotation has faced strong headwinds: from questions over Shein\u2019s valuation and alleged labour malpractices to an EU plan to impose import duty on cheap goods. Shein pursued a London \u00adlisting after ambitions for a US listing were seemingly frustrated by US legislators.\n\nReynolds will need to make it clear that Labour will not simply wave any listing through, while at the same time the City fights to \u00adprotect its status on the world financial stage in the face of an exodus of stock-market big names.\n\nIndustrial action\n\nLabour\u2019s traditional union-friendly stance could point to some \u00adresolution in long-running public sector pay disputes. A standoff in the rail industry has dragged on for more than two years, with train drivers in the Aslef union the remaining holdouts. While there are no immediate strikes planned, further action could be called unless there is a swift resolution.\n\nSeparately, the president of the TUC, Matt Wrack, has called for a summit with unions in the next few days to ensure Labour moves quickly to improve workers\u2019 rights.",

    "body": "Labour has approached a former Conservative minister to help steer through its proposals to bulldoze planning rules, with a flurry of changes expected within days to \u201cget Britain building\u201d millions of new homes.\n\nNick Boles, who was a planning minister in David Cameron\u2019s coalition government, has been approached for a review of the UK\u2019s National Planning Policy Framework, with the aim of making it easier to build homes, laboratories, digital infrastructure and gigafactories.\n\nStarmer is preparing to announce immediate changes to planning regulations as early as next week, including reinstating mandatory targets for local authorities to build more homes and making it easier to build on green belt land.\n\nNick Boles\n\nLabour is also planning to launch a consultation to decide where to build a series of new towns, with the aim of selecting sites by the end of the year.\n\nRachel Reeves, the new chancellor, has put planning reform at the heart of her growth plans, arguing that none of the party\u2019s broader housebuilding and infrastructure plans will work without it.\n\nParty sources said that Boles, who switched his allegiance from the Tories to Labour in late 2022 shortly after Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget, could be made a \u201cplanning tsar\u201d to help pilot a broad-ranging review of the system.\n\nBoles, who made his name as a minister by pushing for wide-ranging planning reform, has criticised the Conservative party for dropping the agenda under pressure from backbench MPs.\n\nLabour has promised to restore the requirement for local authorities to hit population-based housing targets, which was dropped last year by Michael Gove when he was housing secretary.\n\nMore recently Boles has been advising Starmer\u2019s shadow cabinet on its preparations for government. A Labour source told PoliticsHome earlier this year: \u201cWhile there\u2019s still much work to be done to win a general election, we owe it to the public to ensure we\u2019re prepared to govern, given we\u2019d inherit a complete mess from the Tories. Leaning on the expertise of those who have been at the heart of government is an important part of that work.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And within months, it was clear to all of us on the Conservative [benches that] whenever Labour got its act together \u2026 to a point where it was poised to return to government, Rachel Reeves would be close to the very top of it.\n\nLaunching one of the most radical shake-ups for planning regulation in decades could prove politically risky for Labour, with the changes likely to pave the way for construction projects that could prove locally unpopular.\n\nSuccessive governments have struggled to make changes amid stiff opposition. However, the party hopes that by moving early in his premiership, fresh from a landslide victory, and building a broader base of political support, Starmer can give the shake-up more chance of making progress.\n\nIt is also expected to take time for changes in regulations to have an impact on construction, adding to the urgency of the changes should Labour want to be able to point to a track record of housing delivery come the next general election in 2029.\n\nIn its manifesto Labour said it would make changes to forge ahead with new roads, railways, reservoirs, and other nationally significant infrastructure. It would also set out new national policy statements to prioritise construction projects.",

    "body": "Keir Starmer brought back senior ministers from the New Labour government on Saturday night, as he announced further additions to his team.\n\nFormer cabinet minister Douglas Alexander, who returned as an MP at the election, was made a trade minister, while Jacqui Smith, who served as home secretary under Gordon Brown, was handed a peerage and made an education minister.\n\nStarmer\u2019s willingness to bring back figures with government experience is set to continue, with suggestions that former health secretary Alan Milburn will be handed a role in pushing through NHS reforms.\n\nIt comes after Starmer demonstrated a willingness to bring in outside expertise for his ministerial ranks, in an apparent return to Gordon Brown\u2019s attempt to build a \u201cgovernment of all the talents\u201d.\n\nHe has appointed former chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance as science minister, rehabilitation campaigner and businessman James Timpson as prisons minister and Richard Hermer, an expert on international law, as his attorney general.\n\nHermer\u2019s appointment, welcomed by senior legal figures, comes as Starmer is likely to need regular advice on the Gaza conflict. Hermer was among a group of Jewish lawyers, including former president of the UK supreme court Lord Neuberger, to write a letter warning that international law must guide Israel\u2019s response to Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack.\n\nThe letter stated that Hamas\u2019s actions \u201cwere not simply a moral outrage but an egregious violation of all norms of international law\u201d.\n\nIt said that Israel had a clear right in international law to respond in self-defence and a duty to defend its citizens, but added: \u201cTo be clear, collective punishment is prohibited by the laws of war. Equally, international law requires combatants to ensure minimum destruction to civilian life and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAdam Wagner, a human rights lawyer who co-signed the letter with Hermer, described him as \u201can international law expert [who] has lived and breathed human rights law since the Human Rights Act arrived\u201d.\n\nSir Jonathan Jones, the former Treasury solicitor and permanent secretary of the government legal department, described it as an \u00ad\u201cexcellent appointment\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Patrick Vallance, who was one of the government\u2019s most senior advisers during the Covid pandemic, is the new science minister. Photograph: James Manning/PA\n\nHe said: \u201cRichard Hermer is an extremely experienced KC with the highest reputation. I have no doubt he will take very seriously the attorney general\u2019s vital role of upholding the rule of law in government.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hermer\u2019s arrival has meant sidelining Emily Thornberry, the London Labour MP who had held the role in opposition.\n\nStarmer\u2019s allies believe that appointments to a \u201cgovernment of all the talents\u201d, or \u201cgoats\u201d, will demonstrate that the prime minister intends to lead in a non-ideological way.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Observed Free weekly newsletter Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lord Jones later complained that being a junior minister had been \u201cone of the most dehumanising and depersonalising experiences a human being can have\u201d.\n\nOthers caused political embarrassment for the government.

    "body": "Standing in front of a Soviet-era industrial elevator, ready to descend 2,000ft for a gruelling six-hour shift at a coalmine in eastern Ukraine, Ludmyla Vashkatova looked unfazed.\n\nThe last thing she saw before stepping into the metal cage and plunging into darkness with dozens of other miners was a towering sign urging workers to take care. \u201cYou are awaited at home,\u201d it read, a stark reminder of the perils working at a frontline mine in the heavily shelled city of Pokrovsk.\n\n\u201cAt first, going underground was scary, but you soon get used to it,\u201d said Vashkatova, 49, as bare-chested workers emerging from the night shift, their faces darkened by coal dust and their bodies drenched in sweat, passed by her.\n\nVladimir Putin\u2019s invasion, which saw hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men serve at the front, has pushed women like Vashkatova down into the mines, taking up traditionally male jobs to keep the country\u2019s economy going.\n\nNearly three-quarters of Ukrainian employers have complained of workforce shortages, according to a recent study, and in Kyiv intervals between metro trains have increased due to a worker shortage, with up to 10% of the workforce mobilised. Nationwide, there is a 30% deficiency in bus drivers.\n\nA former village school teacher in the eastern Donetsk region, Vashkatova lost her job last year when relentless Russian shelling forced her pupils to turn to online schooling.\n\nWhile scrolling online, she saw an ad on Facebook from Ukraine\u2019s largest steelmaker, Metinvest, for a job at the Pokrovsk mine, seeking workers to operate machines underground.\n\n\u201cThe pay is good and stable,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is quite rare these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a teacher but now I am a student again. It is an interesting process,\u201d Vashkatova said, adding that she had a few weeks left of training before she could operate the machinery unsupervised.\n\nTo enable women to work underground, the Ukrainian government lifted a law that had previously prohibited women from working in \u201charmful or dangerous\u201d conditions.\n\nView image in fullscreen Violetta Loevska, right, says she sees it as her duty to keep the mine running after her uncle was sent to the front. Photograph: J\u0119drzej Nowicki/The Guardian\n\nSome have taken the opportunity with open hands as jobs in the battle-ravished region dried up.\n\nAmid the rumble of rail carts and hum of machinery in the dark and dusty labyrinthine network of tunnels, Marina Vykhrevna, 50, stood alongside a group of male workers inside the mine.\n\nHaving spent three decades working at a mine above ground sorting dry coal, she welcomed the opportunity the war gave her to train as a quality control inspector underground.\n\nHer salary had doubled to 19,000 (\u00a3360), and with the influx of women, a bond of camaraderie had formed. \u201cI think it\u2019s great more women join. The girls are supporting each other,\u201d Vykhrevna said.\n\nShe added that her female friends were initially surprised when she told them about her job, but have since inquired about available positions.\n\nUkraine has the world\u2019s sixth-largest coal reserve, with 90% of it located in the Donbas region, where mining has long been the lifeline for many towns and cities.\n\nNearly everyone at the mine in Pokrovsk, a city with a prewar population of about 61,000, has a relative who was fighting to defend the country.\n\nVioletta Loevska, 21, who recently started working at the mine measuring methane levels, said she saw it as her \u201cduty\u201d to keep it operating, especially since her uncle who worked at the mine had been sent to the front.\n\n\u201cEveryone understands that there just aren\u2019t enough men left. If we don\u2019t work here, who will?\u201d she said as she walked down a tunnel.\n\nDown in the mine, Loevska stressed, gender did not matter, dismissing the notion of lingering stigma surrounding taking on traditionally male roles.\n\n\u201cI knew very well what I was signing up for. Women can do the job just as well as men. All that matters is keeping other miners safe.\u201d\n\nBlue-collar industries heavily dominated by sturdy working-age men, such as mining, transport and construction are disproportionately affected by mobilisation. These vital sectors are expected to face further workforce depletion after president Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s decision to lower the conscription age to 26.\n\nBut in the east, shortages are especially acute, with many families fleeing abroad or to the relative safety of western Ukraine.\n\nSince the start of the war, 915 out of 6,578 male workers at Metinvest\u2019s Pokrovsk mine have joined the armed forces, while others have left the region, said Serhiy Stepanenko, the head of the mine\u2019s human resources department.\n\nStepanenko said that about 30 women have so far taken up jobs underground, while some women have started working in traditionally male-dominated roles in logistics and transportation.\n\nView image in fullscreen Women such as Tetiana Lishchenko are learning to drive a truck, which was a male-dominated role. Photograph: J\u0119drzej Nowicki/The Guardian\n\nBut he said many of the most physically demanding positions would remain closed off to women. \u201cThe worker\u2019s deficit is problematic and female employment won\u2019t fix it,\u201d Stepanenko said, adding that the mine has been forced to change the production outlook this year based on the available personnel.\n\nBeyond the numerous usual hazards and long-term health risks of working in a Soviet-era coalmine \u2013 an industry plagued by deadly accidents \u2013 miners in Pokrovsk also face the threat of constant Russian bombardment. The mine is located just 15 miles from the battlefield, and Russian forces have been slowly creeping closer to Pokrovsk in recent weeks.\n\nThree days after the Guardian descended into the Pokrovsk mine, Russia shelled another site in the nearby city of Selydove, setting several production facilities on fire. The attack cut electricity at the mine, trapping 53 miners for hours before they were evacuated.\n\n\u201cOf course we worry about the fighting. All we can do is follow the safety protocols as best as we can,\u201d said Loevska.\n\nBut the shortage of men is felt far beyond the frontlines, where the constant noise of rocket alarms and artillery shells has become a fixture in daily life.\n\nTo tackle some of these challenges, the Ukrainian government and independent organisations have set up fast-track retraining programmes for female workers across the country.\n\nOn a recent morning on the outskirts of Kyiv, a group of women gathered for a truck driving course organised by the NGO Reskilling.\n\n\u201cTruck driving was traditionally a male profession, but I have always wanted to experience what it\u2019s like to be behind the wheel of such a powerful machine,\u201d said Valentyna Kaistreno, who lived in Mariupol before Russia occupied the city, as she stepped outside a giant truck.\n\nKaistreno noted that for a long time, women were expected to stay at home and take care of their children.\n\n\u201cBut now, the situation in the country has changed, and attitudes are evolving too.\u201d",

    "title": "Tesla won\u2019t free up use of its batteries, leaving owners unable to reap full benefits",
    "body": "Australian owners of Tesla batteries could miss out on lucrative revenue streams because the US energy giant restricts the devices\u2019 ability to interact locally with third parties and authorities continue to dither over setting and enforcing standards.\n\nAn increasing number of products from air conditioners to hot water heaters and solar panels can be controlled remotely, and consumers can sign deals rewarding them for altering power usage during peak load periods, including supplying electricity to grid.\n\nTesla is required in many US states to enable so-called interoperability of batteries. However, the company disables that capability in its main storage product \u2013 the $15,000 Powerwall 2 battery \u2013 it sells to Australians, industry participants say.\n\nThey say federal and state governments should impose US mandates on Tesla and other battery suppliers according to an international standard \u2013 IEEE1547-2018 Clause 10 \u2013 to maximise future benefits to consumers and the grid, and firms restricting utility should be excluded from rebates, such as New South Wales\u2019 subsidy program of as much as $2,400 a battery.\n\n\u201cBatteries that do not offer their full performance via an open standards-based, non-cloud control port are too easily locked into a particular business model to the detriment of their owners,\u201d said Dean Spaccavento, the chief executive of Reposit Power.\n\nGovernments should specify and enforce a local control interface for any battery installed as part of their rebate programs, he said. Spaccavento said his firm does not bundle Tesla batteries into its services because of the US company\u2019s stance.\n\nGuardian Australia has sought comment from Tesla.\n\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator highlighted the potential for coordinated consumer energy resource (CER) storage in its grid blueprint released last week.\n\nFrom about 200 megawatts now, such storage will rise to 37 gigawatts by 2049-50, or two-thirds of the entire storage in the national electricity market. Without \u201ceffective orchestration of consumer batteries\u201d, the grid would need about $4.1bn in extra investment, Aemo\u2019s integrated system plan said.\n\n\u201cAs all batteries [Tesla] sell here are connected to their cloud, it is literally a remote software command that could switch the capability back on,\u201d an industry veteran said.\n\nIf the battery only has \u201ccloud control\u201d, devices that could be orchestrated will instead \u201cfight each other\u201d to the financial detriment of its owners and nullify its potential benefits for grid stability and other services, the veteran said. Authorities have had eight years to come up with appropriate standards.\n\nA spokesperson for Aemo said CER coordination and control was \u201ccritical to a least-cost transition\u201d, and \u201ccan only be achieved with effective interoperability\u201d of such assets as home batteries.\n\nThere is no requirement in Australia for Tesla to allow local third-party access, like in the US, they said. \u201cA number of processes\u201d were under way to review technical standards, access issues and consumer protections, they added.\n\nA spokesperson for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it was up to governments to impose interoperability or access obligations on battery suppliers.\n\n\u201cAny restrictions on access or product interoperability would only raise concerns under the Competition and Consumer Act where those restrictions lead to a substantially lessening of competition,\u201d they said.\n\nRichie Merzian, the acting chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, said \u201cconsumer energy in Australia has long been viewed by energy retailers as a problem to be managed rather than an opportunity to be embraced\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a result, Australia has a huge take-up of consumer energy products but very little thought, regulation or resourcing has come with this,\u201d Merzian said. \u201cA gradual phase-in of interoperability capabilities into the Australian product set will mean huge new benefits that people could only have dreamed of just a few years ago.\u201d\n\nCon Hristodoulidis, a policy director at Clean Energy Council, noted standards for the interoperability of consumer resources would hinge on a final report from the federal government.\n\n\u201cIt is important that households are empowered to make the right choice of home batteries and have greater flexibility to select service providers without experiencing higher software and hardware costs in so doing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, said: \u201cConsumer energy resources, including things like home batteries, will play an important role in Australia\u2019s energy transformation towards 82% renewables by 2030.\u201d\n\nHe said state and energy ministers were committed to reforming the National Consumer Energy Resources Roadmap to allow consumers to export more solar power to the grid and deliver nationally consistent standards in key areas, including vehicle to grid technologies.\n\nA spokesperson for NSW\u2019s energy department said it was engaging with industry stakeholders, including battery manufacturers, and \u201ccontinuing to finalise the details of the peak demand reduction scheme to ensure it delivers the best possible outcomes for all participants\u201d.",

    "body": "On social media videos, audiences throw packs of tissues around the cinema halls. Tearful TikToks from across Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore show friends leaving the cinema weeping. Thailand\u2019s latest hit film, How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies, has reduced audiences across south-east Asia to tears \u2013 and broken box office records.\n\nThe film, about a university dropout who offers to care for his terminally ill grandma, hoping to inherit her house, has reportedly earned 334m Thai baht ($9.1m) at the Thai box office and become the most successful Thai film ever in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.\n\nIt is the latest success story for films made in Thailand and south-east Asia, which, while Hollywood has grappled with strikes and production delays, have captured audiences across the region and boosted the cinema industry.\n\n\u201cCovid, and industry issues that impacted Hollywood product flow, have ushered [in] a period of growth for local and regional films, in some cases with record-breaking results,\u201d said Rance Pow, of Artisan Gateway, a film consultancy.\n\nIn Indonesia, the horror film KKN di Desa Penari (KKN in Dancer\u2019s Village) sold more than 10m tickets in 2022, according to local media, becoming the country\u2019s highest-grossing locally made film. The Vietnamese romance Mai, released in February, has become the highest-grossing Vietnam-produced film of all time at home and in North America and Europe, according to Deadline.\n\nA scene from KKN di Desa Penari, which became Indonesia\u2019s highest-grossing locally made film. Photograph: handout\n\nWhile screens are being closed down in the US, Indonesia\u2019s biggest chain, Cinema XXI, listed on the Indonesian stock exchange last year, while in Thailand new cinemas are being opened.\n\nRecent Thai successes were not necessarily made with large production budgets, nor did they receive government help prior to their release, said Dr Unaloam Chanrungmaneekul, an associate professor at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University. But they resonated with audiences because they were rooted in local culture and dealt with contemporary social issues, including the gap between generations.\n\n\u201cThey present a mix between comedy, fantasy and social realism \u2026. They show satirical scenes about Thai culture, politics, belief, and challenge Thai norms,\u201d she said.\n\nHow to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies explores the dynamics within a Thai Chinese family: the unequal treatment of sons and daughters, the gulf between young and old, the fading away of traditions and language.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why they [achieved] huge success in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, and also maybe other countries [with Chinese populations] \u2026 The cultural identity [of the films] is very deep and very clear,\u201d Unaloam said.\n\nWaritsara Panacharoensawad, 30, who reviews films on her social media channels as Aquabbiew, was among many who shared their tearful response to the movie online.\n\nShe saw parallels between the film and the experience in her own family, where her grandmother was cared for by her and her mother, and was moved by its nostalgic setting \u2013 scenes of grandma\u2019s home, piled full of things, and the memories of sleeping next to her grandmother or parents.\n\n\u201cThe movie is like a middleman, to talk between the young generation and the old generation,\u201d Waritsara said.\n\nIt also reflected social problems in the country, she added. A scene in which relatives take off their shoes and place them in a long line to mark their place in a never-ending hospital queue resonated. \u201cIt shows [the state of] the medical welfare here. If the grandma had been rich, I think she could have stayed [alive] longer.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Film Weekly Free newsletter Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "title": "I\u2019m hungry, cold and have multiple disabilities. Does Starmer\u2019s promise of real change include me? | Marie",
    "body": "When Keir Starmer stood on the steps of 10 Downing Street as our new prime minister, he spoke of hope and of a promise that things will change for the better. But hope is in short supply in my household. At the age of 44, I have never been this skint, this hungry, this cold or this worried.\n\nI am unable to work owing to multiple disabilities, and the past few months have been a very frightening time to be receiving benefits. While I understand people cheering the end of 14 years of the Conservatives, I am nervous that when Starmer promises change he is not thinking about people like me. In his victory speech he spoke of cleaners, builders, and nurses facing insecurity despite doing the right thing. I feel that insecurity every minute of every day, but simply cannot work because of my disabilities. That leaves me completely unable to make ends meet.\n\nPersonal independence payments (Pips) should cover the additional costs of my disabilities, such as a chiropractor to manage the pain of my fibromyalgia, or holistic therapy for my mental health. But the cost of living is so high they never stretch that far. The Conservative party even discussed replacing some of the support I receive with vouchers. This feels like a form of discrimination: it\u2019s demoralising to be trusted only with vouchers rather than money. I am glad to see the back of the Tories, but it\u2019s hard to feel excited about a Labour government when it has made no promises to invest in social security.\n\n\n\nI know many say we have to be patient, and that change will come. But my kids face empty food cupboards on a weekly basis. We cannot wait for this change. It needs to come now. The political debate over this election has been focused on immigration and pledges to support \u201chard-working Britons\u201d while people like me are left to scrabble to get by. What about people who are unwell and who can\u2019t work? When we do feature in political debate, it\u2019s only as a problem that needs fixing: cut our benefits, say the Conservatives; get us back to work says Labour.\n\nEvery day I wake up and try to think of ways to make ends meet. My situation is hopeless: I can\u2019t afford a weekly shop from the supermarket and have now gone two weeks without buying my own shampoo and conditioner. Instead I\u2019ve had to rely on charity. It wasn\u2019t even much better when I was working; in my job as an administrator, I still had to go to the food bank. Levels of social security payment leave families like mine below the poverty line, and yet we still hear comments far too often that imply people choose a life on benefits. But no one would choose this life, my life, and I want this to change, so that families everywhere can have a hope of something better. Families like mine, where no one is in work, have lost an average of \u00a35,500 a year since 2010.\n\nAnd disabled people often face additional costs. My health conditions mean I need to use the washing machine and shower more often than most people \u2013 as is the case with many disabled people \u2013 so capping the price of energy bills would really help. The benefit cap must also go, and free school meals should be universal. This is not asking a lot \u2013 just for our basic needs to be met. Starmer said on the steps of Downing Street that the work of change will begin immediately. I truly hope so. But for me to have trust in him, he must listen to people like me and change our our failing social security system to make a better future possible for us all.",

    "title": "Great Britain? by Torsten Bell \u2013 why Labour must move fast and fix things",
    "body": "Choose your fighter: mission-driven government or radical incrementalism? Evangelical academic or nerdy policy wonk? Economist Mariana Mazzucato\u2019s idea of reconceptualising government around a few long-term goals inspired Keir Starmer\u2019s five \u201cmissions\u201d. Former chief executive of the Resolution Foundation Torsten Bell suggests a more pragmatic approach, set out in this book, published midway through the election campaign. He has just become MP for Swansea West, and will be a key figure in Labour\u2019s Treasury. However, the new government will have to decide \u2013 in rhetoric and action \u2013 which is more convincing.\n\nBell\u2019s case for \u201cradical incrementalism\u201d rests on three pillars. First, that the UK is in deep trouble; we\u2019ve combined abysmal levels of productivity growth, resulting in stagnant real wages and slow growth in living standards, with persistently high levels of inequality and rising levels of severe deprivation. As he notes, \u201cthis should be enough to put to bed the zombie idea that Britain faces a trade-off between growth and equality: being \u2018more normal\u2019 means becoming more prosperous and more equal.\u201d\n\nSecond, the path to \u201cnormality\u201d requires a combination of relatively quick and modest policy shifts with longer-term strategies. From abolishing the two-child benefit cap, which would make a massive difference to the lives of hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged kids, to increasing our miserable levels of both private and public investment, Great Britain? is full of policy detail. Much of this \u2013 reforming the planning system so that we can build more houses, reducing the exploitation of lower paid and insecure workers, reforming the tax system so that it taxes richer and older people more and workers less \u2013 is well-trodden territory, largely reflects the consensus among economists and thinktanks, and is none the worse for that. Many of us would be much happier with this prospectus than Labour\u2019s timid and sometimes incoherent manifesto.\n\nAnd third \u2013 and this is perhaps the most important point of difference with the \u201cmission\u201d approach \u2013 many of these changes can and should be implemented quickly. In time, this incrementalism can and should add up to radical change, but we don\u2019t need a fully formulated roadmap to start the journey, and we can\u2019t afford to wait. Bell makes the argument for immediate, concrete change on both principled and political grounds: \u201cEarly victories will incrementally rebuild faith and break us out of the stagnation trap ... in time, higher public investment drives growth, but in the short term it means something almost as important: potholes that are filled in, rather than providing a daily, jolting reminder of the country\u2019s stagnation.\u201d\n\nThe subtext is clear. \u201cMissions\u201d are fine; but, as everyone who\u2019s ever worked on an \u201cinterdepartmental strategy\u201d knows, the risk is that a new government spends its first year setting up working groups, workshops, consultations, and evidence papers, culminating in a big set piece ministerial speech and the publication of a hefty policy document, after which everyone relaxes. Meanwhile, separately, the Treasury won\u2019t stump up the money, the pothole is still there, and the public\u2019s distrust of all politicians ratchets up yet another notch.\n\nAs a civil servant, I helped establish the Child Poverty Unit \u2013 which Labour has highlighted as the exemplar of \u201cmission-driven government\u201d in action. And I am convinced that there is no substitute for objectives, like ending child poverty, that are long-term, ambitious and directly impact people\u2019s lives. But Bell is right that unless government puts its own political capital, and our money, where its mouth is, they will ring hollow. That applies to all of Labour\u2019s missions, from net zero to the NHS to \u201cexpanding opportunity\u201d. Leaving the two-child limit \u2013 which Bell rightly excoriates \u2013 in place, not improving pay and conditions in social care, or failing to address unfair zero-hours contracts will undermine Labour\u2019s credibility from the start.\n\nLabour\u2019s six \u201cfirst steps\u201d suggest that they recognise this, but these range from the specific and quantifiable (more teachers and NHS appointments) to generic politician-speak (economic stability) to bureaucratic deckchair-shuffling (replacing the \u201cIllegal Migration Operation Command\u201d with a \u201cBorder Security Command\u201d). Bell argues convincingly that Labour needs to go further and faster to deliver concrete improvements in people\u2019s lives. As he concludes, \u201cProblems will not vanish overnight \u2013 yet, as we start investing in our own future, the clouds that hover over Britain will lift far more swiftly than we might realise.\u201d Keir Starmer should listen.",

    "title": "\u2018It\u2019s very troubling\u2019: thieves use vulnerable man to take out \u00a328,000 bank loan",
    "body": "The family of a deaf man who was groomed by a gang into taking out a \u00a328,000 business loan has demanded to know how a vulnerable person, with virtually no assets, could be marched into a Metro Bank, and allowed to borrow such a huge sum.\n\nPeter James*, who has special educational needs, and who only communicates through British Sign Language, was being chased by the bank\u2019s debt collectors, and facing possible bankruptcy, before Guardian Money became involved.\n\nHis case, one of the most unusual that we have featured in some time, raises questions about how banks treat people who need help communicating, and what safeguards are in place to stop them being taken advantage of.\n\nIt also highlights how difficult it can be to communicate with Metro Bank when things go wrong.\n\nThe story of what happened to James is somewhat muddled as it was almost four years ago, and the family has only learned exactly what happened in the past two weeks.\n\nIn 2020, James was taken to the Ilford branch of Metro Bank in London, where one of the people with him claimed to be acting on his behalf. There they opened a bank account in his name.\n\nOnce they had presented his ID and he had signed the forms, they disappeared along with his newly issued debit card.\n\nAt some point later, they applied for a business bounceback loan from the bank, and this was paid into the newly opened account.\n\nJames, who lives in a south London council flat with his wife, who is also deaf, had problems during lockdown when his identity was stolen. Covid support grants were applied for, according to his father-in-law, Steve Hall*. HMRC, he says, quickly realised these applications were nothing to do with his son-in-law, and stopped chasing him for repayments.\n\nIt advised him to get Cifas (Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System) registered, which acts as a warning to other lenders faced with credit or loan applications. That was not in place when the loan application was made to Metro Bank, and there were no alarm bells until default notices started arriving on James\u2019s doorstep in late 2021.\n\nThe family explained the situation to the bank. However, rather than accepting it had been defrauded, Hall says Metro Bank held his son-in-law responsible, steadfastly refusing to reveal any information about the loan, or how it was taken out, and continued to demand repayment.\n\nGetting the details out of my son-in-law has been difficult but it now looks as though he has been groomed by a gang Steve Hall\n\nThe family, who attended their local Metro Bank branch, and even issued several subject access requests for information that were all ignored, say they only learned the exact details after Guardian Money\u2019s intervention.\n\n\u201cI help my daughter and, inevitably, her husband, with their financial affairs, and initially thought this must be another case of identity theft,\u201d Hall says.\n\n\u201cGetting the details out of my son-in-law has been very difficult, but it now looks as though he has been groomed by a gang.\n\n\u201cThrough a relation of an old school contact he met \u2013 he doesn\u2019t even know his surname \u2013 he was promised some kind of work in a new business.\u201d\n\nHe was told to bring his passport for a meeting, was picked up from work in a Mercedes car and forced to hand over his phone.\n\nHe was then taken to the Ilford branch of Metro, where the account paperwork was processed.\n\nThroughout this, his contact did all the talking on his behalf, signing the instructions to him as they went. James says he had no idea a loan was being taken out, let alone one in his name.\n\n\u201cAt the end of all this, he says he was dropped back at the tube,\u201d Hall says. \u201cHe had to hand over the bank card in exchange for his phone, and the group disappeared with both the card and, we now know, \u00a328,000.\n\n\u201cPeter says that as he got out of the car, the person signed that he would contact him the next day about the work, told him to be careful and to keep his mouth shut. He never heard from him again.\u201d\n\nThis case would not be the first time a vulnerable person had been used by people purporting to be their friends, or by promising them well-paid work.\n\nView image in fullscreen Metro Bank agreed to write off the loan after the Guardian took up the case. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA\n\nWhat the family can\u2019t understand is how Metro decided he was worthy of such a loan. Hall says that while his son-in-law has a steady job, he lives in social housing, and has virtually no discernible assets, with the possible exception of two PlayStations.\n\nMeanwhile, the family has also questioned why staff at the branch did not ask to see any ID of the person who accompanied him.\n\n\u201cWhen we went to the Metro branch to try to get some answers, we all had to produce our ID, but it seems the person who was interpreting while this loan was taken out, didn\u2019t,\u201d Hall says.\n\n\u201cHow can a bank give such a large loan to an obviously vulnerable person without authenticating the person acting on their behalf. It is all very troubling.\u201d\n\nAfter Guardian Money took up the case, Metro Bank has agreed to write off the loan and will no longer be pursuing James.\n\nIt says this decision was made on the basis of the new information that has come to light, of which it was previously unaware.\n\nIt says: \u201cInvestigating this case revealed how unscrupulous scammers are \u2013 they will prey on anyone.\n\n\u201cWe would like to remind your readers to be wary of being rushed, or pressured, into opening financial accounts and credit cards, sharing personal details (passwords, account numbers, security numbers, passcodes, etc) and even handing over/transferring money. All of these are red flags for a fraud, in addition to the more obvious one of someone threatening you.\n\n\u201cIf you are in any doubt, contact your bank as soon as it is safe for you to do so, to share your concerns.\u201d\n\nIt says that it is not Metro Bank policy to ask for the ID of anyone attending a branch with one of its customers, even when that person is applying for a significant loan, meaning this could happen again.\n\nFor its part, the family has called on Metro to learn lessons from the case.\n\nUltimately, though, they are just delighted that they can put the matter behind them now that the loan has been written off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just paid my annual \u00a375 (subscription) to the Guardian, which seems a ludicrously low price to pay for such service,\u201d Hall says.\n\n* Names have been changed\n\nThe option of only being able to make big bank transfers when you are at home, or running any big payments past a close friend or relative, are among new tools to fight scammers that are being offered to customers of the digital bank Monzo.\n\nThere were almost 3m confirmed cases of payment fraud last year, with a combined value of \u00a31.2bn.\n\nAs well as authorised push payment (APP) scams, where someone is persuaded to transfer money to a fraudster, customers also need to be wary of shoulder surfing, where a thief watches for their phone password before swiping their device.\n\nMonzo\u2019s security controls will now let customers set up \u201cknown locations\u201d, which they will need to be in if they want to make a bank transfer or withdrawal over a limit of their choice. If anyone attempts a transfer outside those locations, it will be refused.\n\nView image in fullscreen Make sure no one can see when you enter your phone\u2019s password. Photograph: deepblue4you/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThe \u201ctrusted contacts\u201d tool will allow customers to set up family members or friends to check any transaction over their set minimum, while a secret QR code will let them verify their identity with an individual code stored on a different device or on paper.\n\nMonzo \u2013 which operates as an app-based service \u2013 says its security controls \u201cadd a much-needed moment of pause while in the process of transferring money out of an account, encouraging people to stop and think about whether they\u2019re being targeted by fraudsters\u201d.\n\nCustomers can choose whether to opt in to the controls or not, but if they do decide to use them, they must choose two so that there is a second backup check if the first fails for some reason.",

    "title": "VIP Taylor Swift ticket holders get obstructed view \u2013 are pricey packages worth the cash?",
    "body": "Complaints from Taylor Swift fans who paid \u00a3660 each for premium concert seats but say their views were blocked by stage equipment have thrown the spotlight on \u201cVIP\u201d tickets and exactly what you get for your money.\n\nWhile some will be surprised that anyone would pay more than \u00a3600 for a ticket and a few items of \u201cmerch\u201d, particularly in a cost of living crisis, pricey packages offering a supposedly once-in-a-lifetime experience are becoming increasingly common.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing growing fan demand for VIP experiences in the UK,\u201d the ticketing company Ticketmaster told Guardian Money.\n\nIt says 80% of VIP ticket buyers are aged over 40 but adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a growing interest among gen Z.\u201d\n\nTaylor Swift packages \u2013 good value?\n\nThe US megastar recently finished a string of huge UK dates and is coming back for five more at Wembley in August.\n\nLast Sunday, the Guardian\u2019s sister paper, the Observer, featured a letter from a reader who paid more than \u00a32,640 for four tickets for one of the concerts in Liverpool as a treat for their daughters. When they arrived, the reader says they found their view of the stage completely blocked by a tent and large items of technical equipment.\n\nView image in fullscreen Taylor Swift on stage at Wembley last month. Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management\n\nAs well as standing tickets costing either \u00a3110 or \u00a3172 and seats priced at between \u00a358 and \u00a3194, there were six different VIP packages on sale. Each offered a ticket (either seated or standing) plus the same set of \u201cexclusive\u201d merchandise, including a tote bag, four prints and VIP tour laminate. These packages ranged in price from \u00a3196 to \u00a3662. (All these prices are for the Wembley shows, although those for the other UK venues were very similar.)\n\nThe most expensive is the It\u2019s Been A Long Time Coming package, and this is the one the Observer reader bought for her daughters. It promised an \u201cunforgettable\u201d seat.\n\nMost, if not all, of the packages were quickly snapped up as soon as they went on sale in July last year, and therein lies the potential problem with these sorts of deals: fans are allocated a specific seat way before any detailed thought has been given to the stage configuration and where things such as the sound equipment and lighting rigs are going to be positioned.\n\nThe It\u2019s Been A Long Time Coming package appears to be the least good value if you assume it includes a top-price (\u00a3194 at Wembley) seated ticket, as that means you are effectively paying \u00a3466 for the gifts. That is, unless buyers were allocated tickets that the organisers claim are even better than the \u00a3194 ones.\n\nThe Ready For It package, meanwhile, cost Wembley buyers \u00a3277 each and included a \u00a3110 general admission standing ticket \u2013 so you are effectively paying \u00a3167 for the extras. But this package also includes \u201cearly entry\u201d, enabling fans to bag a prime spot, which some will rate as a valuable perk, although you only get a 30-minute head start.\n\nMoney-no-object meet and greets\n\nIn 2009, Britons were being offered Beyonc\u00e9 packages where you got to say hello to the superstar, have your photo taken with her and watch the concert from a front-row seat. The price: \u00a31,265 per person.\n\nView image in fullscreen John Lydon recently finished a UK spoken word tour. Photograph: Dylan Coulter/The Guardian\n\nOne of the priciest VIP meet-and-greet ticket packages currently on offer is for Ms Lauryn Hill and the Fugees, who are playing London (the O2) and Manchester (Co-op Live) in October. The cost is \u00a3885 and \u00a3879 respectively.\n\nSome gen Z-ers may be more tempted by the 21-year-old Italian-Norwegian singer Alessandra, best known for her Eurovision song contest 2023 track Queen of Kings, who is playing UK dates next February. VIP meet-and greet tickets for her London date at Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire are \u00a3121. You get goodies including access to the pre-show sound check and a photo opportunity using your phone \u201cso you can share straight to your socials\u201d.\n\nThe best-value package we found was for the former Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon \u2013 AKA Johnny Rotten \u2013 who this week finished a UK spoken word tour. For about \u00a390, fans got a VIP meet and greet including a photo opportunity and autograph, a goodie bag including a print of an original artwork by Lydon and a lanyard, and a best-in-the-house seat.\n\nWeird and wonderful gifts and experiences\n\nCyndi Lauper has to be the winner of this category. Fresh from her set at Glastonbury, she is selling tickets for a UK tour next February and offering a VIP ticket package costing up to \u00a3482. In addition to a message delivered via QR code, you get an Uber to and from the venue, a pre-gig \u201cexclusive on-stage photo\u201d (but without Lauper present) and the chance to check out her \u201cglam station and button-making station\u201d \u2013 whatever they are.\n\nView image in fullscreen Cyndi Lauper on stage at Glastonbury last month. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nFor those flushed with cash \u2026\n\nGeneral admission tickets for Kylie\u2019s London Hyde Park show next Saturday (13 July) currently cost \u00a3111 but if you like the idea of separate toilets away from the masses, there are a range of VIP ticket options offering those plus, usually, a closer view of the stage \u2026 priced at between \u00a3324 and \u00a3434.\n\nAt the cheaper end of the spectrum, the Irish singer Hozier is playing Chepstow Racecourse in Monmouthshire, Wales, on Tuesday (9 July), and general admission tickets are \u00a349, but for \u00a379 you get a \u201cpremium view\u201d at the front and access to \u201cposh flushable loos\u201d.",

    "body": "The S&P500 (SP500) closed in the green on Friday, after an eventful week that saw the arrival of fresh economic data supporting the easing of monetary policy.\n\nBesides focusing on the Fed\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting, market participants also digested comments from Fed chair Jerome Powell.\n\nFor the week, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (COMP:IND) gained 1.7%, while blue-chip Dow (DJI) advanced 0.4%.\n\nWall Street had a slew of upgrades and downgrades from analysts. Here are some of the major calls for the week:\n\nSpirit Airlines and Frontier\u2019s \u2018clear as mud\u2019 outlook setup concerns Raymond James\n\nRaymond James downgraded Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) and Frontier Group Holdings (NASDAQ:ULCC) to Underperform from Market Perform, with the brokerage saying that it sees the setup into Q3 outlook for both carriers \u201cclear as mud\u201d due to rapid market and product modifications, potential headwinds from softer consumer trends, Paris Olympics, and a \u201cpre-election corporate travel impact.\u201d\n\nRaymond James\u2019 Savanthi Syth says weak fare trend also possess a challenge, adding that she views legacy carriers Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) starting to experience some \u201cchop\u201d even as they are able to fly above much of the \u201cindustry turbulence.\u201d\n\nNvidia in focus on getting rare downgrade from New Street Research\n\nAI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was downgraded by to Neutral from Buy by New Street Research and set a 12-month price target of $135, citing limited further upside.\n\n\u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet,\u201d wrote New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu.\n\nHowever, the London-based investment firm added that the quality of the franchise is nevertheless intact, and it would be buyers again, but only on prolonged weakness.\n\nAtlassian\u2019s \u2018attractive entry point\u2019 impresses Piper; CrowdStrike \u2018less favorable\u2019 risk reward drives downgrade\n\nPiper Sandler upgraded Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) to Overweight from Neutral, saying that the current valuation of the project management software company creates a compelling entry point. The brokerage also hiked PT by $25 to $225.\n\n\u201cThe current valuation as an attractive entry point into what we view as one of the most durable companies in our coverage,\u201d said Piper analyst Rob Owens. Atlassian lost over 20% so far this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Owens downgraded CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) to Neutral from Overweight, citing high valuation and \u201cless favorable\u201d risk reward.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic about the company longer term as well as the opportunity, just not the stock over our 12-month investment horizon,\u201d wrote Owens.\n\nCiti not confident on summer housing activities\n\nCiti downgraded home builders Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) to Neutral from Buy on softening housing activity this summer. The brokerage also slashed LEN's PT from $174 to $164, while for DHI, it was cut to $156 from $18, saying it sees limited near-term catalysts for the stock until \u201925.\n\nNextEra Partners downgraded on dividend doubt\n\nNextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP) was downgraded to Sector Perform from Outperform with a $30 price target, cut from $38, anticipating a challenging road ahead with insufficient growth from wind repowering.\n\nRBC analyst Shelby Tucker believes NextEra will not be able to sustain long-term 5%-8% dividend/unit growth.\n\nSusquehanna positive on PayPal\u2019s profitable growth\n\nSusquehanna upgraded PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to Positive from Neutral, saying that it is positive on the payments company making profitable growth a top priority.\n\nThe brokerage considers the recent significant fall in the stock price for the ratings action. PayPal, which saw a significant dip after in value after Apple unveiled new products and features, has lost over 2% so far this year.\n\n\u201cConsumer-facing improvements should increase value proposition for branded checkout,\u201d pointed out Susquehanna analyst James Friedman and set PT of $71 on the stock.\n\nRaymond James bullish on Meta\u2019s GenAI monetization; Needham, however, has few concerns\n\nRaymond James reiterated its Strong Buy rating on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and raised the price target on the shares to $600 from $550, reflecting their bullish stance on GenAI monetization across Llama and consumer/business ad opportunities on the platform.\n\nHowever, the brokerage lowered its 2025 earnings estimate by 3% to $24.26 steered mainly by higher infrastructure costs.\n\nSeparately, Needham analysts are worried that Meta's growing investments in LLMs and in the Metaverse in the near term will lower its return on invested capital, or ROIC, and recommended investors use Meta as a source of funds.\n\nNeedham, which has an Underperform rating on the stock, added it is concerned that that expenses and capex estimates will increase faster than consensus estimates during 2024.\n\nOther than the companies mentioned above, some other notable analyst actions included Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) joining to Mizuho\u2019s monthly compilation of top picks, with analyst Gregg Moskowitz suggesting that the breadth of Adobe\u2019s AI monetization is \u201cbeing underappreciated\u201d by Wall Street, and it should become more apparent in H2 2024.\n\nWells Fargo added Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to its Q3 Tactical Ideas List and said the stock might see a near-term decline. Analyst Colin Langan maintained an Underweight rating on the EV firm and pointed towards the expectation for declining delivery growth driven by lower demand and diminished returns on price cuts.\n\nBMO Capital Markets downgraded drugmaker Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) to underperform from market perform, citing the potential consequences of the company\u2019s recently announced $2B share buybacks.",

Lilly's, in phase 3, is known as orforglipron.

Moldt said that consumer health product demand is rising due to an aging population and higher incomes.\n\n\"Companies specialising in consumer health areas will likely remain attractive acquisition targets in 2024 because recently spun-off pure-play over-the-counter drug and consumer health businesses are expected to use transactions to accelerate their own growth and transformation plans,\" he wrote.\n\nThat means the companies like Kenvue (KVUE) and Haleon (HLN) could be on the lookout for potential acquisitions.",

    "title": "Billionaire Bill Gates Has 68% of His Foundation's $46 Billion Portfolio Invested in 3 Phenomenal Stocks",
    "body": "Bill Gates is one of the best-known billionaires in the world.\n\nThe Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) founder became the first centibillionaire in 1999, decades before anyone else reached that level of wealth. He's still worth well over $100 billion today despite giving away billions to charitable causes and nonprofits over the past 25 years. Most of his donations go to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which aims to enhance healthcare and reduce poverty around the world.\n\nGates isn't the only centibiliionaire funding the nonprofit. Warren Buffett has also pledged donations to the foundation since 2006, but those contributions will end after his death. Buffett also served as a trustee until 2021.\n\nThe foundation's trust includes an equity portfolio valued at around $46 billion today, but over two-thirds of that amount, about 68%, is invested in just three stocks.\n\n1. Microsoft (37%)\n\nIt's probably not a huge surprise that Microsoft makes up a significant chunk of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. Bill Gates founded the company in 1975 and remains one of the largest individual shareholders despite donating and selling millions of shares worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nGates made a $20 billion donation in 2022, and a large portion of that donation appears to have been in the form of Microsoft stock. The trust's share count increased by over 38 million that year. It now has about 36.5 million shares worth nearly $16.8 billion, as of this writing.\n\nThe Gates Foundation has been able to hold on to most of those shares, and it's paid off handsomely. Microsoft shares are up more than 63% since the end of July 2022, driven by surging demand for artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft has become a leader in AI, thanks in part to its investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It added $10 billion to its investment in early 2023, which positioned it as a top choice for developers looking to use the public cloud to train and deploy AI-powered applications. AI-related services helped drive its Azure cloud platform revenue growth of 31% in its most recent quarter. That's faster growth than anyone else in the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft remains a dominant force in enterprise software with its Windows OS and Office productivity suite. It's adding enhanced AI features and seeing strong traction in sales.\n\nMicrosoft's shares trade for a high valuation of about 34 times forward earnings. But with a long runway for growth in cloud computing and AI, the cash cow of its enterprise software business, and its current cash position, it may be worth the high multiple.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Waste Management (16%)\n\nWaste Management (NYSE: WM) isn't the kind of company you think of when you think of when you think of a tech billionaire. But Gates is probably more influenced by Buffett than by Silicon Valley's tech elite. Waste Management is a textbook Buffett stock.\n\nThe business is easily understood, it's absolutely boring, and it provides stable and growing revenue. The company benefits from a wide economic moat derived from its landfill ownership and route density. That allows Waste Management to increase its pricing faster than inflation. The company also grows from acquisitions, such as the recent purchase of Stericycle.\n\nThe company's also found ways to reduce costs over the past decade. Its operating margin climbed from around 15% 10 years ago to 19.4% over the trailing 12 months.\n\nGates has held shares of Waste Management for the foundation trust for over a decade, doubling down on the position in 2022. The position has paid off well, as the stock's total return over the past decade has more than doubled the S&P 500.\n\nThe stock currently trades at an enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of about 17.25, which is comparable with its closest competitors. While it might be a bit expensive for a boring businesses, Waste Management's strong position in its stalwart industry might make the stock worth the price for someone looking for a stable utility.\n\n3. Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares (15%)\n\nAs mentioned, Buffett has been a longtime contributor to the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation. The way Buffett donates his wealth is by converting his Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares (NYSE: BRK.A) into Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares (NYSE: BRK.B). He then donates the Class B shares.\n\nThe maneuver allows Buffett to retain control of Berkshire Hathaway while giving away much of his wealth. He donates about 5% of his remaining shares to various nonprofits every year.\n\nThe trust's current position in Berkshire Hathaway is actually one of the lowest levels of concentration in the stock. Buffett's donation stipulates the foundation spend the entire value of his contribution each year plus 5% of its net assets. In effect, Buffett's making sure the foundation doesn't stockpile Berkshire stock. That's resulted in a steadily declining share count over the past few years, as Berkshire stock has increased in value.\n\nThere's good reason to expect Berkshire to outperform the S&P 500. First, its forward P/E of just 18.5 presents good value to the market. That's despite Buffett's assertion that the company's current mix of wholly and partially owned businesses present better earnings prospects than the average American corporation. That valuation is made even more attractive when you account for the $189 billion in cash and treasury bonds on Berkshire's balance sheet, the strong free cash flow of Berkshire's core operations, and Buffett's consistent share repurchases.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "3 Leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Can Plunge Up to 91%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
    "body": "For the past 30 years, Wall Street and the investment community have been waiting for a game-changing innovation or technology to come along that can rival or surpass what the internet did for corporate America. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) just might fit the bill.\n\nWhen discussing AI, I'm loosely talking about using software and systems to handle tasks that humans would normally be responsible for. What makes AI such a potential cornerstone innovation is the ability for software and systems to learn without human oversight. This ability to become more efficient at tasks over time, as well as learn new tasks, gives this technology utility in pretty much all facets of the U.S. and global economy.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nJust how big the AI revolution could be is left up to interpretation and the imagination. But according to the lofty estimates provided by analysts at PwC, artificial intelligence has the capacity to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. PwC came to this conclusion by deducing that $6.6 trillion would be added by increases in productivity, with the remaining $9.1 trillion aided by consumption-side benefits.\n\nDollar figures this large aren't lost on Wall Street's brightest minds. Most Wall Street institutions and analysts have set lofty growth expectations and sky-high price targets on market-leading AI stocks.\n\nBut there are exceptions.\n\nBased on the low-water price targets from select Wall Street analysts, the following three leading artificial intelligence stocks can plunge by up to 91%.\n\nPalantir Technologies: Implied downside of 65%\n\nThe first top-tier AI stock that might get taken to the woodshed, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR).\n\nWhereas one analyst believes Palantir still offers 35% upside from where it closed on July 3, Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital believes it's worth $9 per share. If this forecast proves accurate, one of the hottest AI stocks would plummet by 65%!\n\nAlthough longtime Palantir bear Jaluria recognizes that its operating results have been solid, a May 2024 note implies concern about the company's commercial segment. Specifically, Jaluria points to revenue that's been pulled forward from special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) that had signed deals with Palantir. There's no telling how sustainable or recurring this revenue will be.\n\nWhile Jaluria's concern is valid -- most SPACs have been disasters for investors -- Palantir does bring identifiable competitive advantages to the table that clearly do deserve some premium. For instance, the scope of services provided by Palantir can't be duplicated at scale by any other business.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir's bread-and-butter operating segment has long been Gotham. This is the AI-driven platform that helps governments gather data and plan missions, among other tasks. The company typically secures multiyear contracts from governments using Gotham, which leads to sustained double-digit sales growth and predictable cash flow.\n\nHowever, the company's future likely rests with the success of its Foundry platform, the aforementioned \"commercial\" segment. Foundry is tasked with helping businesses understand their data so they can streamline their operations. Commercial customer count has surged 53% over the last year (as of March 31, 2024), albeit this segment is still in its very early stages of growth.\n\nAlthough Palantir can deliver sustained double-digit sales growth and is irreplaceable at scale, a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 65 and a price-to-sales ratio of 25 (based on trailing-12-month sales), are tough pills to swallow in an already pricey stock market.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 22%\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that might face a coming beatdown is the company that's benefited most from the AI revolution: semiconductor titan Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nWhile most Wall Street analysts can't set their price targets high enough for this leading AI stock, Deutsche Bank's Ross Seymour set a $100 price target ($1,000 prior to Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split) in May. If Nvidia were to hit $100 per share, it would shed 22% of its current value, which translates to almost $700 billion in lost market cap.\n\nIn many ways, Nvidia's expansion has been flawless. The company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) has quickly become the must-have chip for AI-accelerated data centers. Last year, Nvidia's GPUs accounted for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped, according to TechInsights. With its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture set to make its debut in the latter half of this year, Nvidia shouldn't have any trouble maintaining its compute advantage in enterprise data centers.\n\nHowever, history has consistently been a thorn in the side of businesses leading next-big-thing revolutions. Since the advent of the internet, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that's avoided a bubble in its early innings. Investors habitually overestimate the uptake and growth potential of new innovations and technologies while giving them no time to mature. Artificial intelligence seems unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nNvidia's fiscal second-quarter adjusted gross margin forecast of 75.5% (+/- 50 basis points) may also be an ominous warning. While an adjusted gross margin of 75.5% is still well above its historic norm, it represents a decline of 235 to 335 basis points from the sequential quarter. Putting two and two together, it suggests that competitive pressures have entered the picture.\n\nExternal competitors are releasing or ramping up production of their respective AI-GPUs in the second half of the year, while Nvidia's top four customers by net sales are all developing AI-accelerating chips of their own for their data centers. The GPU scarcity responsible for fueling Nvidia's scorching-hot adjusted gross margin looks set to wane -- and that's potentially bad news for investors.\n\nTesla: Implied downside of 91%\n\nHowever, the potential disaster du jour among AI stocks is the world's most-valuable electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). The company's full self-driving (FSD) software, which uses a network of cameras and ultrasonic sensors to avoid obstacles, is a perfect example of how Tesla incorporates AI into its EVs.\n\nIn mid-April, longtime Tesla bear Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research lowered his uber-specific price target on Tesla to $22.86 per share. Historically, Johnson has arrived at his price targets by placing a multiple of 15 on his forward-year earnings estimate for the company and applying a 9% discount rate at the current price.\n\nThere's no denying that Tesla has done what had been impossible in the auto industry for more than a half-century. CEO Elon Musk successfully built the company from the ground up to mass production, and has delivered four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit. But the praise ends here.\n\nOver the last 18 months, Tesla has slashed the selling price for its fleet of EVs on more than a half-dozen occasions. With its first-mover advantages waning and competition picking up, Musk has had no choice but to become more price-competitive. The end result has been a steep reduction in the company's operating margin, a reversal to a free cash outflow during the first quarter, and a big increase in the company's EV inventory.\n\nFurthermore, Tesla's efforts to become more than a car company have largely fallen flat. Though it does have a handful of small victories under its belt, the growth rate for Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment has tapered significantly, while gross margin for Services is in the low single digits. As much as investors want to pretend that Tesla is an energy or tech company, the bulk of its sales and profits still come from its now-struggling and cyclical EV operations.\n\nThe other damning factor for Tesla is the laundry list of promises and innovations from Musk that have failed to take shape. After a full decade of promising Level 5 autonomy for his company's EVs, Tesla's FSD hasn't budged from Level 2 autonomy. What's more, the Cybertruck has been an early stage flop, with multiple recalls and subpar deliveries.\n\nTesla is an auto stock with contracting margins and declining EV deliveries that's trading at a premium to even the loftiest of AI stocks. While a 91% drop might be a bit extreme, I'd have to concur with Gordon Johnson that significant downside seems likely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "1 Stock I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole -- and Here's Why",
    "body": "With the stock market at record highs, you'd think that the vast majority of companies would be thriving. However, this just isn't the case, as there is a wide range of outcomes from businesses in all different industries.\n\nConsequently, some companies flat-out continue to struggle mightily with no end in sight, even though the economy has remained resilient. Here's one business that fits this category that I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole. And I don't think you should, either.\n\nStruggling with growth and profitability\n\nShares of Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON) currently trade 98% off their peak price, a milestone achieved in January 2021. While this was one of Wall Street's hottest stocks during the pandemic, it has since become one of the most disappointing. And this is due to ongoing challenges that don't appear to be getting resolved anytime soon.\n\nLet's start with demand. Peloton is having a hard time boosting its revenue. During the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), the business reported sales of $718 million, which was down 4% year over year. This marked the ninth straight three-month period that a drop was registered, clearly not an encouraging sign. And that figure was significantly lower than three years before in Q3 2021.\n\nIt's not a shock to anyone that after economies started to open back up and consumer behavior normalized, Peloton would experience a slump. In other words, demand was probably pulled forward. That's understandable, and it's something a lot of internet-enabled businesses saw at the time.\n\nBut what's truly alarming is that Peloton just hasn't recovered. Its connected-fitness subscriber base is plateauing, indicating how difficult it has been to sell more of the company's expensive exercise equipment. And this is despite launching a bike rental program in 2022, as well as entering into distribution agreements with e-commerce juggernaut Amazon and brick-and-mortar retailer Dick's Sporting Goods.\n\nAnd the business remains in terrible financial shape. While driving top-line growth is clearly a huge problem, Peloton's survivability is in question. It doesn't appear close to posting a profit anytime soon.\n\nThe net loss came in at $167 million in the latest fiscal quarter. The new management team has embarked on sizable cost cuts, which is the right move. However, it's anyone's guess when things will turn around.\n\nA high-risk situation\n\nA reasonable investor might still consider buying shares in this troubled enterprise. Peloton's market cap of $1.2 billion is less than half its trailing-12-month revenue of $2.7 billion. These shares have gotten so beaten down that it's impossible to find any ounce of optimism as we look toward the future. Deep-value investors, particularly those with a certain level of comfort with high-risk situations, might take a chance on Peloton.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'm not one of those people. I don't have the skill set to accurately predict when, or if, Peloton will get on the right track. And I'll gladly pass on the stock.\n\nWhat I've learned by observing Peloton over the past few years is that it's best to focus on identifying businesses that consumers can't live without. What would happen if Peloton simply didn't exist anymore? Sure, some of the company's most loyal customers would be upset. But there are an unlimited number of ways to work out that the void would be easily filled.\n\nOn the other hand, think about Alphabet or Visa, for example. They are so vital to our day-to-day lives that we can't imagine our world without them. Peloton doesn't belong in this elite group. And that's another reason I won't touch the stock with a 10-foot pole.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Peloton Interactive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Peloton Interactive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Peloton Interactive wasn\u2019t one of them.

My grandfather passed away several weeks ago. The loan is now in default and I have no idea where my cousin is. I\u2019m appalled. What happens now?\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\nIf a co-signer on a loan dies, is the loan forgiven, or is the estate forced to pay?\n\nThe Cousin\n\nRelated: \u2018He thinks I\u2019m too materialistic\u2019: My husband and I are in our 40s. He takes zero interest in our finances. He doesn\u2019t even know the name of our mortgage company. What can I do?\n\nResearch shows that a quarter of co-signers end up making at least one payment. - MarketWatch illustration\n\nDear Cousin,\n\nI\u2019m sorry your grandfather passed away, and I only hope that he had no knowledge of his grandson\u2019s behavior before he died. I have good news for your grandfather\u2019s estate \u2014 and his heirs \u2014 and bad news for the grandson who skipped town.\n\nUpon the death of a MEFA loan nonstudent co-borrower, the deceased and their estate are no longer liable for the loan, according to a spokesperson for MEFA. The estate should notify MEFA\u2019s loan-servicing company, AES, at 800-233-0557 in order to provide proper documentation.\n\n\u201cUpon the passing of a co-borrower, a student borrower does remain responsible for the loan,\u201d the spokesperson says. \u201cPer MEFA\u2019s policy, a loan that is 180 days past due is deemed to be defaulted and may be referred to our default collections firm.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the loan won\u2019t go away just because your cousin skipped town. \u201cWe urge any MEFA loan borrower who is behind on loan payments to reach out to us so that we can help them manage their loan obligations,\u201d the MEFA spokesperson says.\n\nThere\u2019s one important takeaway for a co-signer of a student loan: Make sure the loan is not for more than you can afford to repay. Research shows that a quarter of co-signers end up making at least one payment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the borrower misses payments \u2014 even if they later catch up \u2014 the missed payments could hurt the co-signer\u2019s credit score, which could then push up the cost of car and personal loans and mortgages for that borrower, or even result in a loan application being declined.\n\nEven co-signing for a loan can impact a person\u2019s credit score. A FICO FICO credit score is calculated using a variety of credit data, including payment history (35%), the amount the person owes (30%), the length of their credit history (15%), new credit (10%) and their credit mix (10%).\n\nRequesting a lower monthly payment\n\nYour cousin could request a lower monthly payment on his student loan. Most reputable loan companies will want to work with borrowers to get them back into the black. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says rehabilitation programs are offered by some lenders.\n\n\u201cBe sure your lender tells the primary borrower all the requirements of the program, such as additional costs, and whether the default note can be removed or updated on your credit reports,\u201d the CFPB says.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s easy to see your cousin as a ne\u2019er-do-well who took advantage of your grandfather, but the truth is probably more complicated than that. He likely got in over his head, got scared and ran instead of facing up to his responsibilities.\n\nOver the past 30 years, adjusted for inflation, annual tuition costs grew from $4,160 to $10,740 at public four-year colleges in the U.S., and from $19,360 to $38,070 at private nonprofit institutions, Forbes reported in April.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to feel sympathy for your cousin and the many others like him. Student-loan debt is a huge burden for millions of Americans. The total amount of student debt currently stands at $1.75 trillion, with federal student loans accounting for more than 90% of that figure, Forbes added.\n\nIf your cousin is looking for a job, he should know that approximately 95% of companies carry out background checks on job candidates and, according to this survey by HR.com and the National Association of Professional Background Screeners, 16% pull credit or financial checks.\n\nSo what now? If your cousin gets in touch with you, tell him that you are here to help \u2014 not as a co-signer, but as support to help him go through his finances and work out a payment plan. The real monster in this situation is the unpaid debt, not your cousin.\n\nOther columns from Quentin Fottrell:\n\n\u2018Our children have varying degrees of success\u2019: My husband and I are in our 80s and have $300,000 to leave our 3 kids. Do we give more to our underemployed son?\n\n\u2018My stepmother makes me feel unwelcome\u2019: I bought a house for my father in 2008, but now he wants me to sign over a 50% share for his third wife\n\n\u2018She told my grandchildren lies about me so they would despise me\u2019: I\u2019m disinheriting my ungrateful and selfish daughter.

    "title": "How a New York short-seller took on one of the world's richest people, wiped out $150 billion in market value, and barely made any money",
    "body": "An art school teacher puts final touches on a painting of Indian businessman Gautam Adani highlighting the ongoing crisis of the Adani group in Mumbai on February 3, 2023. Indranil Mukherjee/Getty Images\n\nActivist short-seller Hindenburg Research wiped out $153 billion in market value from Adani Group.\n\nIt recently disclosed that it made just $4 million for its efforts.\n\nDetailed below is the war of words that's taken place over the past 18 months.\n\nNate Anderson, the chief mind behind activist short-seller Hindenburg Research, has had an eventful past 18 months.\n\nIn January 2023, he accused the Indian conglomerate owned by Gautam Adani \u2014 one of the world's richest people \u2014 of fraud, subsequently wiping out $153 billion in market value from its associated companies. This led Indian regulators to his doorstep and forced him into defensive mode. A war of words has persisted ever since.\n\nA year and a half later, the battle continues. And based on new information released by Hindenburg, one might wonder whether it was all worth it.\n\nThe firm \u2014 which describes itself as specializing in \"forensic financial research\" \u2014 recently disclosed that it's made just $4 million from its considerable efforts. Compared to the nine figures of market value it helped erase, and the $80 billion wiped from Adani's personal fortune, that's a drop in the bucket.\n\nDetailed below is the considerable back-and-forth that's taken place since Hindenburg's initial shot across the bow of Adani Group. The tale that follows highlights the lengths a global conglomerate \u2014 and the regulatory body with a vested interest in keeping it afloat \u2014 will go to defend itself. It also shows the resolute nature of Anderson as he continues fighting back.\n\nThe initial report\n\nHindenburg accused Indian business magnate Gautam Adani in 2023 of pulling off the \"largest con in corporate history.\" It was the result of a two-year-long investigation, which found a number of financial and accounting irregularities in Adani's empire, the firm said in its 106-page report.\n\n\"Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades,\" the report said. \"We believe the Adani Group has been able to operate a large, flagrant fraud in broad daylight in large part because investors, journalists, citizens and even politicians have been afraid to speak out for fear of reprisal,\" it later added.\n\nHindenburg identified at least 38 shell companies closely related to Adani Group, which it said appeared to engage in stock manipulation and money laundering. It cited \"numerous examples\"of those companies funneling money through private companies owned by Adani, before cash was set to Adani's listed public companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe short-seller's investigation also found Adani's private and public companies to have \"numerous\" undisclosed transactions with other parties, the researchers found, which violates regulatory laws in India.\n\nThe \"labyrinthian network of shells appears to serve several functions, including shuffling losses into private entities to boost reported earnings, and surreptitiously moving money to prop up entities in the group,\" Hindenburg said.\n\nAdani Group was also affiliated with a number of funds that displayed \"flagrant irregularities,\" the research firm said, such as being offshore entities, having concealed ownership information, and having portfolios being \"almost exclusively\" invested in Adani's firms.\n\nOne such fund, Elara, controlled another fund that was around 99% concentrated in Adani shares. That suggested to the researchers it was \"obvious Adani controls the shares,\" the report said.\n\nHindenburg attached a list of 88 questions for Adani to answer, which included inquiries into the billionaire's close contacts, Adani Group executives, and investigations into the company by regulators.\n\n\"If Gautam Adani embraces transparency, as he claims, they should be easy questions to answer,\" the report said.\n\nThe response\n\nNursing deep stock losses, Adani Group hit back with its own 413-page response, calling Hindenburg's original report \"nothing but a lie.\"\n\n\"We are shocked and deeply disturbed to read the report published by the 'Madoffs of Manhattan,'\" the reply said, referring to Hindenburg.\n\n\"The document is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and concealed facts relating to baseless and discredited allegations to drive an ulterior motive,\" it added.\n\nThe firm disclosed information on its accounting practices and professional relationships, while disputing many of the claims in the Hindenburg report.\n\nTransactions that were identified as suspicious by Hindenburg's team were in compliance with local laws and accounting standards, it said. Offshore companies and funds mentioned in Hindenburg's report were merely public shareholders in Adani-listed companies, the retort added.\n\n\"A listed entity does not have control over who buys/sells/owns the publicly traded shares or how much volume is traded, or the source of funds for such public shareholders nor it is required to have such information for its public shareholders under the laws of India. Hence we cannot comment on trading pattern or behavior of public shareholders,\" Adani's report said.\n\nThe firm also criticized Hindenburg for its financial stake in releasing the report, calling the firm an \"unethical short seller\" and guilty of a \"flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws.\"\n\n\"This is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securities to enable Hindenburg, an admitted short seller, to book massive financial gain through wrongful means at the cost of countless investors,\" it said.\n\nHindenburg issued a reply to Adani on the same day, denying any wrongdoing from its original report. They argued that Adani Group's reply failed to answer most of their questions. The conglomerate also didn't dispute the existence of certain \"suspect\" transactions, nor did it explain \"their obvious irregularities,\" researchers added.\n\n\"We also believe that fraud is fraud, even when it's perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world,\" Hindenburg Research said in its reply.\n\nAdani Group eventually lawyered up and readied for a fight, though the damage had already been done. In less than a week, Adani, known as the world's third richest man, saw his personal wealth plummet by $52 billion.\n\nConflict over Hindenburg's short-selling arrangement\n\nIndian regulators have raised specific questions about the structure of Hindenburg's short bet on Adani Group. The Securities and Exchange Board of India \u2014 the country's version of the SEC \u2014 sent a notice to Hindenberg in June 2024, raising questions about the nature of the report and the firm's relationship with Kingdon Capital Management, a New York hedge-fund involved in building a short position against Adani Group.\n\nHindenburg's initial report was described to be \"misleading\" and have contained \"inaccurate statements.\"\n\n\"These misrepresentations built a convenient narrative through selective disclosures, reckless statements, and catchy headlines, in order to mislead readers of the report and cause panic in Adani Group stocks, thereby deflating prices to the maximum extent possible and profit from the same,\" the notice read.\n\nRegulators also revealed that Hindenburg had shared its research with Kingdon prior to publication. The two companies had a profit-sharing agreement, the notice says, with Hindenburg set to get 25% of Kingdon's profits for the short bet.\n\nKingdon ended up making $22.3 million on the bet, $5.5 million of which is owed Hindenburg. $4.1 million of that had been paid as of the start of June, the document shows.\n\nHindenburg shrugged off the letter as \"nonsense,\" and an attempt to ward off whistleblowers who expose corruption among the country's most powerful people and companies.\n\n\"One might think that a securities regulator would be interested in meaningfully pursuing the parties that ran a secret offshore shell empire engaging in billions of dollars of undisclosed related party transactions through public companies while propping up its stocks through undisclosed share ownership via a network of sham investment entities,\" Hindenburg said in its reply.\n\nIt added: \"Instead, SEBI seems more interested in pursuing those who expose such practices.\"\n\nA passion for 'finding scams'\n\nBacklash is nothing new to Anderson, who's targeted other high-profile financiers and began sniffing out wrongdoers on Wall Street long before he launched Hindenburg Research in 2017.\n\nThis decade alone he's been instrumental in weeding out companies in the electric-vehicle industry. His work on Nikola led to fraud charges against its founder, and he also called out now-defunct Lordstown Motors for hyping up commercial interest in its product.\n\nMore recently he took aim at activist investor Carl Icahn and his famed operation, Icahn Enterprises.\n\n\"Find[ing] scams\" has been a life-long passion, he told the New York Times in a 2021 interview, adding that he had spent hours off-the-clock looking into potential schemes, to the chagrin of some of his former bosses.\n\n\"I didn't plan it this way,\" he told the Times. \"It was a side hobby that my employers were sometimes annoyed by.\"\n\nFraud-finding is one of his top goals of 2024, he wrote in a post on X in January.\n\n\"My 2023 New Years professional resolution is to work with our @HindenburgRes team to expose some of the biggest frauds and financial charlatans in the world,\" Anderson wrote. \"I am very confident we will achieve this goal.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

    "body": "The bull run in stocks may have further room for a stampede.\n\n\"We are in the early innings of a bull market where the earnings recovery story has barely begun,\" Bradesco BBI's head of equity strategy Ben Laidler told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here).\n\nLaidler, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes stints at HSBC and JPMorgan, thinks there's a likelihood of two interest rate cuts this year from the Fed \u2014 which should fuel further investor excitement beyond expected strong earnings growth.\n\nThose factors could help lift stocks at least 100% over five years, Laidler contended.\n\n\"Earnings might easily compound at 15% a year if the economy keeps chugging along and you get a little bit of multiple expansion, which I think lower interest rates would justify,\u201d he said.\n\nThe current bull market for stocks is seen as starting in October 2022, when the S&P 500 (^GSPC) reached its most recent low. Since then, the index has gained a sizzling 55%. The index has gained nearly 17% so far this year, reaching its latest record on Friday.\n\nThe gains have been powered by enthusiasm around AI, which has driven names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) to record highs.\n\nThis year, the momentum has carried the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) beyond 40,000 and the S&P 500 beyond 5,000.\n\nThe S&P 500 is in the midst of the 16th strongest start to a year since 1950, according to data from Truist chief markets strategist Keith Lerner. The S&P 500 has now risen in seven of the past eight months.\n\nPart of Laidler's thesis will be put to the test this coming earnings season, which begins with results from banks such as JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).\n\nFactSet pegs second quarter earnings growth for S&P 500 companies at 8.8%. If achieved, it will mark the highest year-over-year growth rate since the first quarter of 2022. It will also represent the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth for the index.\n\nDouble-digit-percentage earnings growth is expected in the Communications Services (18.5%) and Information Technology (16.1%) sectors.\n\n\u201cWe are in a very fundamentally supported market. Earnings are recovering, and rate cuts are coming,\u201d added Laidler.\n\nThe outlook for AI stocks still looks strong despite big-time gains, Goldman Sachs portfolio manager Brook Dane said on Opening Bid.

    "body": "A Southern California mom tells MarketWatch she and her husband were amused at the length of their Trader Joe\u2019s receipt but were OK with the cost of the groceries purchased. - Getty Images\n\nWhile inflation has cooled since its 2022 peak, food prices are still considerably higher than they were a few years ago, and one set of California parents showed the world just how expensive grocery shopping has been of late.\n\nGalen Callahan, 39, and her husband recently spent $444.38 on a single visit to Trader Joe\u2019s. They posted a video showing the receipt and noting, \u201cHere\u2019s what it takes to feed six kids [for] about a week and a half.\u201d It\u2019s been viewed more than 17 million times.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\nBut Callahan, who works at a title-services company with her husband, told MarketWatch that the post was not meant to slam, Trader Joe\u2019s pricing. Its prices are some of the most competitive in her area, she said.\n\n\u201cTrader Joe\u2019s is a super cheap option where we live,\u201d the Los Angeles\u2013area resident told MarketWatch. \u201cIt\u2019s funny to get a grocery receipt that\u2019s the length of the CVS receipt that everybody jokes about. It\u2019s just the amount of items that we thought was so funny.\u201d\n\nCallahan mentioned that she does a lot of mental math when grocery shopping, and thinks about her family\u2019s food budget on a per-meal basis.\n\n\u201cA $444 grocery bill that lasts us about 10 days \u2014 that\u2019s three meals a day for eight people, that\u2019s $1.85 per meal per person,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere are you going to eat for $1.85?\u201d\n\nLike many parents, Callahan stressed the importance of shopping around at grocery stores because it\u2019s typical for one store to have better prices for fruit, another to have better prices for meat, others to be better for bulk shopping.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do Vons, we\u2019ll also do Costco COST maybe once a month,\u201d she said. \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s has really inexpensive kids\u2019 snacks, their organic fruit is way cheaper, too.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Trader Joe\u2019s did not respond to MarketWatch\u2019s request for comment.\n\nSee: Home buyers who could barely afford their homes are a hit with TikTok viewers\n\nU.S. consumers are spending roughly 26% more on food than they did prior to the pandemic in 2020, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Food costs have outpaced overall consumer-price growth, at an aggregate 19%, over that period.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere are a few examples of food items that have increased in price in recent years:\n\nSee also: How much Arizona\u2019s 99-cent Iced Tea would cost if it kept up with inflation\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s is one of the least expensive grocery stores in the United States, but it\u2019s not the least expensive, according to one recent customer survey. Of course prices at grocery stores vary based on location, and high-cost-of-living areas tend to have higher food prices.\n\nConsumer-experience consultancy MarketForce Information took responses from 6,555 people about a variety of grocery-store topics, including which stores offered the best value for your money.\n\nSome grocery stores are more prevalent in certain areas of the country. For example, H-E-B has many locations in Texas, Food Lion tends to be located in southeastern states and Woodman\u2019s Markets are mainly located in the Midwest.\n\nRespondents said Aldi \u2014 with which Trader Joe\u2019s shares a corporate lineage \u2014 offered the best value for their money, followed by Woodman\u2019s Markets, WinCo Foods, Lidl and Market Basket.\n\nGrocery stores that customers say offer the best value for money. - Marketforce Information\n\nRead on: \u2018Our loyalty isn\u2019t worth anything\u2019: I paid $70 for a seat with more legroom, but two women grabbed similar empty seats for free.

    "title": "3 Reliable Dividend Stocks With Yields Above 5% You Can Buy With $100 in July",
    "body": "The benchmark S&P 500 index keeps breaking new records thanks in large part to a handful of stocks at the top. Luckily for income-seeking investors, there are some highly reliable dividend stocks out there that haven't been swept up in the excitement.\n\nShares of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC), and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) are reasonably valued, with an average dividend yield of about 7% at recent prices. Moreover, there's a good chance that all three can meet their commitments and continue raising them for many years to come.\n\nPfizer\n\nAt recent prices, Pfizer offers a juicy 6% yield, supported by profit from sales of innovative new drugs. The company has raised its dividend payout for 15 consecutive years, and it looks capable of maintaining this streak for at least another decade.\n\nPfizer reinvested some of the enormous profit its COVID-19 products generated into new sources of revenue that can keep its needle moving in the right direction. For example, the $43 billion acquisition of Seagen in 2023 gave it access to four commercial-stage cancer drugs, including Padcev.\n\nLast December, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Padcev for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with advanced-stage bladder cancer. New patients tend to stay on therapy much longer than folks who have already relapsed, so this label expansion could add billions to Pfizer's top line in the years ahead.\n\nIn addition to Padcev's label expansion, the FDA also approved a record nine new drugs from Pfizer last year. With plenty of new revenue sources, another decade of steady dividend raises seems likely.\n\nAres Capital\n\nAres Capital is a business development company (BDC), which means it has to distribute nearly all its profits to investors as a dividend. This BDC's dividend hasn't risen in a straight line, but it is up by 26% over the past decade.\n\nAt recent prices, the stock offers an eye-popping 9.2% yield and a good chance to see significantly more when you're ready to retire.\n\nFor decades, big American banks have been increasingly hesitant about lending to all but the largest businesses. As a result, Ares Capital and its BDC peers can always find midsize companies willing to accept relatively high-interest loans.\n\nAres Capital collected loan payments from 510 different companies in the first quarter. With an investment portfolio worth $23.1 billion, it's the largest publicly traded BDC. That means it has heaps of relationships with mid-market businesses and their private equity sponsors.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith plenty of potential borrowers to choose from, Ares Capital's underwriting department can focus on those most likely to repay their debts. At the end of March, just 0.7% of investments were on non-accrual status.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is another large drugmaker, with a 15-year consecutive annual dividend-raising streak. At recent prices, the pharma stock offers a big 5.9% dividend yield and an excellent chance for further payout raises.\n\nShares of Bristol Myers Squibb are down largely because the company frightened investors with a drastically reduced earnings outlook for 2024. In February, management told investors it would earn between $7.10 and $7.40 per share this year. In April, the company slashed its 2024 earnings estimate to a range between $0.40 and $0.70 per share to account for $12.9 billion worth of in-process research and development expenses associated with recent acquisitions.\n\nIn the first quarter, Bristol Myers Squibb closed out acquisitions of Karuna Therapeutics, Mirati Therapeutics, and RayzeBio. Accounting for the acquisitions early is unusual, but it isn't a reason to avoid the stock.\n\nIn the first quarter, Bristol Myers Squibb's portfolio of more recently launched drugs grew sales by 11% if we ignore the negative effects of a stronger dollar. With potential contributions from recent acquisitions, there's a good chance this drugmaker will keep raising its payout for another 15 years. Adding some shares to an income-generating portfolio now looks like a smart move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Pfizer wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Here's What the Average Couple on Social Security Is Earning in 2024",
    "body": "Married couples typically have greater retirement expenses than single adults because they have to cover two people. That's twice as many groceries, twice the healthcare bills, and twice the goals you'll have to budget for.\n\nBut they also have an advantage when it comes to Social Security benefits. As long as at least one partner worked long enough to qualify, the couple will receive two monthly checks. Here's what that can add up to in annual income from the program.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat the average couple gets from Social Security right now\n\nThe average monthly retirement benefit as of May 2024 is $1,917 per month. If both spouses qualified for this amount, their household monthly benefits would be $3,834 per month, or about $46,000 per year. For most people, that'll go a long way toward covering their annual retirement expenses. They can supplement these benefits with personal savings or employment income.\n\nBut many couples don't get quite this much. If only one partner worked long enough to qualify for Social Security, the other cannot claim a retirement benefit of their own. However, they can claim a spousal benefit. This is up to one-half of the retirement benefit the worker qualifies for at their full retirement age. So if a couple received one average retirement benefit of $1,917 per month and one average spousal benefit of $911 per month, their total Social Security income would be $2,828 per month, or a little under $34,000 annually.\n\nBut even this is only a rough estimate. Most workers aren't going to qualify for the exact average benefit. And even those that do may get a different amount, depending on their age when they sign up.\n\nHow married couples can plan for Social Security in retirement\n\nUnderstanding how much you can expect from Social Security is key to budgeting effectively for retirement. It's often easiest to work this out by creating a my Social Security account.\n\nAfter verifying your identity, the account can tell you whether you've worked long enough to qualify for Social Security. If you have, there's a tool that estimates your monthly benefit at every possible claiming age. You can also tweak estimates of your future earnings if you want to see how a pay raise might affect your checks, for example.\n\nYou can apply for retirement benefits after turning 62, but if you want the full benefit you're entitled to, you must wait until your full retirement age (FRA). That's 66 to 67, depending on your birth year. Claiming early will shrink your benefit up to 30%, but you can also delay benefits beyond your FRA. Doing so will gradually increase your benefit (as much as 32%) until it maxes out at age 70.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpousal benefits are a bit trickier. Most people can also apply as early as 62 but only if your spouse is already claiming Social Security. If not, you must wait until they apply. Delaying Social Security will gradually increase your monthly benefit as well, but it maxes out when you reach FRA. So unlike retirement benefits, there are no additional gains to be had by delaying spousal benefits until age 70.\n\nThat said, if you qualify for both a retirement and spousal benefit, the Social Security Administration automatically gives you the larger of the two. If you're not sure which that will be, the my Social Security account again has tools that can help you estimate your benefits at all possible claiming ages.\n\nTalk with your spouse and figure out when each of you plans to apply for benefits. Once you know how much to expect in benefits, you can understand how much you'll need to save for retirement on your own.\n\nThe $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year!

    "title": "Costco Is Up 32% in 2024: Could the Stock-Split Candidate Hit $1,000 per Share by the End of the Year?",
    "body": "Large- and megacap stocks have performed well in 2024. Retail giant Costco (NASDAQ: COST) hasn't missed the party with the stock up 32% year to date. Its chain of membership warehouse clubs is gaining market share in the United States and putting up strong growth across its in-person and e-commerce operations, impressing investors.\n\nAt $863 per share as of this writing, it could be a future stock-split candidate. Will the stock reach $1,000 by year-end, and is it a buy at these prices? Let's investigate.\n\nStrong growth and an incoming price hike?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was a boon for retailers such as Costco. Revenue growth accelerated, pushing annual sales from $150 billion to $200 billion over just a few years. But unlike other retailers, Costco did not face a pandemic growth hangover. In fact, the company has continued to post strong growth and recently surpassed $250 billion in annualized sales.\n\nThe bottom line has followed suit with earnings per share (EPS) up close to 100% in the past five years. This strong growth has investors speculating a price hike is incoming for Costco's membership program. A membership currently costs $60 or $120, depending on the tier. There are well over 100 million members, and the company hasn't raised its membership price since 2017. Costco typically raises membership fees every five years or so, meaning the company is overdue for a price hike.\n\nWith high profit margins on the memberships themselves, a price hike could help Costco continue to grow its EPS over the next five years as well.\n\nForget $1,000 per share -- focus on valuation instead\n\nIt will require a 16% gain for Costco's share price to breach four-figure territory. Since the stock has already climbed by twice this amount in the first half of 2024, I don't doubt it's possible for Costco to surpass $1,000 before the end of the year.\n\nSuch a high stock price also makes Costco a stock-split candidate. Investors have recently seen Nvidia and Chipotle go through the process, and Costco's last stock split was in 2000.\n\nBut investors shouldn't focus on either of these things. Stock splits do not matter over the long term. A stock split just means there are more share of the same company available in the market. The actual stock price does not matter; what matters is valuation.\n\nAnd Costco's valuation has been climbing for years. It currently has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 53, close to an all-time high and well above its long-term average of 27.\n\nAt these levels, investors have very high expectations for Costco's future growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nCOST PE Ratio Chart\n\nAvoid Costco stock (for now)\n\nCostco is a great business. Even with $250 billion of trailing-12-month sales, the company was able to grow comparable sales 6.5% in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended May 12). E-commerce sales were up 20.7% year over year. Earnings should continue to rise too, thanks to its track record of slow-and-steady growth.\n\nBut that's the issue: slow and steady. Costco is not a hypergrowth stock, but it's valued like one with a P/E ratio of more than 53.\n\nForget the stock split. Forget the potential for shares to reach $1,000 in the near term. It doesn't matter how great a business is if you have to pay too steep a premium to buy it: Price matters.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Costco Wholesale wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Statistics Say This Is the Best Age to Claim Social Security",
    "body": "When's the best age to begin collecting Social Security retirement benefits? That's a question the Social Security Administration (SSA) is asked frequently. The agency's answer: \"There's not a single 'best age' for everyone and, ultimately, it's your choice.\"\n\nThis response is correct. However, if you want to maximize how much money you receive from Social Security, there is an optimal answer for most Americans. Statistics say there's one best age to claim Social Security.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nSocial Security's big trade-off\n\nThe earliest you can claim Social Security retirement benefits is age 62. Why shouldn't everyone begin collecting benefits as soon as possible? SSA imposes an early retirement penalty.\n\nFor every month you retire before your full retirement age (FRA) up to 36 months, your benefit will be reduced by five-ninths of 1%. If you retire more than 36 months before your FRA, your benefit will be reduced by five-twelfths of 1%. The full retirement age (FRA) for anyone born in 1960 or later is 67. This means that your retirement benefit for claiming at age 62 will be 30% lower than your benefit at age 67. Ouch.\n\nWhat's more, you can receive even higher benefits by holding off on collecting until you reach age 70. SSA offers a delayed retirement credit. For anyone born in 1943 and later, your retirement benefit will increase by two-thirds of 1%, or 8% per year. If you wait until age 70 to begin receiving retirement benefits, your benefits will be 24% higher than if you started receiving them at a full retirement age of 67.\n\nEvery American must consider Social Security's big trade-off in deciding when to claim retirement benefits. You can begin receiving your benefits sooner, but your monthly amount will be reduced. You can wait until later to receive a higher benefit, but you'll have to rely on other sources of income in the meantime.\n\nWhat a detailed study found\n\nQuite a few analyses have been conducted through the years about the optimal age for claiming Social Security retirement benefits. However, the most detailed and thorough one I've found was a study done by David Altig of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Laurence Kotlikoff and Victor Yifan Ye of Boston University. In November 2022, these three economists reported their findings in a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).\n\nThis study used a statistical tool called the Fiscal Analyzer, developed by Economic Security Planning, Inc. The Fiscal Analyzer incorporated lifespan uncertainty, cash-flow constraints, and all major federal and state tax and transfer programs (notably Medicare and Medicaid).\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat did this detailed study find? Nearly every American (over 99%) who hasn't begun collecting Social Security retirement benefits should wait beyond age 65 to do so. More than 90% should wait to claim Social Security until age 70.\n\nTo be sure, most people don't wait until age 70 to collect their retirement benefits. Altig, Kotlikoff, and Ye noted that only 10.2% hold off that long. But claiming benefits earlier than 70 leaves a lot of money on the table.\n\nWhy defy the statistics?\n\nThe best age, statistically, to claim Social Security retirement benefits is 70. So why even consider defying the statistics? Two reasons especially stand out.\n\nFirst, you're not a statistic. You know your healthcare status better than economists analyzing aggregate data. If you think you won't live past your mid-70s because of poor health, family history, etc., collecting retirement benefits earlier could be the right decision for you.\n\nSecond, money isn't everything. You could place a higher value on being able to travel and do other things you'd like to do by claiming retirement benefits earlier than you do on increasing your monthly benefit.\n\nThe best age to start receiving retirement benefits varies from one individual to another. And SSA was right: Only you get to decide when's the right time for you.\n\nThe $ 22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year!

    "title": "I Pay a 1% Fee for Having $1.7M Invested With My Advisor. Am I Paying Too Much?",
    "body": "A financial advisor meets with a client in his office.\n\nWhen it comes to financial advice, what you pay can vary based on what you get. An advisor who simply sets you up with a passive S&P 500 index fund might not be worth a 1% fee, while an advisor who helps you manage taxes and cash flow, plan for retirement and save for your child\u2019s college education is likely worth significantly more.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in working with a financial advisor but don\u2019t know where to start, try SmartAsset\u2019s free tool to connect with fiduciary advisors who serve your area.\n\nFor example, say you have $1.7 million invested with a financial advisor. A 1% fee is within the average range for the industry, but whether you\u2019re getting a good deal will depend entirely on your advisor\u2019s skill and services.\n\nWhat Are Advisor Fees?\n\nFinancial advisors have several different ways of structuring their fees. The most common types of fees are:\n\nHourly : A fixed rate that\u2019s charged for every hour worked.\n\nFixed : A predetermined amount that you pay for a specific service.\n\nPercentage of AUM : A variable rate based on a percent of the total assets under management (AUM), typically billed annually or quarterly.\n\nCommissions and performance fees: Commissions are fees your advisor receives for specific trades or transactions they make, while performance-based fees apply when they meet certain goals.\n\nToday, fees that are based on a percentage of a client\u2019s AUM are the most common type of advisory fee. A 2022 study by Kitces found that AUM fees were the majority revenue source for 82% of financial advisors surveyed. Here\u2019s how they work: say for example that an advisor charges 0.5% annually and they manage a $100,000 portfolio. At the end of the year, you would have paid $500 ($100,000 * 0.005) in management fees, which may have been taken directly from your account.\n\nFixed and hourly rates are more common for advisors who perform specific services. For example, if a financial advisor does your taxes or makes a plan for college savings, they may bill by the hour or charge you a flat rate for those services.\n\nBut if you need help finding a financial advisor, consider matching with one using this free tool.\n\nWhat Do You Get For Your Fees?\n\nA financial advisor meets with a client in her office.\n\nFinancial advisors can provide a range of services.\n\nFlat- and hourly-fee structures are generally built around specific deliverables. For example, some advisors will help you to create a tax strategy, a household budget or an overall financial plan. It\u2019s also common for a financial advisor to offer a comprehensive range of financial services based on what you need to achieve.\n\nAUM-based fees are typically associated with ongoing portfolio management. Advisors who manage client portfolios typically select investments, moving money according to a pre-determined strategy. Percentage-based fees seek to align your advisor\u2019s incentives with your own. The more they grow your money, the more assets they will have under management and, in turn, the larger their fee can potentially be.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, higher fees do not always translate to better results. As a prospective client, you should carefully review what you receive for your money. If you want comprehensive financial services, how much does the advisor charge for each deliverable? If you want money management, how have their portfolios performed year-over-year? Make sure you\u2019re getting value for your money because even small percentage fees can add up.\n\nWhether you need ongoing portfolio management or standalone financial planning, evaluate those needs and then connect with a fiduciary financial advisor who offers those services.\n\nWhat Should You Pay?\n\nA financial advisor goes over his fee structure with two prospective clients.\n\nThe typical percentage-based fee that\u2019s often cited is 1% of AUM, although an AdvisoryHQ analysis found that average fees for portfolio management range from 0.59% to 1.18% of AUM. The exact rate you\u2019ll pay can depend on several factors, including the services bundled within that fee. For example, a financial advisor might charge more if the AUM fee also includes tax preparation and financial planning, while they might charge less if the fee only accounts for portfolio management.\n\nRobo-advisors, digital platforms that manage your portfolio automatically using an algorithm, tend to be significantly cheaper. These services generally charge between 0% to 0.89% percent of assets under management, according to Robo Adviser Pros. However, they also offer fewer services. A robo-advisor will manage your portfolio around specific metrics, but generally can\u2019t offer customized advice or services like financial planning and tax advice.\n\nFor a wealthy household, it\u2019s also important to consider asset-based discounts. Many financial advisors use graduated fee schedules with lower rates that apply to larger sums of money. For example, an advisor may charge a 1.5% fee on the first $250,000 in a portfolio and a 1% fee on the next $250,000. That advisor could charge just 0.75% to manage the next $500,000, meaning a $1 million portfolio woul qualify for a discount based on its sheer size.\n\nIf you have $1.7 million and are paying 1% in advisor fees, ultimately it\u2019s important to ask what you\u2019re getting for your money. This fee adds up to $17,000 per year, which may be reasonable given the level of service you receive and your satisfaction with the advisor.\n\nIf you currently have an advisor but want to find a new person to work with, this free tool can help you connect with a fiduciary advisor who serves your area.\n\nBottom Line\n\nOn average, financial advisors charge between 0.59% and 1.18% of assets under management for their asset management. At 1%, an advisor\u2019s fee is well within the industry average. Whether that fee is too much or just right depends entirely on what you think of the advisor\u2019s services and performance.\n\nTips for Picking an Advisor\n\nIs it worth paying a financial advisor 1%? This small percentage really can add up to a lot of money over time, so make sure to review what you\u2019re getting from that relationship in exchange for these fees.\n\nFinding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/shapecharge, \u00a9iStock.com/filadendron, \u00a9iStock.com/scyther5\n\nThe post I Have $1.7M Invested With My Advisor and I Pay a 1% Fee.

    "title": "3 High-Yield Energy Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in July",
    "body": "Finding high-yield stocks when the S&P 500 index is yielding a scant 1.3% may sound like a daunting task, but it isn't. You just need to be more discerning than usual when looking at massive yields, which often come with massive risks. Here are three high yields that are both attractively high and not laden with risk.\n\n1. Enterprise Products Partners is a rock in stormy seas\n\nThere's no way around it. Oil and natural gas are highly volatile commodities. But just because a company operates in the oil and gas industry doesn't mean it is risky.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), and its hefty 7% distribution yield, is a perfect example. This master limited partnership (MLP) owns the vital energy infrastructure that helps move oil and natural gas around the world. It charges fees for the use of its assets, so demand for energy is more important than energy prices. Energy demand tends to be high regardless of where oil prices are.\n\nThat's the backstory behind Enterprise's streak of 25 consecutive annual distribution increases. It also has an investment-grade-rated balance sheet. And its distributable cash flow covers its distribution by 1.7 times, which means there's a lot of leeway for adversity before the distribution would be at risk.\n\nEnterprise isn't perfect; the yield is going to make up the lion's share of an investor's return. But slow and steady growth, coupled with that ultra-high yield, will likely be a highly rewarding outcome for those looking to maximize the income their portfolios generate.\n\n2. WEC Energy's regulated assets are changing shape\n\nWEC Energy (NYSE: WEC) is a regulated utility that provides electricity and natural gas to 4.7 million customers in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota. The stock sports a 4.2% dividend yield backed by over two decades' worth of annual dividend increases. The payout has grown at an attractive 7% rate over the past decade which, the company happily explains, puts it in the top decile of the industry.\n\nWEC Energy's balance sheet carries an investment-grade credit rating, so it is financially strong. While that's important on the dividend front, more notable here is the growth potential of the business.\n\nThe utility is currently working on its largest capital investment plan ever, with an expectation to spend $23.7 billion over the next five years. That should help lead to earnings growth of between 6.5% and 7%, with the dividend likely to trail along with that growth. And one of the biggest drivers of the company's capital spending is its long-term shift away from coal toward cleaner energy sources, which is right in line with the broader trends in the utility industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, WEC Energy's yield is near its highest levels in a decade, suggesting it is on sale. If you are looking for a boring high-yield stock that can provide you with an attractive mix of yield and dividend growth, WEC Energy is one you need to be looking at right now.\n\n3. TotalEnergies mixes oil and renewables better than peers\n\nBut what if you actually want some direct exposure to oil and natural gas? That's where TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE) and its 5% dividend yield come in. TotalEnergies is an integrated energy major and has one of the highest yields among its closest peers.\n\nBut what really sets the company apart is its aggressive push to diversify into cleaner energy options, like solar and wind power. At the same time it is upping its game in natural gas, a transition fuel, and fine-tuning its exposure to oil, focusing only on its best assets. All in, it is deftly using its historical business to take it well into the future.\n\nAnd it is doing it better than any of its closest competitors. ExxonMobil and Chevron are really doubling down on oil and gas. BP and Shell both made splashy announcements about going green, but paired that directional shift with dividend cuts.\n\nAnd neither of those two European peers have really pushed as hard as TotalEnergies, which didn't resort to a dividend cut. In fact, TotalEnergies' dividend easily survived the deep energy downturn that accompanied the economic shutdowns in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTotalEnergies' performance is going to be tied to the price of oil and natural gas. But if you are looking for that kind of exposure, with a bit of a clean-energy hedge, this could be the integrated energy giant for you.\n\nMake sure you understand the story\n\nThere are companies that have huge yields because their businesses are in trouble. Then there are companies that are misunderstood for some reason, which offer attractive yields backed by strong businesses. That's what you'll get with Enterprise, WEC Energy, and TotalEnergies. Don't delay -- all three look attractive as July gets underway.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Enterprise Products Partners wasn\u2019t one of them.

The leading U.S. utility has generated an 11.4% annualized total return over the last 15 years. That has outpaced other utilities (6.8% annualized total return) and the S&P 500 (10.5%).\n\nPowering its returns has been its steadily rising earnings and dividend. Its adjusted earnings per share have increased at a 9% compound annual rate over the last decade, while its dividend has grown at a 10% compound annual rate. NextEra has benefited from the steady growth in power demand from utility customers in Florida, its investments in renewable energy, and accretive acquisitions.\n\nThose catalysts should continue powering above-average growth. NextEra expects to increase its adjusted earnings per share at or near the upper end of its 6% to 8% annual target range through at least 2027. Meanwhile, it expects to grow its dividend (which yields almost 3%) at a 10% annual rate through 2026.\n\nIts longer-term outlook is just as bright, given the immense need for renewable energy in the future. It expects new renewables and storage capacity additions to be three times more over the next seven years, compared to the past seven years.\n\nHigh-powered growth potential\n\nBrookfield Renewable has grown briskly over the years. The leading global renewable energy company delivered 12% compound annual growth in its funds from operations (FFO) per share since 2016. Meanwhile, it has increased its dividend at a 6% compound annual rate over the last two decades.\n\nThe company should continue generating high-powered earnings and income growth. Brookfield Renewable expects a trio of organic drivers (inflation-indexed rate increases, margin enhancement activities, and its vast development pipeline) to power 7% to 12% annual FFO per share growth through 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, it expects accretive acquisitions to drive its FFO growth rate into the double digits. The company recently agreed to acquire a European renewable energy developer with a large pipeline of projects in various stages of development. These growth drivers will give Brookfield plenty of power to achieve its aim of increasing its dividend (which yields around 5%) by 5% to 9% each year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother factor powering its view is its growing portfolio of sustainable solutions. Brookfield has built platforms in the carbon capture and storage, biofuel production, recycling, nuclear services, and solar panel manufacturing segments. These investments add to its long-term growth potential.\n\nHigh-end dividend growth ahead\n\nClearway Energy is one of the country's largest producers of renewable energy. It also has a portfolio of cleaner-burning natural gas power-generating facilities. These assets produce lots of stable cash flow, which Clearway pays out via a high-yielding dividend (recently approaching 6%).\n\nThe company expects to increase its payout toward the high end of its 5% to 8% annual target range through 2026. It has already secured and funded nearly all that growth. Clearway sold its thermal assets a few years ago and has been recycling the proceeds into higher-returning renewable energy investments. The company has committed to deploy or has line-of-sight on enough new investments to deliver on its dividend growth target.\n\nMeanwhile, Clearway has growing visibility into its ability to increase its dividend beyond 2026. It has been renewing contracts on its natural gas power plants at high-enough rates to support low-end dividend growth in 2027. In addition, it sees several opportunities to add battery storage to its existing wind and solar projects. On top of that, it has a strategic relationship with a leading renewable energy developer, which should continue providing it with new investment opportunities.\n\nPlugged into a powerful growth megatrend\n\nRenewable energy demand should continue growing briskly in the coming decades. That should enable NextEra Energy, Brookfield Renewable, and Clearway Energy to increase their earnings and dividends at healthy rates.\n\nThose growth drivers position these top energy stocks to generate strong total returns for investors over the long term. That makes them great stocks to buy and hold for long-term potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and NextEra Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?",
    "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has done a lot over the past five years. Five years ago, it was nearing the bottom of a cycle thanks to a collapse in the cryptocurrency market. Now, it's reaching new highs as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for creating artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nWhile it would have been nearly impossible to predict all of the places Nvidia has gone over the past five years, I'm going to speculate on where it could go in the next five years. Although this prediction will likely be wrong in some ways, it's good at least to develop an investment thesis for the market's most dominant company right now.\n\nNvidia's best-in-class GPUs are about to face some competition\n\nNvidia's GPUs are -- hands down - the best in class. There's a reason why all of the biggest companies that provide the tools to make AI models or create them in-house are using Nvidia GPUs nearly exclusively. However, that exclusivity may be dwindling.\n\nBecause GPUs can do multiple calculations in parallel, they are fantastic for creating AI models. However, if the only thing that the GPU will be doing is training AI models, more efficient hardware is available. For instance, Google Cloud's tensor processing unit (TPU) is more effective at training AI models than a GPU if the workload is set up to be run on a TPU.\n\nThis still leaves a use case for GPUs, which are fantastic for running initial models. However, custom-designed AI chips like TPUs can exceed the performance of GPUs when they are used for a specific purpose.\n\nGoogle Cloud isn't the only one creating these custom chips. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Meta Platforms are also creating their own custom-designed chips. This could present a problem for Nvidia over the next five years, as many of its largest customers are bringing these designs in-house. Demand for Nvidia GPUs will still likely be high, but it may not be as high as it is now.\n\nOn the plus side for Nvidia, all of the record-setting number of GPUs it has sold over the past year will eventually need to be replaced. While there is no hard and fast rule, it's common for these GPUs to last between three and five years in a data center. After that, they'll either need to be replaced (whether by some in-house design or Nvidia's latest product) or decommissioned.\n\nThe computing power to run these models continuously isn't going away, so decommissioning these GPUs isn't an option. This will create essentially a long-term subscription effect, and five years from now, Nvidia will likely see another wave of replacing the products it is selling right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's not to mention all of the technological improvements that will likely be made from now until then, as new chip technology (like Taiwan Semiconductor's 2-nanometer chip technology that will be more efficient than the previous generation) will create more powerful and efficient GPUs that will help its users out over the long run.\n\nBut is all of that already baked into the stock price?\n\nNvidia's profit margins are ripe for competition\n\nIt's no secret that Nvidia's stock is expensive. The shares trade at 73 times trailing and 46 times forward earnings, which means significant growth is already priced into the stock.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's record margins are not often discussed. Nvidia's near-60% profit-margin levels are unbelievable and are a primary reason why many companies are starting to design their chips in-house.\n\nNVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nBecause demand for Nvidia's GPUs is so high right now, the company can afford to charge a premium for its products. Eventually, that won't be the case, and its profit margins will likely fall over the next five years.\n\nWhen that happens, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio will increase due to earnings either growing at a slower pace or falling. This is a huge risk associated with the stock, as the market believes Nvidia's revenue will keep going straight up forever.\n\nWhile demand for Nvidia's products will likely remain elevated, don't be surprised when Nvida faces challenges with in-house solutions in the next few years. There's an old saying that a company's margins are a competitor's opportunity, and when Nvidia's margins reach these levels, there's bound to be competition soon.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's stock may face some pressure over the next five years. This unbelievable demand boom won't last forever, and the opportunity is just too large for every company to sit still and watch Nvidia take their money.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

    "body": "With a 90% market share, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) reigns as the undisputed King of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) chip market. Yet, in an ironic twist, the company's very success has created favorable conditions for its rivals to take down the AI titan a notch or two from atop its perch. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) realizes the opportunity a supply-constrained Nvidia has presented and intends to fully exploit these fortuitous circumstances to its advantage.\n\nWhy the Nvidia spillover effect creates unparalleled opportunities for AMD\n\nNvidia's unprecedented revenue growth, its rising stock price and consequential market capitalization have all demonstrated that the AI infrastructure market is sustainable and unbounded. Hyper-demand for Nvidia's chips has dispelled any lingering doubts that AI mania is merely another dot.com bubble waiting to burst.\n\nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU)chips are the lifeblood of generative AI systems. Semiconductor companies, such as AMD, provide the essential chip architecture capabilities necessary to create and sustain such systems. Tech companies that build or design these indispensable components are the only businesses at present able to convert the AI hype into an appreciable revenue reality.\n\nHardware companies such as Dell and Lenovo, as well as cloud providers, need AI chips immediately at competitive prices to meet rising customer demand. They can't secure chips from Nvidia fast enough, which means buying GPU hardware from other sources.\n\nRealizing the profit potential presented by this current supply and demand imbalance, AMD has stepped into this supply void swiftly. It has seized this opportunity by quickly ramping up production of its AI GPU series 1300 processors as an alternative to Nvidia's offerings for a tech sector hungry for data center chips.\n\nAMD looks poised to grow its AI presence\n\nLike other semiconductor companies, over the past two years, AMD has suffered from a chip glut that is only now starting to dissipate as tech companies wind down their excess inventories. Poor performance in the company's two non-data center segments resulted in tepid overall revenue growth of 2% year-over-year.The company's gaming segment was down 48% year-over-year; its embedded segment, which provides processing needs for the industrial, automotive and testing industries, fell 46% year-over-year.\n\nThe more telling metric for ascertaining the company's prospects, however, is the astounding growth in the company's data center business. Revenues from this segment grew an astounding 80% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. The client segment, which provides CPUs for servers, laptops, mobile and desktop devices, surged 85% to $1.4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccelerated growth from the data center and client segments prompted the company to raise its full-year 2024 guidance from $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion. CEO Lisa Su stated that based on customer engagements, these estimates are realistic.\n\nOver time, earnings from AMD's cloud GPU sales will far surpass that of the two non-data center segments that have dragged down overall revenue.\n\nA compelling investment opportunity for long-term appreciation\n\nGiven its flat year-over-year revenue growth, at 46 times the next twelve months' earnings, AMD's current valuation appears to be stretched. At 47 for the same multiple, Nvidia barely beats AMD by this same metric, even though its recent growth rate has been much greater.\n\nSince it's categorized as a semiconductor stock, AMD's current valuation, however, doesn't fully reflect its long-term revenue potential. For a company just entering the AI GPU business, AMD's data center growth was off the charts. The market will continue to respond favorably to AMD's offerings because cloud providers welcome the competition. Many don't want to be locked into Nvidia's ecosystem.\n\nBy some estimates, the AI market could grow to $403 billion by 2027 and $1 trillion by 2030. These projections demonstrate the extent to which AMD can benefit from AI's long-term revenue potential.\n\nCloud providers want competitive chip pricing which opens a wide door for AMD and others to carve into Nvidia's market share. With its focused AI data center strategy, over time, AMD's valuation as an AI stock will grow, as the company's increasing earnings reveal that its long-term AI growth potential is sustainable.\n\nInvestors shouldn't expect any short-term gains from the stock. Purchasing AMD is suitable only for those with a long-term investment horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "3 Little-Known Perks of a Costco Executive Membership",
    "body": "\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\nAs everyday prices continue to rise, more shoppers are looking for ways to trim their spending. One option is joining a Costco warehouse club to shop for the best deals.\n\nBut you must pay a membership fee to have the privilege of shopping here. The retailer has two membership types: a Gold Star membership and the pricier Executive membership, which offers more benefits like 2% back on most purchases.\n\nBefore investing in an Executive membership, consider whether you'll use the extra membership perks. Here are a few lesser-known benefits of a Costco Executive membership.\n\n1. Save more money when you order checks\n\nIf you need to order checks, an Executive Membership can help you save even more money. Costco partners with Harland Clarke to provide check-printing services to its members. As a bonus, all check orders include free, trackable standard delivery.\n\n2. Access additional travel benefits\n\nYou'll also get access to additional travel perks as an Executive member. All members get access to the same travel booking rates. But Executive members can get additional extras on select Costco Travel bookings.\n\nThis may include complimentary room upgrades, food and drink credits, and spa credits. These additional amenities can improve your vacation experience and give you more value from your membership.\n\nExecutive members earn 2% rewards on their Costco spending. You can earn up to $1,000 in rewards yearly when you make eligible Costco purchases, including Costco Travel purchases. For frequent travelers, this membership upgrade can be well worth it.\n\n3. Get extra insurance benefits\n\nAs a Cosco Executive member, you also qualify for additional insurance perks when you purchase insurance policies through Costco's insurance partners.\n\nOne example is an enrollment fee waiver for pet insurance policies purchased through Figo. Another example is free roadside assistance included with auto insurance policies purchased through CONNECT. Executive members who buy a homeowners insurance policy through CONNECT qualify for up to $100 lockout services per occurrence. Up to two claims can be made within any consecutive 12-month period.\n\nExecutive members also qualify for glass repair reimbursement if their home is broken into and they report a claim. These additional insurance perks add value to your membership.\n\nConsider your needs and goals\n\nIf you're planning on joining Costco and are comparing membership types, take some time to consider your needs and goals. What are you looking to get out of your membership? Can you benefit from the additional perks of a Costco Executive membership?\n\nStory continues\n\nYou should also review your finances. You'll pay $120 annually to become an Executive member. However, a Gold Star membership only costs $60 a year.\n\nEarn rewards when you shop at Costco\n\nIn addition to saving money when you shop at Costco, you can also earn rewards. Our No. 1 strategy for saving money at Costco is to use a rewards credit card to pay for your purchases. For regular shoppers, the rewards can add up fast. Check out our list of the best credit cards for Costco to learn more about each credit card's features.\n\nTop credit card to use at Costco (and everywhere else!)\n\nIf you\u2019re shopping with a debit card, you could be missing out on hundreds or even thousands of dollars each year.

    "title": "Is Now the Time to Buy Micron Technology Stock?",
    "body": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market has exploded over the past year, and among the businesses benefiting from this growth is Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). The company's sales are soaring because AI systems require lots of computer memory and storage, exactly the products Micron specializes in.\n\nThis led to an amazing run-up in the company's share price. Last July, Micron stock was at a 52-week low of $60.50. Fast-forward a year, and shares more than doubled to hit a high of $157.54 in June.\n\nBut after announcing results for its fiscal third quarter, ended May 30, Micron's stock price plunged. Does this create an opening to buy shares, or does the price drop suggest a reason to avoid investing in Micron?\n\nHere's a look into the company's performance to answer those questions and determine if Micron is a worthwhile investment over the long run.\n\nMicron's financial performance\n\nMicron's post-earnings share price decline was due to its fiscal Q4 financial forecast failing to impress Wall Street. The company estimated Q4 revenue to come in around $7.6 billion, which is a 90% increase over the prior year's $4 billion.\n\nTo put this guidance into context, here's how Micron's revenue has fared over its fiscal 2024.\n\nFiscal Quarter Revenue YOY Change Q4 2024 $7.6 billion (company guidance) 90% Q3 2024 $6.8 billion 82% Q2 2024 $5.8 billion 58% Q1 2024 $4.7 billion 16%\n\nData source: Micron Technology. YOY = year-over-year.\n\nAs you can see, Micron's revenue has been growing every quarter this fiscal year, thanks to the customer demand generated by the advent of AI. And looking deeper at Micron's fiscal Q3, performance was solid across multiple financial metrics.\n\nThe company's Q3 free cash flow (FCF) of $425 million is a substantial reversal from last year's negative FCF of $1.4 billion.\n\nIn addition, Micron exited Q3 with a healthy balance sheet. Total assets were $66.3 billion with $7.6 billion in cash and equivalents. Total liabilities were $22 billion.\n\nMicron's current demand environment\n\nOverall, Micron had a good third quarter, and its streak of rising revenue looks poised to continue because of the growing AI market. The AI industry is forecasted to expand from 2023's $136 billion to $827 billion by 2030.\n\nMicron is capturing its share of this market. In fact, Micron management stated its high-bandwidth memory chips, needed for AI to process data and make complex calculations, are already sold out for this year and 2025 as well.\n\nGiven the robust demand environment, Micron raised prices. As a result, the company's gross margin has grown, increasing from 19% in fiscal Q2 to 27% in Q3. Micron expects its gross margin to go up yet again in Q4 to around 34%.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand for its products coupled with the AI market's rapid growth led CFO Mark Murphy to state Micron expects \"record revenue and significantly better profitability in fiscal 2025.\"\n\nTo buy or not to buy Micron stock\n\nMicron is on a roll right now. But in evaluating it as a long-term investment, it's important to note Micron operates in a cyclical industry. This means while AI provides a boost today, at some point, the company will eventually face an industry downturn.\n\nFor example, in Q2 of its 2023 fiscal year, revenue dropped over 50% to $3.7 billion from the previous year's $7.8 billion. At the time, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra explained this by saying, \"The semiconductor memory and storage industry is facing its worst downturn in the last 13 years.\"\n\nNow, the company's fortunes have reversed, and with the AI market in the early years of expansion, Micron is well positioned to continue growing revenue.\n\nThat growth led Mehrotra to declare that \"Micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multiyear growth opportunity driven by AI.\"\n\nDespite Wall Street's disappointment with Micron's Q4 guidance, the current consensus among Wall Street analysts is a buy rating with a median share price of $165 for Micron stock. This suggests a belief the share price will go up.\n\nGiven AI's multiyear tailwind to Micron's sales growth, and with shares down after its recent earnings report, now is a good time to buy Micron stock and hold it over the long term as the AI market expands.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "How the IRS is using a bigger budget \u2014 and more \u2018swagger\u2019 \u2014 to audit more rich taxpayers. \u2018They are pushing hard now.\u2019",
    "body": "The taxman isn\u2019t playing around, lawyers, accountants and tax specialists say \u2014 the IRS is ramping up enforcement. Here\u2019s what that looks like on the receiving end. - MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto\n\nAnyone on the receiving end of an IRS audit will say there\u2019s never a good time to open up the books for Uncle Sam\u2019s revenue agents.\n\nThat\u2019s never felt more true, say people who\u2019ve witnessed the Internal Revenue Service in action recently.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\nIRS auditors have more questions, more staff and are acting more assertive, according to lawyers and accountants who advise very upscale clients on taxes.\n\nIn 2022\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, the IRS landed billions of dollars in funding over a decade to make sure rich households, partnerships and corporations were paying all of their owed taxes. The funding was intended to revive sagging audit rates at an agency that\u2019s been slowly sapped of money and people over the past decade.\n\nSince then, the agency has been publicizing its efforts to collect back taxes from delinquent millionaires and to rake in tax returns that millionaires failed to file.\n\nThe IRS has also talked about combing through corporate-jet records and using artificial intelligence to spot tax returns worth scrutiny. Most recently, the agency announced an effort to stop a \u201cshell game\u201d that large, complex partnerships allegedly use to churn up tax deductions.\n\nNow, tax professionals are seeing that talk turn into action.\n\n\u201cRight after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, I started seeing increased swagger, for lack of a better word. For a while, it seemed like just swagger,\u201d said Robert Kovacev, a member at the law firm Miller & Chevalier. His clients include corporations, partnerships and ultrarich families worth between millions and billions of dollars.\n\n\u201cFor the first time really now, I\u2019m starting to see the effects of the funding,\u201d he told MarketWatch.\n\nThe \u201cswagger\u201d that Kovacev sees now is displayed in the extra questions he has to field from the IRS, increasingly on topics that weren\u2019t part of an audit\u2019s starting scope.\n\nBefore the Inflation Reduction Act, Kovacev said the IRS was already viewing high-net-worth families as economic \u201centerprises\u201d with a sprawling financial footprint where tax noncompliance could sprout in all sorts of ways.\n\nStory continues\n\nA family\u2019s trusts, companies, partnership interests and charitable-giving tactics might all be places where auditors could poke and prod. \u201cBut without the resources they needed, there was only so much they could do,\u201d he said.\n\nNow he sees IRS agents ready to veer farther and farther from the audit\u2019s beginning focus. \u201cIt was kind of rare if you had an exam team color outside of the lines,\u201d Kovacev said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make that assumption anymore.\u201d\n\nIRS agents combing through a massive tax return have \u201can infinite number of avenues [they] can follow, but can\u2019t follow all of them,\u201d Kovacev noted. \u201cSometimes you find things worth exploring, but you let go. They are starting not to let those go so quickly.\u201d\n\nIRS auditors are digging deeper\n\nNiles Elber, a member at law firm Caplin & Drysdale, said IRS auditors seem willing to dig deeper these days. \u201cI might describe it as eagerness,\u201d he said. There are millions of dollars hanging in the balance in the tax cases he handles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time now,\u201d Elber said. \u201cWhen I first started, the agents I worked with usually concentrated on the most important things or the most important issues, usually with the most significant financial impact. And other things that were less significant were pushed by the wayside as a means of economizing. I\u2019m not sure I see that now. Now, we\u2019re going to drill down on everything.\u201d\n\nThe IRS isn\u2019t \u2018outgunned\u2019 anymore\n\nAfter years of budget cuts and shrinking staff, the IRS had been falling behind on its high-level enforcement, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said at a recent tax conference. In 2021, his predecessor, Charles Rettig, said the agency was getting \u201cout-gunned.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s changing now, but it\u2019s \u201ca long process,\u201d Werfel said.\n\n\u201c[W]e have to have the patience to be playing the long game,\u201d according to Werfel, who occasionally refers to complex audits as a chess game.\n\n\u201cSo many of the taxpayers at this end of the spectrum are doing the right thing and playing by the rules. But there are a material number of taxpayers that are not,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans fear the IRS will run roughshod over taxpayers\n\nWhile debates heat up on the future of tax laws and tax revenue to fill a gaping federal budget deficit, it\u2019s important to understand what the IRS is doing to try to extract more money through existing laws. It\u2019s also important to remember that a stronger audit flex from a more muscular IRS has its critics.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act passed in a Democratic-controlled Congress without any Republican votes in support. The law awarded $80 billion to the IRS over a decade to replenish its ranks and upgrade operations. More than half of the sum was earmarked for tighter tax enforcement.\n\nThe IRS plans to boost audits on taxpayers worth at least $400,000 under a Treasury Department directive that came days before President Joe Biden signed the bill into law. Below the $400,000 mark, the IRS will not use the extra funding to increase audit rates from historical levels, the directive said. Specifically, the benchmark is the audit rates on 2018 returns, Werfel has said.\n\nThe enforcement money has been a flash point for Republicans, who have successfully negotiated just over $20 billion out of the Inflation Reduction Act funding.\n\nRepublicans say they don\u2019t want an IRS that runs roughshod over taxpayers. Many aren\u2019t convinced that the agency really will confine its attention to wealthier earners. Democrats counter that Republicans just want to take the heat off well-heeled tax cheats.\n\nThe fight over the IRS budget continues, with House Republicans looking to reduce enforcement-related money in the upcoming budget year.\n\n\u2018The breeze before the storm\u2019\n\nWith the IRS stepping up enforcement on upper-income taxpayers, Michael Sardar, a partner handling tax disputes at the law firm Kostelanetz, is already getting calls from crypto investors who may have underreported their gains to the IRS, longtime nonfilers (meaning people who have repeatedly failed to file tax returns) and others worried they might be in the agency\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nThey\u2019re asking how to get their taxes in order and come clean with the tax agency before IRS notices arrive and make their tax situation worse, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite right to call this period \u201cthe calm before the storm,\u201d according to Sardar. There\u2019s a better way to describe the moment, he said: \u201cThe breeze before the storm.\u201d\n\nMore IRS staff means more questions to answer during audits\n\nWhat does that storm feel like to the people who are either getting audited, or are worried about it?\n\nAround the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s passage, one assertion from GOP critics was that the IRS would be hiring a new phalanx of aggressive auditors. Overall, the agency now has nearly 90,000 full-time equivalent employees, up from 79,000 in fiscal year 2022, thanks to the new funding. Almost 9,100 of those are revenue agents \u2014 the employees who conduct audits.\n\nThe plan is to bring the IRS\u2019s head count for its entire staff to 102,500 in fiscal year 2029, Werfel said last month, noting that\u2019s still under the IRS\u2019s head count in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The agency\u2019s hiring goal \u201cshould lay to rest any lingering myth about a super-sized IRS,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nStill, a common refrain about high-end IRS audits these days is that there are more people involved \u2014 and having more people means answering more questions.\n\nElber used to work with one or two IRS agents during an audit, with one being the lead agent and the other serving as a specialist or supervisor.\n\nNow, the exam teams can have up to eight people, he said. He\u2019s also noticed a new feature: recurring conference calls for updates on the audit. \u201cAcross the board, they are pushing hard now. They are moving cases along with deliberate speed,\u201d Elber said.\n\nOnce a tax return is filed, the IRS says it generally has three years to assess extra tax. It may go back further if auditors uncover a glaring error, but it says it typically doesn\u2019t look back any further than six years. The exam concludes with an IRS recommendation on how much more money the taxpayer owes the government.\n\nThe agency may not necessarily suggest an adjustment, but says it tries to minimize these \u201cno-change\u201d audits that bog down taxpayers who have followed the rules.\n\nIf the IRS and the taxpayer can\u2019t agree on the size of the extra bill, the process can move to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals or an array of federal courts.\n\nIRS is reaching for new audit goals\n\nThe tax agency is trying to make 2026 a milestone. When tax returns are filed for that year, the IRS wants to be auditing 16.5% of households with a total positive income of at least $10 million, up from 11%.\n\nIn 2020, the Trump administration\u2019s Treasury Department directed the IRS to audit at least 8% of taxpayers worth $10 million. The IRS kept up with that goal in returns filed for 2018, 2019 and 2020, a recent Treasury watchdog report found.\n\nBut the IRS said it isn\u2019t following the 2020 directive anymore because it views the goal as out of date, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report said.\n\nWhen it comes to corporate income-tax returns filed for 2026, the IRS plans to examine more than 22% of tax returns for corporations with assets of at least $250 million.\n\nBy then, it plans to audit 1% of partnership returns with at least $10 million in assets. The IRS already said it\u2019s launching 76 audits of lucrative partnerships, including certain law firms, hedge funds and real-estate investment trusts.\n\nA 1% target may sound humble, but it\u2019s a 900% increase from the 0.1% audit rate in 2019 for these large partnerships, where the earnings pass through the business to the partners in tax arrangements that can become extremely complicated.\n\n\u2018How do I make sure I\u2019m the smallest target?\u2019\n\nThe best defense against an audit may be minimizing its chances in the first place.\n\n\u201cPeople are really thinking about \u2018How do I make sure I\u2019m the smallest target I can be?\u2019\u201d said Jane Ditelberg, senior vice president and tax-planning director at the Northern Trust Institute.\n\nNo matter the taxpayer\u2019s income level, avoiding the red flags that could spark an audit still largely boils down to the basics: Make sure all income is reported and make sure all the math is correct on a return, she said.\n\nSteer clear of tax techniques where the IRS has already announced its skepticism, she added. That includes not falling for a \u201cweird\u201d reading of a U.S.-Malta tax treaty that lulls people into thinking they\u2019ve shielded their retirement money from U.S. taxes. Elsewhere, be extra careful to follow all instructions on \u201creportable transactions\u201d where the IRS is on guard for misuse, Ditelberg noted. Massive monetary losses are one example of a reportable transaction.\n\nThe Schedule C tax form for business profits and losses can be a trouble spot if there are chronic losses. The IRS may think the venture is a hobby instead of a bona fide business with deductions and losses that can legitimately offset income.\n\nIn the rarified world of upper-income taxpayers, the IRS may have questions about whether a taxpayer\u2019s ranch really is a working ranch, or if their yacht leasing is something other than a side endeavor. Questions about the real value of upscale, difficult-to-value charitable donations \u2014 like a donated weekend stay at a vacation home \u2014 could attract unwanted attention if not handled correctly, Ditelberg said.\n\nAt Kostelanetz, a growing share of Sardar\u2019s work is advising people on how they can get their taxes in order before the IRS shows up. He\u2019s already well acquainted with the IRS\u2019s voluntary disclosure practice, where he helps people get on the right side of the IRS after they fess up to their unreported income and work out a deal with the agency on the consequences.\n\nThere are now people contacting Sardar who haven\u2019t filed tax returns in years, sometimes decades. \u201cThose are people who thought for a long time, \u2018I\u2019m off the radar,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey seem to be reassessing that comfort. They seem to be realizing or recognizing it\u2019s a false comfort.\u201d\n\nIs the IRS\u2019s focus on auditing high-income taxpayers fair?\n\nLet\u2019s face it: Many Americans may not hold much sympathy for rich people and businesses that are spending money to duel with the taxman over their bill.\n\nBut the IRS itself says taxpayers have a \u201cbill of rights.\u201d That includes the right to a \u201cfair and just tax system\u201d and \u201cthe right to pay no more than the correct amount of tax.\u201d\n\nAt the conference earlier this month, Werfel said tougher enforcement is a win for overall fairness and a victory for those who follow the rules.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a CFO or CEO and you run a large company, a multinational company, and you are playing by the rules, you want an IRS that makes sure your competitors are playing by the rules and that there\u2019s an even playing field,\u201d he said.\n\nAn audit is one way to do that, but Kovacev said the process can be \u201ca fishing expedition.\u201d The Inflation Reduction Act \u201cgave the IRS a bigger license to fish,\u201d he noted.\n\nIt\u2019s fair game to use the new funding to catch people who are not paying the IRS what they owe, he added. Yet the $400,000 pledge aims the IRS net squarely at his clients.\n\n\u201cYou have to wonder, are they going after where the money is? Or are they going where the politicians want them to go?\u201d Kovacev said.\n\nCaplin & Drysdale\u2019s Elber said it\u2019s a good thing if more IRS audits and investigations bring the system to a place where everyone is paying all their tax obligations. \u201cYou want there to be fairness and uniformity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe trick is knowing when enough is enough \u2014 so there\u2019s a balance the IRS needs to find within itself, he added.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t believe in is grinding a taxpayer to dust and looking at every possible issue one could look at,\u201d Elber said.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch",

    "title": "Billionaire Warren Buffett Has 99% of His Money Invested in 1 Brilliant Stock",
    "body": "Warren Buffett is currently the tenth-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In June 2024, Buffett not only estimated his net worth at more than $127 billion, but also candidly mentioned that 99% of that total was invested in a single stock: Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nBuffett acquired an ownership stake in Berkshire about six decades ago, and his considerable investing prowess has molded the company into a diversified conglomerate worth $875 billion. Under his leadership, Berkshire shares compounded at 19.8% annually between 1965 and 2023, nearly doubling the annualized return in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the same period.\n\nBuffett is undoubtedly one of the greatest minds in American business, which makes his conviction in Berkshire all the more noteworthy. Here's what investors should know about this brilliant stock.\n\nBerkshire has two important advantages\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is a holding company that owns dozens of subsidiaries that fall into three segments: (1) insurance, (2) railroad, utilities, and energy, and (3) manufacturing, service, and retailing. The structure of the business is advantageous for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies in the world. As a result, it consistently generates investable cash in the form of insurance premiums. Warren Buffett explained that facet of the business in his 2009 shareholder letter.\n\n\"Insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers' compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums -- money we call \"float\" -- that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire's benefit.\"\n\nBuffett has invested that float to great effect over the years. Berkshire's book value per share, a good yardstick for measuring changes in its intrinsic value, has increased at 11.1% annually over the last decade.\n\nThe second reason Berkshire's business structure is advantageous is that many of its subsidiaries provide goods and services that are somewhat recession-proof. That is particularly true of those involved in insurance underwriting (Geico), freight rail transportation (Burlington Northern Santa Fe), and utility services (Pilot and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company).\n\nAs a result, Berkshire Hathaway has historically outperformed the S&P 500 during bear markets, as shown in the chart below.\n\nStory continues\n\nBear Market Start Date S&P 500 Maximum Decline Berkshire Hathaway Maximum Decline March 2000 (49%) (24%) October 2007 (57%) (54%) February 2020 (34%) (30%) January 2022 (25%) (27%) Average (41%) (34%)\n\nData source: Yardeni Research, Ycharts.\n\nBerkshire reported solid financial results in the first quarter\n\nBerkshire looked stalwart in the first quarter. Revenue increased 5% to $89.9 billion due to strong sales growth in the insurance and utilities subsidiaries, offset by modest sales declines across subsidiaries in other segments. Meanwhile, operating earnings before income tax increased 31% to $12.5 billion.\n\nThe graphic below shows Berkshire's operating earnings before income tax across its three primary business segments. Importantly, those earnings do not include investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized. But they do include investment income, such as dividends from stocks and interest earned on U.S. Treasury bills.\n\nBerkshire's insurance subsidiaries were the primary driver of operating earnings before income tax in the first quarter.\n\nBerkshire stock trades at a tolerable valuation\n\nGoing forward, CFRA analyst Catherine Seifert expects Berkshire to grow operating earnings per share at 12% annually over the next three years. That may be conservative given that operating earnings per share increased at 23% annually over the last three years. However, even accounting for that deceleration, the current valuation of 21.7 times operating earnings is tolerable.\n\nWe can also examine valuation from another perspective. Berkshire shares currently trade at 1.5 times book value. That is a slight premium to the three-year average of 1.4 times book value, but it's not unreasonable.\n\nInvestors should not kid themselves into thinking Berkshire is cheap. But the stock kept pace with the S&P 500 over the last five years, and I think it can do the same over the next five, while offering the added benefit of outperformance during down markets.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "2 Soaring Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Aren't Just Hype",
    "body": "It seems that all modern technological innovations undergo a hype cycle of sorts. The most famous is the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Nasdaq more than doubled from the beginning of 1997 through the March 2000 zenith. Many think an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble is forming now; many others disagree. One of the key differences between companies now and those during the dot-com bubble is profitability.\n\nWhile many tech companies back then had little sales and no profits, dozens of companies in the AI industry today are cash-flow positive, have soaring revenue, or are highly profitable -- not just hyped. This is a critical distinction that can help guide your investment strategy. Here are two companies that fit this mold.\n\nMicron Technology\n\nIf there is one thing that AI needs, it is data, and this data needs memory -- tons of it. Micron (NASDAQ: MU) is a global leader in providing DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and NAND (flash memory), which are used in smartphones, PCs, memory cards, data centers, etc. After a rough fiscal 2023, Micron is back in a major way.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Micron battled geopolitical problems that hampered Chinese sales and a market where its products were not in demand due to oversupply. In other words, many of its customers were using existing inventory rather than purchasing more from Micron. Sales fell from $31 billion in fiscal 2022 to $16 billion in fiscal 2023. The industry is cyclical; in 2023, it was down, but now things are looking up.\n\nAI powers two trends that will be tailwinds for Micron. First, hundreds of data centers are coming online every year, and this trend is expected to continue for many years. Micron's management says that its HBM (high-bandwidth memory) sales will reach hundreds of millions this fiscal year and \"multiple billions\" next fiscal year. Next, AI will increase demand for upgrading PCs and smartphones, and these AI-ready systems will require more memory, a direct benefit to Micron.\n\nMicron reported $6.8 billion in revenue in the third quarter of fiscal-year 2024, an 81% increase over the prior year and a significant margin improvement due to high demand. Operating income improved year over year from a loss of $1.8 billion to a profit of $719 million.\n\nThe stock's valuation is out of whack due to its profitability last year and incremental recovery this year. This year's average analyst earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations are just $1.23, giving Micron a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio over 100 at the current price; however, this isn't the whole story. As shown below, analysts predict a massive EPS jump next year to $9.48, which would make the P/E only 14.\n\nStory continues\n\nMU PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe low valuation based on fiscal 2025 estimates and significant tailwinds make Micron a solid long-term investment.\n\nCrowdStrike\n\nCybersecurity is always a priority for executives because the costs of breaches, in terms of direct costs, downtime, recovery, etc., can be immense. Most successful breaches occur through endpoints, so companies clamor for protection from AI-powered protection like CrowdStrike's (NASDAQ: CRWD) Falcon platform.\n\nFalcon is entirely cloud-based and modular, so companies can add features as needed. Selling additional modules is part of CrowdStrike's land-and-expand sales strategy, which works well. As of Q1 FY25, 65% of customers used at least five modules, and 28% used seven or more.\n\nThe demand for endpoint protection drives incredible growth for CrowdStrike's sales and free cash flow, as shown below.\n\nCRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe incredible rise in sales and nearly 32% free-cash-flow margin over the last 12 months show why investors are buying the stock hand over fist. The stock is up 50% so far in 2024 and 500% over the past five years. However, the epic rise has pushed the stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio extremely high.\n\nCrowdStrike's P/S ratio now stands near 29, higher than fellow high-growth software company Palantir and cybersecurity companies like Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler:\n\nCRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nCRWD PS Ratio data by YCharts\n\nInvestors should be cautious about buying CrowdStrike because of its valuation; however, the company's results are spectacular, and it has a tremendous future.\n\nThe artificial intelligence boom is in full swing, and many companies are reaping the rewards.

    "title": "Forget the \"Magnificent Seven.\" What About the Incredible Eight?",
    "body": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" was a phrase coined by CNBC's Jim Cramer to group the most dominant stocks in the market. The seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft Apple Nvidia Alphabet Amazon Meta Platforms Tesla\n\nWhile this is a solid list, I believe it leaves out one incredibly important business. In fact, if this company didn't exist, these seven companies wouldn't look the same.\n\nSo, instead of the Magnificent Seven, I'm proposing the Incredible Eight, which adds Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) to the cohort.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's product innovation has kept it on top of its industry\n\nWith a $900 billion market cap, TSMC is actually the seventh-largest company listed on U.S. exchanges -- larger than Tesla's $585 billion.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a chip foundry, meaning companies design chips and then outsource the manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor, which has the expertise to create them. The company is the market leader in this space and has industry-leading 3 nanometer (nm) chip technology that allows it to manufacture the most powerful chips possible right now. Additionally, TSMC has a culture of continuous innovation, and the next generation of 2nm chips is slated to launch sometime in 2025.\n\nAlthough TSMC doesn't name all its clients, every member of the Magnificent Seven is either a direct or indirect customer. That's a great position to be in, and a TSMC investment gives investors a chance to benefit from all technological innovations made by the original Magnificent Seven.\n\nAnd multiple catalysts are in line to boost its business.\n\nTSMC is about to experience two significant tailwinds\n\nIn Apple's latest announcement, it launched Apple Intelligence, its take on artificial intelligence (AI). In this announcement was the kicker that only the latest generation of iPhones and newer will have access to this technology, so consumers will have to upgrade to gain access to this feature. Over the past three years, Apple essentially made up a quarter of TSMC's revenue, so if this ignites an upgrade cycle, TSMC will be a huge beneficiary.\n\nThis is a big relief, as 38% of TSMC's revenue in the first quarter came from the smartphone segment, which saw its quarter-over-quarter revenue figure drop by 16%. Given how important smartphones are to TSMC's business, it's critical that this area turns around.\n\nHowever, another division, AI, is also starting to shine. Management projects a 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next five years with AI-related hardware. After that catalyst is complete, it projects it will make up around 20% of total revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's massive growth from a segment that is just emerging, and it's critical to get in before the lion's share of that growth occurs.\n\nBoth factors give credence to management's long-term goal of growing revenue at a 15% to 20% CAGR for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's rare to find a company that consistently delivers that kind of growth over the long term, but Taiwan Semiconductor is well-positioned to do it. As a result, I think it's one of the best stocks to buy now and hold for the long term.\n\nOne slight caveat to this pitch is that Taiwan Semiconductor's stock isn't the cheapest at 28 times forward earnings.\n\nTSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHowever, considering that other Magnificent Seven members like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla trade at much higher multiples, it's still a fair price to pay.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's long-term trajectory is just too good to ignore, and every investor should consider owning some shares. Although I don't know if the Incredible Eight will become a trend, I think adding Taiwan Semiconductor to this cohort makes sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Roaring Kitty Owns $217 Million of Chewy Stock. Should You Get In Now?",
    "body": "Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, has a new favorite stock.\n\nThe man behind the GameStop meme stock phenomenon filed a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 1 showing that on June 24, he took a 6.6% stake in Chewy (NYSE: CHWY). As of the close of trading on July 3, that stake was worth about $217 million. That's a massive bet for Gill.\n\nThe combination of Gill's bullishness and his social media following has made the stock extremely volatile. Shares surged higher when Gill posted a picture of a cartoon dog on X in late June, and they moved again following the SEC disclosure. But Chewy stock has already given back most all the gains it made since Gill made his big purchase, and then some. That gives those who might be interested in following him into the stock an opportunity to get in at a similar price.\n\nShould retail investors seriously consider taking a cue from this YOLO bet by the meme stock king?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe leading online retailer for all kitties (and other pets)\n\nChewy is the biggest online retailer of pet products. Pets are common in U.S. households, and the amount people spend on them is growing rapidly. The American Pet Products Association forecasts that Americans will spend over $150 billion on their pets this year, up from $90 billion in 2018.\n\nThat puts Chewy in a favorable position. In online retail, size matters. It makes fulfilling and shipping orders more efficient, thus reducing one of e-commerce's biggest expenses. Chewy uses that advantage in two ways. First, it's able to offer competitive pricing on pet supplies and over-the-counter medicines thanks to its operating efficiency. Second, it's leveraging its existing customer base to expand into new verticals.\n\nSpecifically, Chewy has expanded its efforts in advertising and healthcare. Veterinary care and pharmaceuticals account for more than 25% of that $150 billion in pet industry spending. That's a massive market for Chewy to take a slice out of.\n\nChewy Health is just getting started. The company opened four vet care clinics this year and plans to open up to four more by year's end. A higher mix shift to healthcare products among its online sales led to strong gross margin expansion in the first quarter.\n\nLikewise, strong ad sales boosted revenue and gross margin. The company expects its advertising revenues will grow to become 1% to 3% of its total top line. While that sounds small, advertising sales can have a massive impact on the bottom line since ads command high operating margins.\n\nA loyal core customer base\n\nWhile the number of active Chewy customers has declined since the height of the pandemic, it has a growing core customer base.\n\nStory continues\n\nCustomers who use its recurring autoship feature accounted for 77.6% of sales in the first quarter. That was the highest percentage the company had ever recorded.\n\nAutoship is a win-win for Chewy and its customers. Customers get small discounts on items they purchase on a regular cadence such as treats or medicine. Chewy gains more predictability about its customers' orders, can package more items together to reduce shipping costs, and experiences higher customer retention.\n\nThe company is working to increase customer loyalty with a new paid membership program, Chewy Plus, that offers unlimited free shipping, rewards, and exclusive perks. The program is currently in the testing phase.\n\nBoth autoship, its new membership program, and its growing healthcare business (with physical locations) can be great ways to foster customer loyalty, and they can all work in concert.\n\nIs Chewy stock a roaring buy?\n\nAt their recent prices, Chewy shares look like good value.\n\nThe company's enterprise value is about about 20 times its forward EBITDA estimates. And it should experience strong bottom-line growth as revenue climbs higher and margins expand thanks to its advertising and healthcare efforts. Analysts currently expect its earnings per share (EPS) will grow 178% this year and 68% next year.\n\nEPS growth was further supported by the $500 million share repurchase program management announced in conjunction with its first-quarter earnings report. It executed that share repurchase in one fell swoop last month, buying 17.55 million shares at a price of $28.49 apiece from a single entity. It still has over $500 million left in cash on its balance sheet, based on its first-quarter report, and it generates positive free cash flow every quarter.\n\nWhile a stock-buyback deal at that price doesn't look that impressive when shares trade for around $25 today, it does suggest that management felt it was a fair price for the shares. And management has better information than any outsider about the future finances of the company.\n\nWith strong growth ahead of it, Chewy is a company worth owning. Investors just need to be aware that Gill's involvement with the stock could create a lot of volatility in the share price.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late.

    "title": "2 Reasons to Buy Marvell Technology Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
    "body": "Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) could see demand for its semiconductor solutions explode over the next few years. Marvell's products are used in a wide range of goods, from game consoles and printers to enterprise workstations and artificial intelligence (AI) servers. But data center, including AI-related products, is its largest business, totaling 40% of its revenue last year.\n\nThe growth in AI infrastructure spending could significantly benefit Marvell's revenue growth and stock performance over the next year.\n\nThe risk for investors is buying the stock before a cyclical downswing in demand, which is common for the semiconductor industry. However, the industry has experienced a lot of growth over the last 40 years, so buying shares of leading companies as they emerge from a downswing can be to your advantage.\n\nHere are two reasons Marvell stock is a buy right now.\n\n1. Marvell is well positioned for growing AI demand\n\nMarvell reported a year-over-year decline of 12% in revenue in the fiscal first quarter of 2025 to $1.16 billion, but it is just starting to see a recovery after a weak year for demand across some of its business segments. The revenue decline was driven by weakness in enterprise networking, industrial, and consumer products. Management expects these markets to bottom in the second half of the year.\n\nThe reason to buy the stock now is the growth in Marvell's data center business, where revenue nearly doubled over the year-ago quarter to $876 million. Marvell is meeting a crucial need for AI-optimized data centers. It provides interconnects and other data transfer products that allow clusters of high-performance computing systems to communicate through high-speed connections -- a must-have for AI workloads.\n\nMarvell believes it has plenty of opportunities to expand its addressable market across AI compute programs, interconnect switching, and storage solutions. Management previously guided for AI-related revenue to reach $1.5 billion this year, or nearly 30% of its total revenue, before growing to $2.5 billion next year.\n\nOverall, Marvell sees the data center infrastructure addressable market tripling to $75 billion by 2028. This tailwind could fuel outstanding returns for shareholders.\n\n2. The stock is reasonably priced relative to growth expectations\n\nComing out of the recent downturn for the semiconductor industry, Wall Street is becoming increasingly bullish on Marvell's prospects. The average analyst expects the company's earnings per share to grow at an annualized rate of 34% over the long term. This is up from a low-double-digit estimate a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nHistorically, the best time to buy shares of Marvell or other semiconductor stocks is when the industry is turning the corner after a rough year. Now appears to be an ideal time to jump on board. Despite higher growth expectations, the stock is up 18% over the last 12 months but is still trading 24% below its previous peak.\n\nThe stock's recent advance has brought its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to a more expensive 50 multiple. However, the company should be able to grow into the stock's high valuation. For example, when considering next year's earnings estimate, the stock's forward P/E drops to a more reasonable 28.\n\nOnce Marvell's non-data center markets recover, such as enterprise networking and consumer products, the stock could be off to the races. With management anticipating a recovery in all of its end markets in the second half of the fiscal year, the stock looks like a great buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Marvell Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Marvell Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Marvell Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "How Can I Reduce My Tax Liability on a Roth IRA Conversion?",
    "body": "Converting your current retirement accounts to a Roth IRA is typically a very tax-efficient strategy. It can help lower your lifetime taxes significantly. However it does come with a large up-front bill.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to avoid conversion taxes completely, you can restructure them to make this much more manageable. By staggering out your conversion or timing it for years in which you have low tax liability or portfolio losses, you can reduce the impact of a Roth IRA conversion.\n\nIf you need help executing a strategy to minimize your taxes, speak to a financial advisor today.\n\nConverting to a Roth IRA Triggers Income Taxes\n\nTraditional qualifying employer-sponsored retirement accounts have opposite tax treatments compared to Roth IRAs.\n\nRetirement accounts such as traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, and 403(b)s are called \u201cpre-tax\u201d accounts. This means that while you may enjoy a tax break on your contributions going into these plans, you\u2019ll face full income taxes when you eventually make withdrawals. You effectively pay no income taxes on the money you put in but full income taxes on the money you take out.\n\nOn the other hand, Roth IRAs are called \u201cpost-tax\u201d accounts. While you cannot take a deduction for the money you contribute, you don\u2019t have to pay income taxes at all on your withdrawals. Effectively, you pay full income taxes on the money you put in but no income taxes on the money you take out.\n\nSince your portfolio gains will almost certainly exceed your contributions given enough time and the right allocations, a Roth IRA is one of the best tax-advantaged retirement accounts for most households. This is why many people like to take advantage of Roth IRA conversions \u2013 moving their money from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA to take advantage of the long-term tax savings.\n\nThere\u2019s a catch though. When you move money from an IRA into a Roth IRA, for instance, you must essentially make up for the initial deduction you took by paying income taxes on the full value of your conversion. In practice, this means that you add the value of a conversion to your taxable income for the year in which you took it. This can increase your taxes, sometimes by quite a lot depending on the size of your transfer.\n\nYou cannot avoid paying taxes on this money, however you can reduce the impact of a conversion. Here are a few strategies to consider.\n\nA financial advisor can help you weigh the pros and cons of a Roth conversion in your personal situation.\n\nStrategies to Reduce Your Conversion Taxes\n\nIf you\u2019re near retirement age, it\u2019s important to note that you cannot make penalty-free withdrawals from a Roth IRA for five years after you open the account. So, take that into consideration when deciding on a conversion strategy.\n\nStory continues\n\nStagger Conversions\n\nIt may make sense to avoid converting everything all at once. Instead, you can convert a little bit at a time. By making the conversion in pieces, you may be able to keep your tax bracket lower over a series of years, rather than if you converted everything up front.\n\nThe corollary to staggered conversion is tax bracket management. When you convert your IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA, you will add the value of this conversion to your taxable income for the year. If you\u2019re not careful, this can raise your AGI enough to push you into a new tax bracket. While this won\u2019t affect your taxes on income below the cutoff, you\u2019ll pay even more in taxes on any conversion money above the new bracket.\n\nIt can be very useful to keep an eye on how a conversion will affect your taxes. Convert enough to maximize your current bracket, but not enough to push you into a higher one.\n\nIt may also be helpful to consider that the longer you take to convert your IRA, the more time your portfolio will have to grow and the more you may ultimately have to move (and pay taxes on). You also could miss out on tax-free growth in the Roth during this time.\n\nSpeak to a financial advisor to explore ways to maximize your retirement income and minimize taxes.\n\nOffset Capital Gains Losses\n\nWhen you take investment losses, you can offset investment gains down to $0. After that, you can use investment losses to offset up to $3,000 in taxable income per year, indefinitely, as well.\n\nThis can be an excellent opportunity to do a limited Roth IRA conversion. By writing down up to $3,000 in capital gains losses, you can offset some of the increased taxable income that you will see from the IRA.\n\nTime Conversions to Market Downturns\n\nSimilarly, you can also time your conversion to unrealized losses in the stock market.\n\nWhen you make a Roth IRA conversion, you increase your taxable income by the entire amount converted. As a result, you\u2019re better off moving the smallest amount of money possible. This makes market downturns an opportunity to minimize your tax liability. Time your conversion to when your IRA portfolio loses value. A 10% market downturn means that you might move 10% less cash over to your Roth IRA, reducing the impact on your taxes. However, you\u2019ll also be contributing less to the Roth than if the market was in better shape.\n\nA financial advisor can help you project your income and taxes in multiple scenarios.\n\nPay Attention to Income Triggers\n\nFinally, remember that the rules to many different programs are linked to your annual income. From student aid to Medicaid, tax credits and more, a vast number of different public and private entities base your eligibility on this or last year\u2019s taxable income.\n\nFor the self employed, this is particularly essential. Your real, estimated and self-employment taxes are all based on your AGI, so a change in your taxed income can change several different areas of taxation.\n\nMake sure to look at any program or grant that you depend on before making a conversion, and structure your conversion to keep your income below any applicable caps. You don\u2019t want to roll your portfolio over just to discover that doing so made you ineligible for tuition assistance.\n\nBottom Line\n\nA Roth IRA conversion is a very good long-term plan for most households, but it comes with a large tax bill attached. You cannot avoid paying those taxes, but you can structure your conversion to minimize its impact.\n\nRoth IRA Planning Tips\n\nTax advantages are all well and good, but a Roth IRA is really only valuable if it delivers growth. Otherwise, you\u2019re saving taxes on money that never actually happened. So\u2026 what kind of return can you expect from a Roth IRA?\n\nA financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/Xesai, \u00a9iStock.com/uchar, \u00a9iStock.com/Anna Frank\n\nThe post How to Reduce Your Tax Liability on a Roth IRA Conversion appeared first on SmartReads by SmartAsset.",

    "title": "Ask an Advisor: I'm 43 and a Divorced Dad. I Have $315K in an IRA, and $90K in Other Accounts. Can I Retire at 57?",
    "body": "Ask An Advisor: I'm a 43-Year-Old Divorced Dad With $315K in an IRA, $90K in a Roth and Other Accounts. I Max Out My 401(k) Each Year. Can I Retire at 57?\n\nI am a 43-year-old divorced father. I have $315,000 in a traditional individual retirement account (IRA), $90,000 in a Roth IRA, $22,000 in a health savings account (HSA), $8,000 in a 529 college savings account, $30,000 in a traditional 401k, $25,000 in U.S i-bonds, $40,000 invested in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and $20,000 in cash. I max out my employer\u2019s 401(k) and family HSA each year. At age 57, I\u2019d like to stop most of my full-time employment and start rolling over money from my traditional IRA into my Roth IRA, up to the standard deduction each year. I would try to live on nontaxable income during that time until at least age 62. I would then like to keep that up by living on my Roth accounts until age 67, at which point I would take Social Security, which would be around $3,500 per month and is pretty close to my actual monthly expenses. Am I overdoing it?\n\n-Jacob\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to commend you on both the savings you\u2019ve already accumulated and the amount of thought you\u2019ve put into this plan. All of that work has put you in a fantastic position to be able to retire on your own terms.\n\nSo, are you on track to retire at age 57? And are you overdoing it? Let\u2019s take a look. (And if you\u2019re looking for help with your own financial question, this tool can help match you with potential advisors.)\n\nBack-of-the-Envelope Math\n\nAsk An Advisor: I'm a 43-Year-Old Divorced Dad With $315K in an IRA, $90K in a Roth and Other Accounts. I Max Out My 401(k) Each Year. Can I Retire at 57?\n\nFor a quick look at your investing and savings situation, you can use the 4% rule and make some assumptions about your investment returns in order to see if you\u2019re on the right track.\n\nThe 4% rule says that when you retire, you can withdraw 4% of your total retirement savings each year, adjusting for inflation, with minimal risk of running out of money. You might not want to bet your entire financial plan on this rule, but there\u2019s plenty of research behind it. Using the 4% rule is a good way to see if you\u2019re on the right track.\n\nIf you start at age 43 with $522,000 in retirement savings (I\u2019m excluding your cash and 529 savings account since those are for other purposes), and assume a 4% annual inflation-adjusted rate of return with $29,700 in annual contributions, you reach age 57 with $1,468,936 across your various investment accounts.\n\nApplying the 4% rule to that $1,468,936 balance, you would be able to withdraw $58,757 per year, which sounds like it should be enough to cover your expenses.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s a simplified calculation that doesn\u2019t factor in Social Security or taxes, so let\u2019s dig a little deeper. (Looking for help with a financial question? This tool can help match you with potential advisors.)\n\nStory continues\n\nUsing SmartAsset\u2019s Retirement Calculator\n\nFor a more robust look, I used SmartAsset\u2019s retirement calculator and entered all of the details you provided in your question. I estimated your annual expenses at $60,000.\n\nAccording to that calculator, you would need $1,342,034 in order to retire at age 57 and you are on track to have $1,516,049. So again, it\u2019s looking like you\u2019re on the right track to meet your goals. (Looking for help with a financial question? This tool can help match you with potential advisors.)\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nAsk An Advisor: I'm a 43-Year-Old Divorced Dad With $315K in an IRA, $90K in a Roth and Other Accounts. I Max Out My 401(k) Each Year. Can I Retire at 57?\n\nWhile all of the above indicates that you are in very good shape, there are certain variables that we haven\u2019t accounted for above.\n\nOne big variable is the cost of college. There is a wide range of possibilities there, all the way from paying nothing to spending $70,000 or more per year for a private university. And while you do have some dedicated college savings, a big college expense could force you to dip into retirement savings, which could require you to either work longer or reduce your retirement spending.\n\nThere are also plenty of things about your situation that could change over the years, from your job to your health to the investment returns you receive to your personal goals. No financial plan, no matter how good, is ever a finished product and it is important to regularly reevaluate to make sure you\u2019re still on track.\n\nWhen it comes to your plan for withdrawals, especially in the early years of retirement, I would also be careful about making minimizing taxes too high of a priority. (Looking for help with a financial question? This tool can help match you with potential advisors.)\n\nYou certainly don\u2019t want to pay more than you have to, and being tax-conscious in your approach is the right idea. But it may be smart to have some taxable income in those earlier years to fill up those lower tax brackets, which might allow you to avoid higher tax brackets down the line and actually pay fewer taxes over the long term.\n\nI would also consider the possibility that living off cash and bonds during your first few years of retirement could cause your overall asset allocation to be more conservative than it needs to be for your goals and risk tolerance. It can certainly make sense to keep ample cash reserves so that you\u2019re not as susceptible to short-term market movements. But being too conservative could sacrifice long-term growth and security. And remember that paying taxes just means your money has grown, which is a good thing.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also important to acknowledge that there are many details about your situation that I don\u2019t know, so I\u2019m certainly not in any position to give you specific advice on withdrawal and tax strategies. These are just things to consider as you continue to fine-tune your plan.\n\nNext Steps\n\nYou seem to be right on track for your major goals with some wiggle room to weather the unexpected, which is right where you want to be. As long as you continue to review your goals, save and make adjustments along the way, you should be in good shape.\n\nInvesting and Retirement Planning Tips\n\nIf you have questions specific to your investing and retirement situation, a financial advisor can help. Finding a financial advisor doesn\u2019t have to be hard. SmartAsset\u2019s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you\u2019re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nAs you plan for retirement, keep an eye on Social Security. Use SmartAsset\u2019s Social Security calculator to get an idea of what your benefits could look like in retirement.\n\nKeep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.\n\nMatt Becker, CFP\u00ae, is a SmartAsset financial planning columnist and answers reader questions on personal finance and tax topics.

    "body": "In the running debate between actively managed funds versus simply investing in a fund that tracks the S&P 500, the scorecard continues to tilt toward the broad stock market index.\n\nAccording to data from Morningstar Direct, just 18.2% of actively managed funds whose primary prospectus benchmark is the S&P 500 managed to outperform the index in the first half of this year.\n\nThat's on track to be worse than last year, when only 19.8% of actively managed funds beat the S&P 500.\n\nOf course, some years are better for fund managers than others. In 2022, when the Federal Reserve launched its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in decades and sent the S&P 500 tumbling, 63.3% of active funds outperformed. In 2014, only 14.2% did.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the average share of active funds that beat the S&P 500 was 27%, setting up 2024 to be an especially weak year.\n\nData from Morningstar Direct also shows that 13.4% of passively managed funds are outperforming so far this year. And over the past decade, passive funds consistently trailed active funds in the share that beat the S&P 500.\n\nBut that's not surprising given that many passive funds are only looking to keep pace with the index and maintain lower expenses rather than charge higher fees and hope that they get bigger returns.\n\nTo be sure, the vast majority of the S&P 500's recent gains have come from just a handful of tech giants. That leaves index investors vulnerable to a selloff in one stock like Nvidia. Still, even as Nvidia has come well off its highs over the past few weeks, the index has continued to hit fresh records as other stocks climbed.\n\nMeanwhile, separate data showed that the S&P 500 beat three out of every four exchange-traded funds in the past year, the worst showing for ETFs since at least 2010.\n\nIn addition, funds that are diversified across asset classes and geographies also fared worse than the S&P 500. Such portfolios have lagged the index in 13 of the last 15 years, according to data from Cambria Funds cited by Bloomberg. Other data showed that out of 370 asset-allocation funds tracked by Morningstar, just one has beaten the index since 2009.\n\n\u201cIn a low-volatility, high-return environment like 2024, investors should stick to the basics \u2014 buying uncomplicated index funds, and active mutual funds with a proven track record of delivering alpha,\u201d Evercore strategist Julian Emanuel told Bloomberg last month. \u201cNo need to complicate strategy. In simplicity there is beauty.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "Better Chip Stock: AMD vs. Micron",
    "body": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Micron Technologies (NASDAQ: MU) are both underdogs in their respective markets. AMD is the world's second-largest maker of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs after Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), respectively. Micron is the world's third-largest producer of DRAM chips and its fourth-largest supplier of NAND chips. Samsung and SK Hynix lead both the DRAM and NAND markets.\n\nYet AMD and Micron both have unique competitive advantages.\n\nAMD, by outsourcing its production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, sells denser, cheaper, and more power-efficient CPUs than Intel. It also sells cheaper GPUs than Nvidia. Micron, which operates its own foundries, produces denser memory chips than its South Korean competitors.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThose strengths enabled both chipmakers to weather tough macro, cyclical, and competitive headwinds. Over the past 10 years, AMD's stock price soared 3,770% as it gained ground against Intel in x86 CPUs, kept pace with Nvidia in discrete GPUs, and carved out a defensible niche with its custom APUs for gaming consoles.\n\nMicron's stock rallied more than 300% as the expansion of the mobile, data center, PC, and connected vehicle markets generated cyclical but steady demand for its DRAM and NAND chips. AMD has clearly been the more exciting play for growth-oriented investors, but is it still the better buy right now? Let's take a fresh look at both companies to decide.\n\nBoth companies face cyclical headwinds\n\nIn 2023, AMD generated 29% of its revenue from its sales of Epyc CPUs and Instinct GPUs for data centers. It generated another 27% of its sales from gaming GPUs for PCs and custom APUs for consoles, 23% from its sales of embedded chips (including Xilinx's programmable chips), and the remaining 21% from x86 CPUs for PCs.\n\nAMD's revenue fell 4% for the year as its declining sales of PC and gaming chips offset its stronger sales of data center and embedded chips for the growing AI market. Its sales of PC CPUs and GPUs declined as fewer people upgraded their PCs following the industry's temporary growth spurt during the pandemic, and its sales of custom APUs slipped as Sony and Microsoft sold fewer consoles. Inflationary headwinds for consumer spending exacerbated that slowdown.\n\nAs a result, AMD's adjusted gross margin shrank two percentage points to 50% in 2023 as its adjusted earnings plunged 24%. But for 2024, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 5% and 23%, respectively, as it ships more data center chips for the booming AI market and the PC and gaming markets stabilize. For 2025, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to increase 28% and 60%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fiscal 2023 (which ended last August), Micron's revenue plummeted 49%, its adjusted gross margin turned negative, and it posted an adjusted net loss. Its sales of DRAM chips (71% of its top line) and NAND chips (27%) shriveled as PC shipments fizzled out and the 5G upgrade cycle for smartphones ended. The macro headwinds also drove its data customers to prioritize AI-oriented purchases of GPUs over new memory chips.\n\nBut in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Micron's revenue surged 51% year over year as the PC and smartphone markets stabilized, and data centers upgraded their solid-state drives (SSDs) and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to process more AI tasks. Its adjusted gross margin and adjusted earnings also turned positive again.\n\nFor the full year, analysts expect Micron's revenue to grow 50% with an adjusted profit. For fiscal 2025, they expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to increase by 54% and 676%, respectively, as a new growth cycle begins.\n\nBut one stock seems to be the better value\n\nAMD and Micron should both experience accelerating growth over the next two years as their core markets warm up again. However, AMD looks a bit pricey at 48 times forward earnings -- especially when Nvidia, which is growing faster with more exposure to the AI market -- has a forward multiple of 49. Micron trades at just 16 times forward earnings.\n\nAMD's valuations seem to be inflated by the market's high expectations for its Instinct GPUs -- which cost much less than Nvidia's H100 GPUs -- for the AI-driven data center market. But AMD only generates a sliver of its revenue from those chips and is highly exposed to the wobblier PC and gaming console markets.\n\nInvestors also seem bullish on Micron's growth potential in the AI market -- but its cyclical recovery is clearer and it looks more reasonably valued. That's why I believe the memory chipmaker is a better buy than AMD right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "1 Magnificent Stock That Turned $10,000 Into $454,000",
    "body": "In the past 20 years, the S&P 500 has produced a total return of 619% (as of July 2). This means that a $10,000 investment would've turned into $72,000 today. That's a great return.\n\nBut there's one stock that has drastically outperformed the broader index. The business I'm talking about has nothing to do with the internet or artificial intelligence, which is a shocker.\n\nThis magnificent stock has generated a fantastic 4,440% return in the past two decades. That $10,000 initial investment would be worth a jaw-dropping $454,000 today. Continue reading to learn more about this successful company.\n\nBoring is beautiful\n\nInvestors need to get familiar with O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY). This is a boring aftermarket auto-parts retailer, with 6,131 stores scattered across the U.S. (with a small presence in Canada and Mexico) that has put up exciting returns for its investors over the years. There are a few reasons why this is a wonderful business.\n\nFor starters, O'Reilly faces minimal threats to disruption. It targets consumers whose cars are past their original manufacturer's warranty, which is a massive pool of vehicles nationwide. The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) might be a risk to be mindful of, but there's a long way from now to a time when these cars will be dominating our roads. For the time being, O'Reilly should continue benefiting from the growing age of vehicles and the increasing number of miles driven each year.\n\nThe company's financials are superb. Growth has been steady. Revenue of $15.8 billion in 2023 was 66% higher than five years earlier. Perhaps more impressive, O'Reilly reported strong above-normal, double-digit, same-store sales growth throughout the depths of the pandemic.\n\nGenerating profits seems effortless. In the last decade, O'Reilly's operating margin has averaged 19.8%. Given the non-discretionary nature of some of the products the company sells, there could be some pricing power that management takes advantage of from time to time.\n\nThere are few businesses that help their shareholders sleep well at night more so than O'Reilly. That's because it experiences durable demand regardless of the macroclimate.\n\nIn recessionary periods, consumers might hold off buying a new car. Instead, they'll invest in the parts and supplies to keep their existing vehicles running and in good condition.\n\nAnd during a robust economic backdrop, with low unemployment and heightened consumer confidence, people will likely drive more. This increases the wear and tear on their cars. In both of these scenarios, demand for O'Reilly is healthy. This is what has been the case historically.\n\nStory continues\n\nLook at the valuation\n\nAs of this writing, shares of O'Reilly trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.3. This doesn't scream bargain. It's more expensive than the S&P 500's P/E multiple of 24.1. And it represents an 11% premium to the stock's trailing-10-year average. I don't think O'Reilly is a secret. The market is fully aware of just how outstanding a business this is.\n\nHowever, it might still be smart to buy the stock. According to Wall Street consensus-analyst estimates, revenue and earnings per share (EPS) are expected to rise at compound annual rates of 6.3% and 10.9%, respectively, between 2023 and 2026. While it's always a good idea to take forecasts with a grain of salt due to the predictable nature of this business, these estimates could be reasonable. Seeing the bottom line grow double digits would be great.\n\nPast results don't guarantee future returns, but O'Reilly is a proven compounding machine that has provided superior returns for patient shareholders. You could argue that the shares are fully valued right now, but the price could be worth it to own a proven winner with minimal risk.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in O'Reilly Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in O'Reilly Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and O'Reilly Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

It looks like there's difficulty for the digital asset to break out and start marching toward a new record.\n\nAnd as of the afternoon of July 5, Bitcoin trades around $56,500, or about 23% off its peak price. Here's why investors should add the world's top cryptocurrency to their portfolio while it's less than $60,000.\n\nFocus on the near term\n\nAs an asset that's only about 15 years old, the digital coin is still achieving certain milestones on its path to development. This January, the Securities and Exchange Commission finally approved the trading of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a monumental moment in the crypto's history.\n\nFrom the date of approval to today, its price has jumped 24%. Money is still flowing into these ETFs. With the greater accessibility and convenience that the funds provide, I think it's reasonable to assume that larger pools of capital -- from pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, for example -- will move some money to Bitcoin over time.\n\nIn April, Bitcoin underwent a halving, which cuts the new supply available to miners by half. This event happens roughly every four years, and it has typically resulted in a major bull run for the crypto in the 12 to 18 months after. With demand rising for an asset whose inflation rate has just declined, it makes sense that the price should go up.\n\nAnd there's another potential near-term catalyst on the horizon. Although inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, there is hope that interest rates will start to come down sooner rather than later. When this happens, investors are incentivized to take on more risk in order to generate a higher return on their assets, which could lead to more capital finding its way to Bitcoin.\n\nFocus on the long term\n\nZooming out and focusing on the big picture, there are other reasons to be optimistic about its potential. For starters, there are numerous companies, most notably Block, that are working on developing tools and services to help with Bitcoin's adoption. This could mean creating user-friendly physical wallets for blockchain assets or launching new payment mechanisms that use the crypto.\n\nI also think it's important to consider how changing demographics can affect Bitcoin for the better. Gen-Zers -- defined as those between ages 12 and 27 -- are more likely to own crypto than stocks, according to a survey conducted by the online insurance seller Policygenius last October. In a world that is only becoming increasingly digital, it makes sense for people to want to own something like the leading cryptocurrency as a store of value when they might feel it serves them better than the traditional financial system.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in circulation. By having this fixed limit, the digital currency is scarcer than gold. And it's portable, divisible, and functional in transactions. It could be easy to believe that it's a superior asset to gold.\n\nThe value of all the gold in the world is estimated to be $15.9 trillion. As a conservative assumption, let's say that Bitcoin's market cap gets to half that level, or about $8 trillion. At that point, each Bitcoin would be worth roughly $380,000. This implies an impressive nearly sixfold gain from today's market cap. If it takes a decade to get there, investors are looking at a theoretical 21% annualized gain in the price of the digital asset.\n\nWith Bitcoin trading well below the $60,000 level, I think investors would be wise to consider buying with the intention of holding the crypto for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Bitcoin wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "3 High-Yield Dividend ETFs to Buy to Generate Passive Income",
    "body": "Passive often isn't viewed as a positive quality. When used to describe an individual, it implies the person sits back and lets things happen to them -- frequently bad things.\n\nBut passive income is a different story altogether. An investor with great sources of passive income sits back and lets good things happen, namely allowing money to flow in regularly.\n\nWhat are some great sources of passive income? I think exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a smart place to look. Here are three high-yield dividend ETFs to buy to generate passive income (listed alphabetically).\n\n1. Investco S&P SmallCap High Dividend Low Volatility ETF\n\nThe Invesco S&P SmallCap High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEMKT: XSHD) managed by Invesco pays a sky-high 30-day SEC yield of 7.72%. This yield, by the way, reflects the net investment income per share less expenses over the previous 30 days divided by the current maximum offering price. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) developed it as a way for investors to compare funds.\n\nAs the ETF's name hints, it focuses on small-cap stocks with high dividend yields but relatively low volatility over the past 12 months. The Invesco ETF owns 57 stocks. Its top holdings include Highwoods Properties, Organon, Armour Residential REIT, Two Harbors Investment Corp, and Ellington Financial.\n\nIncome investors will probably like that the Investco S&P SmallCap High Dividend Low Volatility ETF pays distributions monthly. They might also like the fund's manageable annual expense ratio of 0.3%.\n\nWhat's not to like? Despite generating great income, the fund hasn't performed very well historically. Since its inception in December 2016, this Investco ETF's average annual return is -1.17%.\n\n2. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF\n\nThe JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEMKT: JEPI) managed by JPMorgan Chase isn't too far behind the Invest ETF in generating passive income. This fund's 30-day SEC yield stood at 7.55% as of May 31, 2024.\n\nThis ETF uses a proprietary process to select stocks with less volatility that may or may not pay dividends. It sells out-of-the-money S&P 500 index call options to generate income. Like the Investco ETF, the JPMorgan ETF makes monthly distributions.\n\nThe JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF currently owns 133 stocks. Its top holdings include Microsoft), Amazon, Progressive, Meta Platforms, and Trane Technologies.\n\nThis ETF has an annual expense ratio of 0.35%. Its performance has been strong with an average annual return of 12.57% since its inception in May 2020. Arguably the main knock against the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF is that it hasn't been around very long.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF\n\nThe SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT: SPYD) is managed by State Street. It offers a 30-day SEC yield of 4.68%.\n\nIts name gives away the ETF's focus. The SPDR ETF invests in stocks in the S&P 500 index with high dividend yields. The fund owns 75 stocks with top holdings including Iron Mountain, Public Service Enterprise Group, Williams Companies, International Paper, and Hasbro.\n\nOne big plus for this ETF is its low cost. The fund's annual expense ratio is only 0.07%. The SPDR ETF has also performed relatively well historically with an average annual return of nearly 8.6% since its inception in October 2015.\n\nUnlike the Invesco and JPMorgan ETFs, the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF pays distributions quarterly instead of monthly. However, the combination of the fund's juicy yield, low cost, and track record of positive returns could make it a good pick for investors seeking passive income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SPDR Series Trust - SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SPDR Series Trust - SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SPDR Series Trust - SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Amazon Is Now the Best-Performing Stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average In 2024. Is It a Buy Around Its All-Time High?",
    "body": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average in late February -- giving the traditionally stodgy, income-oriented index more exposure to growth.\n\nAmazon has continued its torrid run since 2023. As of June 27, it is the best-performing stock in the index.\n\nHere's why Amazon continues to climb higher and whether the growth stock is worth buying around its all-time high.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon is gushing cash\n\nBefore changing its name to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), Google was named after its flagship search engine. But YouTube is arguably Alphabet's crown jewel. Facebook was named after its flagship social media app, but then changed its name to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Instagram is arguably more valuable than Facebook today. Similarly, Amazon is named after its only retail outlet, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) is where much of the value lies.\n\nAWS is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure. According to HG Insights 2023 Infrastructure as a Service Market Report, AWS had a 50.1% market share among the top 10 cloud providers and the highest year-over-year customer count growth at 31%. AWS has been tapping into start-ups, with 86% of AWS customers spending less than $1,000 a month on AWS services -- according to HG Insights.\n\nThe impact of AWS on the broader business is undeniable. Here's a look at Amazon's trailing-12-month (TTM) results as of the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same periods over the last five years.\n\nMetric Q1 2020 TTM Q1 2021 TTM Q1 2022 TTM Q1 2023 TTM Q1 2024 TTM North America revenue $181.09 billion $254.52 billion $284.71 billion $323.52 billion $362.29 billion North America operating income $6.06 billion $10.79 billion $2.25 billion ($381 million) $18.96 billion International revenue $77.64 billion $115.96 billion $125.9 billion $118.37 billion $134.01 billion International operating income ($2 billion) $2.37 billion ($3.46 billion) ($7.71 billion) $903 million AWS revenue $37.55 billion $48.65 billion $67.14 billion $83 billion $94.44 billion AWS operating income $10.05 billion $14.62 billion $20.89 billion $21.45 billion $28.93 billion\n\nData source: Amazon.\n\nNotice the inconsistent operating income from Amazon's North America and international segments, as well as the somewhat sluggish top-line growth. Meanwhile, AWS has been a juggernaut, with TTM operating income increasing nearly threefold in just five years.\n\nThe most impressive metric in this table is that AWS operating income has grown faster than AWS revenue, suggesting that margins are improving. Not long ago, one of the biggest red flags for Amazon's investment thesis was that AWS couldn't keep up its margins in the face of mounting competition. But the results tell a different story and are likely a reason why the stock has been crushing the market as of late.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMZN Chart\n\nA higher-quality business\n\nAmazon is notorious for reinvesting profits back into the company. So using net income-based metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio can be unhelpful. Traditionally, Amazon's go-to metric was its price-to-sales ratio, which is the value of a company compared to its revenue. In the following chart, you'll notice that Amazon's P/S ratio is higher than historical levels -- suggesting the stock is more expensive.\n\nAMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe P/S ratio can be useful when dealing with a consistent business over a period of time. But the issue with using it to evaluate Amazon is that the company is fundamentally different today than it was even two to three years ago because of the growth of AWS. That's why I think the best way to value Amazon is by looking at its P/S ratio within the context of its operating income and operating margin.\n\nAMZN Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nThis chart is perhaps the simplest way to visualize Amazon's success. Amazon's TTM operating income is nearly $100 billion, and its operating margin is at a 10-year high thanks to AWS and a rebound in its North America and international segments.\n\nPaying a 3.53 P/S ratio for a high-growth, low-margin business is one thing. But that same ratio for a company growing its top line and expanding margins is entirely different.\n\nThe biggest bull case for Amazon is that it is within striking distance of its historical P/S ratio, but the quality of the business is vastly improved, and it is on a path toward consistent profitability. After all, analyst consensus estimates call for $4.55 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $5.78 in 2025 EPS -- giving Amazon a 34.1 P/E based on 2025 estimated earnings. That's not a sky-high valuation -- especially when considering the stock is up 130% in 18 months.\n\nAmazon is stretched thin but is still a good buy\n\nAmazon is at the top of its game, but its stock chart reflects that. Warren Buffett once said, \"You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.\" In other words, consensus positivity toward a company usually results in an expensive stock price, just as an out-of-favor stock can be quite cheap.\n\nLess than two years ago, Amazon was under immense pressure due to slowing growth and recession fears. It was the opposite of a cheery consensus. Today, Amazon is, once again, a darling. But the long-term investment thesis has also gotten stronger as AWS continues to be a high-margin growth engine that can fuel the company's other exploits.\n\nAll told, Amazon is a decent buy, but it is no longer the no-brainer buy it was before. It still must grow into its valuation and prove its higher margins aren't a one-off. If growth slows, expect Amazon to be under pressure.\n\nThe higher a stock runs up in the short term, the more its valuation gets stretched. But over the long term, Amazon certainly has the trajectory needed to compound earnings and benefit patient investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "body": "Get ahead of the market by subscribing to Seeking Alpha's Stocks to Watch, a preview of key events scheduled for the coming week. The newsletter keeps you informed of the biggest stories set to make headlines, including upcoming IPOs, investor days, earnings reports and conference presentations.\n\nThe major focus of the markets for the first full week of the third quarter will be the June CPI report and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony to committees in the Senate and House. The CPI print is forecast to show a 0.1% month-over-month rise in inflation, while the annual core inflation rate is expected to be unchanged at 3.4%. Bank of America expects the June CPI report to be another confidence builder following the \"undeniably good\" May report. The firm noted that rent and owners' equivalent rent increases should cool in the coming months, which should add to the Fed's confidence in the inflation outlook. BNP Paribas highlighted that auto insurance and air fares could also trickle lower.\n\nThe earnings season officially begins with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) heading into the earnings confessional, along with major banks such as Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC). The event calendar includes Tyson Foods' (NYSE:TSN) Demo Day for startups, Samsung's (OTCPK:SSNLF) Unpacked Galaxy event, and the Allen Conference in Sun Valley. Meanwhile, the auto sector is expected to create more headlines as the battle between the European Union and Chinese electric vehicle companies ramps up and Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF) workers in South Korea threaten to strike. Tesla (TSLA) shares are also in the spotlight due to the recent spike after the company posted a better-than-feared Q2 deliveries report.\n\nEarnings spotlight: Monday, July 8 - Greenbrier (GBX). See the full earnings calendar.\n\nEarnings spotlight: Tuesday, July 9 - Helen of Troy (HELE) and Kura Sushi (KRUS). See the full earnings calendar.\n\nEarnings spotlight: Wednesday, July 10 - Manchester United (MANU) and PriceSmart (PSMT). See the full earnings calendar.\n\nEarnings spotlight: Thursday, July 11 - Delta Air Lines (DAL), PepsiCo (PEP), and Conagra Brands (CAG). See the full earnings calendar.\n\nEarnings spotlight: Friday, July 12 - Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), and Wells Fargo (WFC). See the full earnings calendar.\n\nVolatility watch: Options trading volume is elevated on Faraday Future Intelligent (FFIE) and Conn's (CONN). The most overbought stocks per their 14-day relative strength index include Spectral Capital (OTCPK:FCCN), Bio Essence (OTCPK:BIOE), and Simply Better Brands (OTCQB:SBBCF). The most oversold stocks per their 14-day Relative Strength Index include Thunder Power (AIEV), SolarEdge (SEDG), and Sonoco (SON). Short interest is high on Hertz Global (HTZ), Carvana (CVNA), and Cinemark Holdings (CNK) heading into next week's action\n\nIPO watch: There are no new IPOs expected to begin trading during the week. The IPO lockup period expires on a block of shares of Smith Douglas Homes (SDHC). The quiet period expires on Tempus AI (NASDAQ:TEM) to free up analysts to post ratings. At the time of publication, Tempus AI traded about 15% below where the IPO was priced.\n\nDividend watch: Companies that have an ex-dividend date coming next week include JPMorgan (JPM) and Progressive (PGR). The five stocks in the S&P 500 Index with the highest dividend yields are Ford Motor (F), Amcor (AMCR), Hasbro (HAS), Best Buy (BBY), and International Paper (IP). Read through some of the dividend stock picks from Seeking Alpha analysts.\n\nDelta Air Lines earnings preview: Delta Air Lines (DAL) is due to report earnings on July 11. The airline company is looking to build off its strong financial results for Q1, when it delivered record revenue and earnings at the high end of its guidance. Heading into the report, Delta (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian has noted that demand for air travel remains strong, with the customer base in a healthy financial position and travel being a top priority. In general, Delta (DAL) continues to benefit from a premium consumer mix as a best-in-class operator, with diversified revenue and cash streams. Analysts are looking for Delta (DAL) to reiterate its 2024 guidance for EPS of $6.00 to $7.00 and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. A positive or negative surprise from Delta (DAL) with its guidance update could be a share price catalyst for the airline sector in general. Options trading implies a share price swing of 6% after Delta's (DAL) report is dropped. Shares of Delta (DAL) fell 2.3% after the company's last earnings report. United Airlines (UAL), Copa Holdings (CPA), and Alaska Air (ALK) are the three airline stocks that correlate the closest to Delta after its earnings report is released.\n\nPepsiCo earnings preview: PepsiCo (PEP) will report Q2 earnings on July 11. Consensus estimates from analysts are for revenue of $22.7 billion to be disclosed, EPS of $2.16, adjusted operating margin of 17.6%, and adjusted EBITDA of $4.72 billion. Organic sales are seen rising by 3.0%, led by a strong performance in the Europe and Latin America regions. Volume is seen as being up 4.1% to offset a 1.1% decline in pricing. UBS noted that although the stock has largely traded sideways to start the year and the firm's crowding analysis points to PepsiCo being a crowded long, conversations would suggest sentiment remains negative heading into results due to concerns about challenging U.S. trends. \"We do not expect 2Q results to represent a meaningful positive catalyst, with many investors taking a wait-and-see approach whether top- and bottom-line trends can show improvement. However, longer-term, we see a path to improved performance from here, and view the current entry point as attractive,\" updated the UBS analyst team. On Seeking Alpha, Empyrean Research is also cautious on PepsiCo (PEP) due in part to the continued overhang of GLP-1 and Russia risks.\n\nInvestor events: The five-day Allen Conference will take place in Sun Valley, Idaho, next week. The list of heavy-hitter invitees includes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon (AMZN) Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Salesforce (CRM) Marc Benioff, Uber Technologies (UBER) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav, and Airbnb (ABNB) CEO Brian Chesky. Some analysts think this year's media mogul confab will generate more headlines than has been seen recently. The three-day SEMICON West conference will also take place. The event showcases the latest advancements in the microelectronics sector, covering electronic design automation, device fabrication, and final manufacturing, including assembly, packaging, and testing. Meanwhile, Samsung's (OTCPK:SSNLF) next Galaxy Unpacked event will take place in Paris. Industry watchers expect to see new foldables and smartwatches unveiled, as well as the arrival of the Galaxy Ring smart ring. Also on the calendar, Tyson Foods (TSN) will hold its Demo Day 2024. The event offers startups an exclusive platform for potential partnership opportunities with Tyson. Selected startups could receive mentorship from Tyson Foods executives, access to pilot and testing programs, possible proof of concepts, and the potential for commercial partnerships. Other notable investor events include Chewy's (CHWY) annual meeting and Axcelis Technologies' (NASDAQ:ACLS) Investor Day.",

    "title": "5 Relatively Secure And Cheap Dividend Stocks To Invest In - July 2024",
    "body": "Olivier Le Moal\n\nAuthor's Note: This is our monthly series on Dividend Stocks, usually published in the first week of every month. We scan the universe of roughly 7,500 stocks listed and traded on U.S. exchanges and use our proprietary filtering criteria to select five relatively safe stocks that may be trading cheaper compared to their historical valuations. Some of the sections in the article, like \"Selection Process/Methodology,\" are repeated each month with few changes. This is intentional as well as unavoidable, as this is necessary for the new readers to be able to conceptualize the process. Regular readers of this series could skip such sections to avoid repetitiveness.\n\n************\n\nMarkets are always unpredictable. However, to be a successful investor, fortunately, we do not need to know exactly where the market is going. We believe it is not possible to catch the exact bottom (or the peak), so it is best to invest regularly and consistently in good, solid dividend-paying stocks when their valuations are attractive. Against this backdrop, keeping some cash reserves and dry powder ready to deal with any scenario is important.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThe main goal of this series of articles is to shortlist and highlight companies that have a solid history of paying and raising dividends. In addition, we demand that these companies support strong fundamentals, carry low debt, and are offered at a relatively cheaper valuation. These DGI stocks are not going to make anyone rich overnight, but if your goal is to attain financial freedom by owning stocks that would grow dividends over time, meaningfully and sustainably, then you are at the right place. These lists are not necessarily recommendations to buy but a shortlist of probable candidates for further research. The purpose is to keep our buy list handy and dry powder ready so we can use the opportunity when the time is right. Besides, every month, this analysis is able to highlight a few companies that otherwise would not be on our radar.\n\nEvery month, we start with roughly 7,500 stocks that are listed and traded on U.S. exchanges, including over-the-counter (OTC) networks. Using our filtering criteria, the initial list is quickly narrowed to roughly 700 stocks, mostly dividend-paying and dividend-growing. From thereon, by using various data elements, including dividend history, payout ratios, revenue growth, debt ratios, EPS growth, etc., we calculate a \"Dividend Quality Score\" for each stock that measures the relative safety and sustainability of the dividend. In addition to dividend safety, we also seek cheaper valuations. We also demand that the selected companies have an established business model, solid dividend history, manageable debt, and an investment-grade credit rating.\n\nThis month, we highlight three groups with five stocks each that have an average dividend yield (as a group) of 3.61%, 5.30%, and 7.78%, respectively. The first list is for conservative and risk-averse investors, while the second is for investors seeking higher yields but still wanting relatively safe dividends. The third group is for yield-hungry investors but comes with an elevated risk, and we urge investors to exercise caution.\n\nNotes: 1) Please note that when we use the term \"safe\" in relation to stocks and investments, it should be interpreted as \"relatively safe\" because nothing is absolutely safe in investing. Even though we present only 5 to 10 stocks in our final list, one should have 15-20 stocks at a minimum in a well-diversified portfolio.\n\n2) All tables in this article are created by the author unless explicitly specified. The stock data have been sourced from various sources such as Seeking Alpha, Yahoo Finance, GuruFocus, Morningstar, and CCC-List (Dividend Radar).\n\nThe Selection Process\n\nNote: Regular readers of this series could skip this section to avoid repetitiveness. We include this section (in part) for new readers to provide the necessary background and perspective. Readers can also read a more detailed explanation of the goals and the selection process in our blog post here.\n\nCriteria to Shortlist:\n\nMarket cap > $10 billion ($8 billion in a down market)\n\nDividend yield > 1.0% (some exceptions are made to include high quality but lower yielding companies)\n\nDaily average volume > 100,000\n\nDividend growth past five years >= 0.\n\nBy applying the above criteria, we got around 600 companies.\n\nNarrowing Down the List\n\nAs a first step, we would like to eliminate stocks that have less than five years of dividend growth history. We cross-check our current list of over 600 stocks against the list of so-called Dividend Champions, Contenders, and Challengers originally defined and created by David Fish. Generally, the stocks with more than 25 years of dividend increases are called dividend Champions, while stocks with more than ten but less than 25 years of dividend increases are termed Contenders. Further, stocks with more than five but less than ten years of dividend increases are called Challengers. Also, since we want a lot of flexibility and wider choice at this initial stage, we include some companies that pay dividends lower than 1.40% but otherwise have a stellar dividend record and growing dividends at a fast pace.\n\nAfter we apply all the above criteria, we're left with 364 companies on our list. However, so far in this list, we have demanded five or more years of consistent dividend growth. But what if a company had a very stable record of dividend payments but did not increase the dividends from one year to another? At times, some of these companies are foreign-based companies, and due to currency fluctuations, their dividends may appear to have been cut in US dollars, but in reality, that may not be true at all when looked at in the actual currency of reporting. At times, we may provide some exceptions when a company may have cut the dividend in the past, but otherwise, it looks compelling. So, by relaxing some of the conditions, a total of 70 additional companies were considered to be on our list. We call them category 'B' companies. After including them, we had a total of 434 (364 + 70) companies that made our first list.\n\nWe then imported the various data elements from many sources and assigned weights based on different criteria as listed below:\n\nCurrent yield: Indicates the yield based on the current price.\n\nDividend growth history (number of years of dividend growth): This provides information on how many years a company has paid and increased dividends on a consistent basis. For stocks under the category 'B' (defined above), we consider the total number of consecutive years of dividends paid rather than the number of years of dividend growth.\n\nPayout ratio: This indicates how comfortably the company can pay the dividend from its earnings. We prefer this ratio to be as low as possible, which would indicate the company's ability to grow the dividend in the future. This ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend amount per share by the EPS (earnings per share). The cash-flow payout ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend amount paid per share by the cash flow generated per share.\n\nPast five-year and 10-year dividend growth: Even though it's the dividend growth rate from the past, this does indicate how fast the company has been able to grow its earnings and dividends in the recent past. The recent past is the best indicator that we have to know what to expect in the next few years.\n\nEPS growth (average of previous five years of growth and expected next five years' growth): As the earnings of a company grow, more than likely, dividends will grow accordingly. We will take into account the actual EPS growth of the previous five years and the estimated EPS growth for the next five years. We will add the two numbers and assign weights.\n\nChowder number: So, what's the Chowder number? This number has been named after well-known SA author Chowder, who first coined and popularized this factor. This number is derived by adding the current yield and the past five years' dividend growth rate. A Chowder number of \"12\" or more (\"8\" for utilities) is considered good.\n\nDebt/equity ratio: This ratio will tell us about the company's debt load in relation to its equity. We all know that too much debt can lead to major problems, even for well-known companies. The lower this ratio, the better it is. Sometimes, we find this ratio to be negative or unavailable, even for well-known companies. This can happen for a myriad of reasons and is not always a reason for concern. This is why we use this ratio in combination with the debt/asset ratio (covered next).\n\nDebt/asset ratio: This ratio will tell us about the debt load in relation to the company's total assets. In almost all cases, this ratio would be lower than the debt/equity ratio. Also, this ratio is important because, for some companies, the debt/equity ratio is not a reliable indicator.\n\nS&P's credit rating: This is the credit rating assigned by the rating agency S&P Global and is indicative of the company's ability to service its debt. This rating can be obtained from the S&P website.\n\nPEG ratio: This is also called the price/earnings-to-growth ratio. The PEG ratio is considered to be an indicator if the stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced. A lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued. However, PEG for a company may differ significantly from one reported source to another, depending on which growth estimate is used in the calculation. Some use past growth, while others may use future expected growth.\n\nDistance from 52-week high: We want to select companies that are good, solid companies but also are trading at cheaper valuations currently. They may be cheaper due to some temporary down cycle or some combination of bad news or simply having a bad quarter. This criterion will help bring such companies (with a cheaper valuation) near the top as long as they excel in other criteria as well. This factor is calculated as (current price - 52-week high) / 52-week high.\n\nSales or Revenue growth: This is the average growth rate in annual sales or revenue of the company over the last five years. A company can only grow its earnings power as long as it can grow its revenue. Sure, it can grow the earnings by cutting costs, but that can't go on forever.\n\nDownloadable Dataset:\n\nBelow, we provide a link to the table with relevant data on nearly 400 stocks. Readers can download this table for further analysis. Please note that the table is sorted by \"Total Weight\" or \"Initial Quality Score.\"\n\nFile-for-export-5_Secure_DGI_-_July_2024.xlsx\n\nSelection Of The Top 50\n\nWe will first bring down the list (of about 400) to roughly 50 names by automated criteria, as listed below. In the second step, which is mostly manual and subjective, we will bring the list down to about 15.\n\nStep 1: First, take the top 20 names from the above table (based on total weight or quality score). At times, some industry segments tend to get overcrowded at the top, so we take the top two (or three) and ignore the rest.\n\nStep 2: As a second step, we will take the top 10 names based on the highest dividend yield. When it comes to dividend yield, some of the industry segments tend to be overcrowded. So, we will take the top two (or a maximum of three) names from any single industry segment. We take the top 10 stocks after the sort to the final list.\n\nStep 3: Now, we will sort our list based on five-year dividend growth (highest at the top) and select the top 10 names.\n\nStep 4: Not all companies have a 10-year streak of dividend growth, but many do. We will sort our list based on 10-year dividend growth (highest at the top) and select the top 10 names.\n\nStep 5: We also want to give priority to stocks that are rated highest in terms of credit rating. So, we will sort the list based on the numerical weight of the credit rating and select the top 10 stocks with the best credit rating. Again, we are careful not to have too many names from the same sector.\n\nStep 6: Lastly, as the name of the series suggests, we want to have some names that may be trading cheaper in comparison to their historical valuation. So, we select the top ten names with the highest discount. However, they could be trading cheap for just the wrong reasons, so we need to be careful that they meet our other quality criteria.\n\nFrom the above steps, we now have a total of 70 names in our final consideration. However, the following stocks appeared more than once:\n\nStocks that appeared two times: ADP, CI, DHI, GFI, MSFT, TSM, V, VOYA (8 duplicates)\n\nStock that appeared 3 times: NKE (2 duplicates).\n\nAfter removing ten duplicates, we are left with 60 (70-10) names.\n\nSince there are multiple names in each industry segment, we will keep a maximum of two or three names (from the top) from any one segment. Also, if the dividend yield was too low (< 0.75%), we would rather remove them at this stage unless the growth potential is extraordinary. After some pruning, we are left with 50 names. The top names from each sector/industry segment are presented:\n\nFinancial Services, Banking, and Insurance:\n\nBanks - Regional:\n\nBanks - Major: (JPM), (BNS)\n\nFinancial Services - Others: (MS), (VOYA), (ARCC)\n\nSecurity & Exchanges \u2013\n\nAsset Management/ Inv Bank \u2013 (RJF)\n\nInsurance: (OTCQX:ZURVY)\n\nBusiness Services/ Consulting:\n\n(V), (ADP)\n\nConglomerates:\n\n(CSL)\n\nIndustrials:\n\n(PH), (AGCO), (ALLE)\n\nTransportation/ Logistics:\n\nChemicals:\n\n(FMC)\n\nMaterials/Mining/Gold:\n\nMaterials - others: (MOS)\n\nMining (other than Gold): (RIO)\n\nGold: (GFI)\n\nDefense:\n\nNone\n\nConsumer/Retail/Others:\n\nCons-Staples: (PEP), (ADM), (PG)\n\nCons-discretionary: (NKE), (SIRI)\n\nCons-Retail: (TGT), (DKS)\n\nTobacco: (BTI)\n\nCommunications/Media\n\n(VZ), (BCE)\n\nHealthcare:\n\nPharma: (JNJ), (BMY), (SNY)\n\nHealthcare Ins: (CI)\n\nHealthcare Services:\n\nTechnology:\n\n(MSFT), (TSM), (AVGO), (NXPI)\n\nEnergy:\n\nPipelines/ Midstream: (MPLX), (ENB)\n\nOil & Gas (prod. & exploration): (EOG), (OVV)\n\nEnergy Majors: (CVX)\n\nUtilities:\n\n(NEE), (NRG)\n\nHousing/ Construction:\n\nHome Building: (DHI), (LEN),\n\nBuilding Material:\n\nConstruction & Engg: (PWR)\n\nREIT:\n\n(CCI), (GLPI).\n\nFinal Step: Narrowing Down To Just Five Companies\n\nIn this step, we construct three separate lists of five stocks each, with different sets of goals, dividend income, and risk levels.\n\nThe lists are:\n\n1) Relatively Safe (Low-yield) Dividend list,\n\n2) Moderately High Dividend List,\n\n3) Ultra High Dividend List, and\n\n4) A combined list of the above three (duplicates removed).\n\nOut of the top 50, we make our judgment calls to make these three lists, so basically, the selections are based on our research and perceptions. So, while most of the filtering until now was based on automated criteria, the last step is pretty much subjective. We try to make each of the three lists highly diversified among various sectors and industry segments and try to ensure that the safety of dividends matches the overall risk profile of the group. We certainly encourage readers to do further research on the highlighted names.\n\nNonetheless, here are our three final lists for this month:\n\nFinal A-List (Relatively Safe Income):\n\nAverage yield: 3.61%\n\nTable-1A: A-LIST (Conservative Income)\n\nAuthor\n\nWe think this set of five companies (in the A-List) would form a solid, diversified group of dividend companies that would be appealing to income-seeking and conservative investors, including retirees and near-retirees. The average yield is 3.61%, which is nearly 2.75x of what the S&P 500 pays. The average dividend history is nearly 34 years. Also, all five companies have an investment grade credit rating, and four out of five have an excellent rating of AA- or higher. If you must need higher dividends, consider B-List or C-List, presented later.\n\nMSFT (Microsoft):\n\nMSFT is a technology behemoth that needs no introduction. It is part of the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' in the S&P500. It has paid and raised dividend payouts for the last 22 years and is only a few years away from being a dividend aristocrat. It has had tremendous growth in its share price since 2014, and there seems to be no let-up in its upward trajectory. Most recently, in 2023, it has led the AI wave from a position of strength, as it owns a major stake in ChatGPT maker OpenAI (thanks to its $10 billion investment in OpenAI). In fact, its AI Services are expected to contribute significantly to its Azure cloud growth in the future. Microsoft is likely to continue leading in the Cloud and AI space. All that said, the stock price is not cheap, and the dividend yield is quite low despite 10% plus growth in payouts for the last ten years. We are including it in the A-List for its growth prospects, stellar credit rating, and stable and growing dividends.\n\nADP (Automatic Data Processing):\n\nADP has paid and grown its dividend payout for the last 49 years and is known for the reliability and growth of its dividends at a steady pace. It is only a year away from becoming a Dividend-King. Even though its current yield is mediocre, relatively high growth should compensate in the long run. Currently, the shares are not particularly cheap and are hovering near their 52-week high. We are still including it in the A-list for its exceptional record of growing dividends and growth and excellent credit rating.\n\nPEP (PepsiCo):\n\nPepsiCo is an iconic American company that operates around the globe. It owns well-known household brands, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lay's, Cheetos, and Doritos, among others. The company is the second-largest beverage company behind Coca-Cola, and beverages account for nearly 45% of its revenues. The rest of the revenue is generated by Snacks and Convenience foods. The company generates nearly 40% of total sales and nearly a third of its profits outside the US.\n\nBesides, last year, PepsiCo became a Dividend-King, meaning it has increased its dividends consistently for the last 50-plus years. For dividend investors, it is quite a milestone. PepsiCo is a must-have in every DGI portfolio; however, it should be added at the right price. In our view, currently, it is trading close to its fair price, though not cheap by any means. It is yielding roughly 3.29% against a 5-year average of 2.75%. Morningstar puts the fair value close to $176 a share, which is nearly 8% above the current price. Also, it is 14% cheaper than its 52-week highs achieved in July 2023.\n\nThere are short-term headwinds for the company, which have impacted the market sentiment and drove the share price down from its recent highs in May 2024. The main reason appears to be that the consumer is maxed out due to persistent inflation and high interest rates, from car loans to credit card rates. The consumer is in no position to take any more price increases for consumer and food products. PepsiCo was able to push price increases in 2023 without impacting the volumes, but that changed in 2024. All that said, these things are cyclical and are not going to impact the company in the long term. The share price can still go down from the current levels, so it should be added in multiple lots.\n\nSNY (Sanofi):\n\nSanofi is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, based in France. It is also the largest French pharma company. Morningstar puts the fair value at $61 a share, which is nearly 19% above the current price. The company enjoys a strong balance sheet due to a rich pipeline of approved and experimental drugs. The company announced a new strategic policy in 2023, under which it would increase R&D spending and also spin-off or separate the consumer healthcare business unit. Apparently, the market and the dividend-seeking shareholders did not like the idea of increased spending, even though the proposals should benefit the long-term shareholders if the management can bring some faster growth. The company has relatively low debt (roughly $8.5 billion), a strong balance sheet, and a healthy pipeline of current and future drugs, especially in the immunology segment.\n\nThe current share price offers a good entry point and a very attractive dividend yield.\n\nENB (Enbridge):\n\nEnbridge is a midstream energy company based in Canada and serves markets both in Canada and the United States. They operate one of the longest and most complex liquids transportation networks, with over 17,000 miles of pipelines. Enbridge's natural gas pipelines connect supplies to major North American cities and population centers, as well as LNG export facilities. Another subsidiary of Enbridge, Enbridge Gas, will become one of the largest natural gas utilities in North America (after their September 2023 acquisition of Dominion\u2019s assets close in 2024). So far this year, the company has closed on two of three utility purchases/ acquisitions from Dominion Energy, while the third should be completed before the end of 2024. However, the results from these acquisitions have yet to show up in the profitability of the company. ENB's focus on utility-like businesses will likely de-risk ENB's profile. The current debt to EBITDA ratio stands at 4.7x, which is right in the middle of ENB's target of maintaining the debt to EBITDA in the range between 4.5x and 5x.\n\nThe company has paid and grown the dividend at a very respectable pace for 28 years (in Canadian dollars). The dividend payout is fully covered by the DCF (distributable cash flow). In fact, the ratio of dividends to DCF (distributable cash flow) is below 60%, thus quite conservative. Moreover, the current dividend yield, roughly 7.5%, is very attractive. All this bodes well for the investors in terms of the company's ability to continue growing its dividend for the foreseeable future, albeit at a slower pace.\n\nFinal B-List (High Yield, Moderately Safe):\n\nAverage yield: 5.30%\n\n(MSFT)\n\n(PEP)\n\n( BMY )\n\nBMY ( ARCC )\n\nARCC (ENB)\n\nNote 1: Very often, we include a few low-risk stocks in the B-list and C-list. Also, oftentimes, a stock can appear in multiple lists. This is done on purpose. We try to make each of our lists fairly diversified among different sectors/industry segments of the economy. We try to include a few of the highly conservative names in the high-yield list to make the overall group much safer.\n\nTable-1B: B-LIST (High Yield)\n\nAuthor\n\nIn the B-List, the overall risk profile of the group becomes slightly elevated compared to the A-List. That said, the group (as a whole) will likely provide safe dividends for many years. This list offers an average yield for the group of nearly 5.30%, an average of 27 years of dividend history, and an average discount of -12% (from 52-week highs).\n\nBMY (Bristol Myers Squibb Co):\n\nBristol's share price has lost nearly 50% since its peak in Dec. 2022, and currently, it appears to be undervalued. It also offers a very nice dividend yield of 5.75% at current prices. Only Pfizer is another major pharma company that offers a higher dividend yield at this time, but it also comes with higher risks. The company is facing several headwinds that include patent expirations, generic threats, decreasing pricing power owing to managed-care constraints, and product liability cases. The Celgene acquisition in 2019 added a large amount of debt to the company\u2019s balance sheet, which continues to be a financial risk. That said, the company has reduced its long-term debt by nearly 1/3rd from $48 billion in 2020 to $32 Billion in 2023.\n\nBMY is quite adept at making partnerships, deals, and acquisitions. In the process, Bristol has created a strong pipeline and has partnered with other companies to lower the development costs of the new drugs as well as diversify the risks of regulatory failure. They also have a cardiovascular partnership with Pfizer, managing the blockbuster potential of the Eliquis drug. Another recent deal is a licensing deal with SystImmune to bolster BMY's oncology pipeline, which could turn out to be worth multi-billion dollars. BMY increased its quarterly dividend payout early this year from $0.57 a share to $0.60 (a 5.26% increase). In balance, BMY is an attractive buy at the current price and, to some extent, a contrarian turn-around candidate.\n\nARCC (Ares Capital):\n\nAres Capital is one of the largest BDCs (Business Development Companies) in terms of market capitalization and net asset values. ARCC offers a very high yield of roughly 9.2%. Being a BDC, it invests in small and medium-sized companies, some of which may be distressed. ARCC has investments in nearly 500 companies, making it a very diversified portfolio. It has a record of generating a high NII (net Investment income), which currently exceeds $1 billion on an annual basis. Based on core-EPS, its payout ratio is under 81% for the last 12 months, which is respectable for a BDC. Based on the Net Investment Income, it comes out to be 85.7%. The dividend coverage stands at 1.15%. The market for BDCs is getting competitive, and the uncertainty about the interest rates makes their business more challenging, but ARCC is well-positioned to continue performing well.\n\nWith over 9% dividend yield, there is not much scope left for capital appreciation, but we must remember that this is an investment for income. That said, if someone reinvests all the dividends, the total returns may still be attractive.\n\nFinal C-LIST (Yield-Hungry, Less Safe):\n\nAverage yield: 7.78%\n\nNotes:\n\nNote 1: Oftentimes, a stock can appear in multiple lists. We try to include one or two conservative names in the high-yield list to make the overall group much safer.\n\nTable-1C: C-LIST (Yield-Hungry, Elevated Risk)\n\nAuthor\n\nNOTE: MPLX is structured as a partnership (not a corporation) and issues a K-1 tax form instead of the usual 1099-Div. Please use due diligence.\n\nBTI (British American Tobacco)\n\nSome investors may not like Tobacco stocks, and that is understandable. But if you are fine with investing in Tobacco stocks, it probably can't get better than this. The current yield is quite high at 9.5%. The company has excelled in growing the new categories of products. However, this is purely an income investment, and we should not expect any significant growth. That said, for income investors, the dividend appears to be reasonably safe. The share price has recovered somewhat from the lows earlier this year. It may be much safer to buy this stock in multiple lots using the dollar-cost-averaging. You may like to read our previous article here, which covered BTI in more detail.\n\nBCE (BCE Inc):\n\nBCE is the largest communications company in Canada. In many ways, its positives and challenges are similar to those of Verizon (VZ) in the US; however, currently, it is providing a much higher dividend yield than Verizon. BCE is currently paying a very attractive dividend yield of 8.75%. It has paid and raised the dividend payouts consecutively for 15 years (in Canadian dollar terms). It offers a wide range of telecommunications products and services, including wireless, wireline, Broadband, and TV services, to approximately 22 million subscribers in Canada. However, there are some risks that investors should be aware of. It operates in a very competitive environment, and just like other telecom companies in the industry, it carries a large debt burden of nearly $25 billion. We should not expect much growth in the share price, but with over 9% dividend, even a marginal capital appreciation would make it a reasonably good investment.\n\nMPLX (MPLX LP):\n\nWe included ENB from the energy sector in the A-List and B-List. However, to enhance the yield slightly, we are replacing ENB with MPLX in the C-List. First of all, it is a Partnership and issues a K-1 tax form (partnership income) instead of the usual 1099 in case of regular dividends.\n\nMPLX is a diversified midstream energy company structured as a master limited partnership. It was formed in 2012 by Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) for the purpose of owning, operating, acquiring, and developing midstream energy infrastructure assets. To date, MPC remains the largest unitholder of MPLX.\n\nMPLX maintains a solid balance sheet with investor-grade BBB credit rating and pays a very attractive yield, currently at 8%. It has paid and raised the dividend payout since its inception in 2012 and most recently raised the payout by 9.65% in Nov. 2023. Its dividend is well covered, and dividend coverage stands at 1.6x. Even though, in the last five years, the price appreciation has been significant, we expect limited price appreciation going forward. However, we can expect a very stable and near 8% dividend payout for the foreseeable future.\n\n===\n\nApparently, this list (C-List) is for yield-hungry DGI investors. The yield goes up as much as 7.78%. However, this list is not for conservative investors. As you can see, the average credit rating of this set of companies is much lower than the A-List or even B-List. Dividends are moderately safe in this list, but the yields are very attractive. At least a couple of companies in this list come with an elevated level of risk. We urge due diligence to determine if it would suit your personal situation. Nothing comes for free, so there will be more risk involved with this group. That said, it's a highly diversified group spread among five different industry segments.\n\nWe would like to caution that each company comes with certain risks and concerns. Sometimes, these risks are real, but other times, they may be a bit overblown and temporary. So, it's always recommended to do further research and due diligence.\n\nWhat If We Were to Combine the Three Lists?\n\nIf we combine the three lists and remove the duplicates (because of combining), we would be left with eleven names.\n\nTwo-time duplicates: ARCC, ENB, MSFT (3 duplicates).\n\nThree-time duplicates: PEP (2 duplicates).\n\nAfter removing these five duplicates, we are left with 10 names.\n\nFrom the energy sector, we have two similar names (ENB and MPLX). We keep ENB and remove MPLX (since MPLX is a partnership).\n\nWe also have two stocks from Healthcare; we keep SNY and remove BMY.\n\nThe combined list is highly diversified in as many as eight industry segments. The stats for the group of 8 are as follows:\n\nAverage yield: 5.71%\n\nAverage discount (from 52WK High): -10.4%\n\nAverage 5-yr dividend growth: 6.84%\n\nAverage 10-yr dividend growth: 8.08% (from five names)\n\nAverage Payout Ratio: 63.69%\n\nAverage Total Quality Score: 71.88\n\nTable 2:\n\nAuthor\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the first week of every month, we start with a fairly large list of dividend-paying stocks and filter our way down to just a handful of stocks that meet our selection criteria and income goals. In this article, we have presented three groups of stocks (five each) with different goals in mind to suit the varying needs of a wider audience. Even though the risk profile of each group is different, each group in itself is fairly balanced and diversified.\n\nThis month, the first group yields 3.61%, while the second group elevates the yield to 5.30%. We also presented a C-list for yield-hungry investors with a 7.78% yield. The combined group (all three lists combined with duplication removed) offers an even more diversified group with eight positions and a 5.71% yield.",

You did it for America.\n\nHere's where we're going today:\n\nMore on the potential for a resurgence in trade wars and inflation -- and how I would invest in such a scenario\n\nLagging data > lagging monetary policy > aggravated boom-bust cycle\n\nSome of the last holdouts of economic growth are capitulating and increasing the recessionary outlook\n\nLet's get into it.\n\nFollow-Up On The Tariff Threat & Potential Inflation Resurgence\n\nIn last week's article, \"8 Stocks I'm Buying As A Resurgent Trade War Looms,\" I discussed the huge body of economic research evincing the overwhelmingly net negative effects of high tariffs and trade wars.\n\nProtectionism may be politically popular, but many economic studies conducted by researchers across the political spectrum concur that tariffs and trade wars do little to protect and nurture domestic industries while greatly burdening consumers and businesses.\n\nIf the goal is to generate inflation, there are few government policies better suited to accomplishing this than raising tariffs.\n\nCNBC recently put out an excellent video explainer about the differences between Trump and Biden's trade policies, and which one would be worse for US consumers.\n\nWhile last week's article discussed both Trump and Biden's economically burdensome trade policies, this week, I'll focus on Trump's proposed tariffs, including a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imports.\n\nWhy focus on Trump? Because, according to prediction markets like PredictIt, Trump is by far the most likely candidate to win at this point.\n\nPredictIt\n\nWhile the stock market's recent rally indicates optimism about the potential for tax cuts to be extended, I'm more focused on the likely negative effects of a potentially resurgent trade war.\n\nThe trade-friendly defenders of Trump, a man who once dubbed himself \"Tariff Man\" (I would've preferred \"The Tariff Sheriff,\" but alas, I was not consulted), assert that Trump is only using tariffs as a temporary negotiating chip to get better trade deals with our international trading partners. But according to Trump's website, his goal is to \"bring back our supply chains, and build America into the manufacturing superpower of the world.\"\n\nIn other words, Trump's goal is to permanently make international trade more expensive in order to give an advantage to US manufacturing.\n\nThe idea here isn't just to tinker around the edges, incrementally improving trade deals. It is to fundamentally reshape the American economy by expanding manufacturing and punishing consumption. To the degree Trump did renegotiate new trade deals, it was toward this goal of promoting US manufacturing rather than free trade.\n\nAs proof of this, simply note that the majority of tariff increases Trump implemented remained in place throughout his term and were kept in place by President Biden.\n\nIn last week's article, I mentioned that multiple think tanks estimate Trump's proposed 10% across-the-board tariff would cost the average household between $1,500 and $1,700 per year. The center-right think tank American Action Forum adds that Trump's proposed 60% tariff on all Chinese imports would raise the annual cost to average households to $1,950 annually.\n\nAnd this does not include the impact of any retaliatory tariffs.\n\nInterestingly, if China imposed retaliatory 60% tariffs on all imports from the US, the average cost to Chinese households would be only $170 annually. But while it would cost Chinese consumers very little, it would likely cost the US many trade-supported jobs.\n\nAmerican Action Forum\n\nSounds like a pretty bad deal to me.\n\nApparently, it also sounds bad to a group of 16 Nobel prize-winning economists, who recently penned an open letter warning that Trump's trade policies, if enacted, would likely trigger a resurgence of inflation.\n\nTo be fair, these 16 economists erode some of their credibility by criticizing Trump's \"fiscally irresponsible budgets\" with no mention of Biden's equally fiscally irresponsible budgets.\n\nBut arguably the most important point they make in the letter is this:\n\nNonpartisan researchers, including at Evercore, Allianz, Oxford Economics, and the Peterson Institute, predict that if Donald Trump successfully enacts his agenda, it will increase inflation.\n\nAdd to that list of nonpartisan researchers Moody's Analytics, which recently issued a report arguing that Trump's policies, if successfully enacted, would drive up inflation and likely lead to further monetary policy tightening by the Fed.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius concurs, arguing that a US-EU trade war escalation would increase US inflation by 1.1 percentage points while decreasing US real GDP by 0.5 points.\n\nMultiple freight executives also concur, asserting that higher tariffs will flow through their supply lines into higher consumer prices.\n\nOn the other hand, credit ratings agency Fitch makes an interesting argument. They argue that tariff hikes would cause only a temporary increase in inflation that would reverse into lower inflation over the medium term. Why? Because the negative economic effects of tariffs would cause aggregate demand to drop, eventually leading to disinflation or deflation in the goods sector.\n\nBottom line: While my all-else-equal view is that the inflationary surge is over, interest rates will decline somewhat going forward, and the US economy is returning to its pre-pandemic state of low inflation & interest rates, that view could be upended if Trump wins and is able to enact his policy agenda.\n\nI've been heavily buying REITs lately, which I view as extraordinarily attractive given my macro outlook. But while REITs generally handle inflation just fine, they perform poorly (on a stock price basis, at least) amid rising interest rates.\n\nWhat would perform best in an inflation & interest rate resurgence scenario?\n\nIn my view, the best stocks for such an environment are high-quality, low-debt, cash-rich, high pricing power, large-cap companies such as those found in the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) and WisdomTree US Quality Dividend Growth Fund ETF (DGRW).\n\nThe former is balanced between value and growth, while the latter is heavily weighted toward technology, which currently accounts for ~30% of the fund.\n\nTo illustrate the effect of having lots of cash and little debt on the balance sheet during a period of high interest rates, take a look at the net interest income (interest earned minus interest paid) for two of DGRW's top 10 holdings:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThe most cash-rich and low-debt corporations like Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are generating gushers of revenue just from the cash sitting on their balance sheets!\n\nHaving a strong balance sheet with lots of cash is itself a hedge against inflation.\n\nThe better Trump's odds of winning the election, the more attractive these types of stocks become to me relative to REITs.\n\nAlthough I would like to wait for a pullback in tech before buying those high-quality, cash-rich names, which I would do simply by buying DGRW.\n\nThe Great Lag of 2024\n\nIn the world of online video gamers, your worst nightmare is a bad Internet connection that causes you to lag. Lagging is when what shown on your screen is behind what is happening on the screens of gamers with better connections. Your screen shows what happened slightly in the past, causing your gaming performance and experience to suffer.\n\nIs this a perfect illustration? Maybe not, but stick with me.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been basing their all-important monetary policy decisions on lagging data, and this is greatly inhibiting their ability to set good policy.\n\nLooking back over the last five years, we find that growth in the US money supply peaked in early 2021, and then the US CPI peaked in mid-2022, and then the Fed Funds Rate (\"FFR\") peaked in mid-2023.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAt least in the case of the COVID-era inflation, the money supply was the head of the snake, while inflation was the body of the snake and the FFR was the tail of the snake.\n\nThis lag caused the Fed to be extremely late in raising rates, and now it is causing them to be late in lowering rates.\n\nYou might object that the CPI still shows inflation over 3%, which is well above the Fed's 2% target. But the Fed's inflation data lags real-time price changes in very important and heavily weighted sectors like housing.\n\nCompare, for example, Apartment List's rent index showing -0.7% YoY rent growth to the CPI's rent metric still over 5%.\n\nApartment List\n\nThe CPI's housing inflation metrics peaked a full year after real-time, private sector rent indices did.\n\nIn fact, the CPI's housing metrics also peaked over half a year after the headline CPI index.\n\nSo while the CPI still shows inflation over 3%, arguably better measurements like Truflation now show inflation under 2% and still falling.\n\nTruflation\n\nUsing Truflation, the real (inflation-adjusted) FFR is at its highest level in four decades.\n\nIf the Fed used a rules-based approach like the Taylor Rule, the FFR would have already declined 100 basis points by Q1 2024 and 140-150 basis points today.\n\nThe Taylor Rule would have pushed the FFR up much faster during the inflationary period of 2021-2022 and would put the FFR at about 3.9% today.\n\nAtlanta Fed\n\nAs long as the Fed's inflation data is lagging and inaccurate, the greater the odds of a \"policy mistake\" that leads to a recession, which will then cause Fed policy to whipsaw too far and for too long in the opposite direction.\n\nMy preference is not for zero interest rates forever. Back in 2019, I was critical of excessively easy monetary policy in articles like \"The Monetary Death Spiral.\"\n\nBut in lieu of a change to how monetary policy is determined, I believe investors should continue to expect Fed policy to continue aggravating the boom-bust economic cycle.\n\nRecession Odds Continue to Tick Up\n\nI continue to believe a recession is coming, in part because of lagging Fed reactions to economic changes but also because the post-COVID spending frenzy is fizzling out.\n\nAlready, the Institute For Supply Management's PMI indices have turned negative (below 50) for both services and manufacturing.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nWith over 3/4ths of the US economy geared toward services, slipping into negative territory in this area -- in addition to manufacturing, which has been negative for years now -- is another significant sign of slowdown in the US economy.\n\nI've said it many times before, and I'll keep saying it for as long as it remains true: Broadly speaking, US consumers are losing steam. Their spending power is diminishing.\n\nYou could look at the historically low savings rate, and you could also look at US credit card debt and delinquency rates, which have soared higher over the last few years:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nYou might observe that the current delinquency rate isn't as high as its peak during the Great Financial Crisis. But keep in mind two points:\n\nThe GFC was the worst recession since the Great Depression, and The credit card delinquency rate is 100 basis points higher today than it was at the beginning of the GFC!\n\nLots of people bring up the fact that deficit spending is still quite high (~$2 trillion a year ain't no chump change) as an argument that fiscal stimulus will continue to drive economic growth.\n\nWrong.\n\nToday's government spending is fundamentally different than the spending of 2020-2021 that fueled the post-COVID economic surge. Back then, government spending directly funded consumer spending via stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment, and PPP loans that kept workers employed even if they weren't working.\n\nToday, government spending is driven by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest expense, and tax credits for the semiconductor and green energy industries.\n\nToday's government spending may be stimulative and inflationary in certain pockets of the economy, but the government spending of 2021-2022 stimulated the entire economy.\n\nBack then, government spending grew the money supply. Today, it is simply growing the supply of Treasury debt.\n\nThe final point I'd make on the subject of recession odds relates to unemployment, which has been slowly rising after bottoming out from mid-2022 to mid-2023.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nIf you look at a snapshot, the labor market still appears quite strong, but the trend is no longer one of strengthening but rather one of weakening.\n\nHistorically, once the unemployment rate begins an upward trend, it doesn't tend to stop moving up before a recession hits.\n\nIt's possible we avoid a recession, of course, but according to historical precedent, the next phase in the cycle would be recession.\n\nAnd to connect this to the tariffs discussion above, note that if a recession does begin sometime this year, the incumbent president's chances of winning reelection go down significantly. I would guess that is true of the incumbent president's party as well, given that the current POTUS may or may not be the presidential nominee for his party.\n\nIn short, then, a potential recession this year would increase the odds of a resurgent trade war next year and the years beyond.\n\nMy Buy List\n\nA few of my existing holdings have come back onto the buy list this week.\n\nRising odds of a Trump victory has caused green energy companies like Clearway Energy Inc. (CWEN, CWEN.A) and Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (HASI) to drop. I view this as a buying opportunity for two main reasons:\n\nThe likelihood of even a Republican sweep leading to a reversal of the green energy incentives in the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" seems low to me. Many of these renewable energy projects are located in Republican states like my home state of Texas, which generates more electricity from renewables than any other state. Lower interest rates would have a strongly positive effect on renewable energy companies by lowering their cost of financing investments. It is my view that the US will get lower interest rates over the next few years.\n\nWhile CWEN directly owns wind, solar, battery storage, and natural gas power generation facilities, HASI's business model is to act as a financier for both utility-scale and small-scale green energy assets.\n\nAt the same time, while I find these renewable energy names attractive, I'm also aggressively building my position in Sempra (SRE), in part for its regulated utility assets in fast-growing Texas but also because of its strong market position in LNG export infrastructure.\n\nSRE owns LNG liquefaction and export terminals on both the West Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, positioning the company to benefit from the growth in American LNG exports both East and West -- to Europe as well as to Asia.\n\nDividend Yield Projected Forward Dividend Growth Rate (Guesstimate) American Tower (AMT) 3.3% High-Single-Digit Clearway Energy Inc. (CWEN.A) 7.3% Mid-Single-Digit Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (HASI) 5.7% Mid-Single-Digit InvenTrust Properties (IVT) 3.7% Mid- to High-Single-Digit Rexford Industrial (REXR) 3.7% High-Single-Digit to Low-Double-Digit Sempra (SRE) 3.3% Mid- to High-Single-Digit Essential Utilities (WTRG) 3.3% Mid- to High-Single-Digit Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) 3.7% Mid-Single-Digit to Low-Double-Digit Click to enlarge\n\nWhere's Comcast?\n\nI've decided to hold off on buying any more Comcast (CMCSA) for now for two reasons. First, though it's still buyable, I'd prefer focusing on the other names in my buy list in which I have greater conviction. And second, I haven't finished my deep dive of the company yet.\n\nCMCSA looks extraordinarily cheap at about a 9x P/E ratio and a free cash flow yield of ~8.8%. Even if revenue growth remains slow at 1-3%, CMCSA is only paying out 35-40% of that FCF as dividends, leaving tons of retained cash for buybacks and growth investments.\n\nAnd management have a pretty good track record of solid capital allocation. The historical return on invested capital (outside of the COVID-19 years) averages 11%, which is where CMCSA's ROIC has returned over the last four quarters.\n\nThat said, there's still the issue of the dying cable TV industry, which I'll get to more deeply in a future article.\n\nFor now, I'll simply note that this subscriber loss is not exclusive to cable TV providers like CMCSA.\n\nIn Q1 2024, although new subscriptions continued to outpace cancellations for streaming services, streamers still saw record numbers of cancellations.\n\nChartr\n\nIt's part of a growing trend of cancellations.\n\nLikewise, surprisingly, subscriptions to Alphabet's (GOOGL) live TV service, YouTube TV, saw its first-ever contraction in subscriptions in Q1 2024.\n\nMoffettNathanson\n\nThat's partly sports-related, as cancellations tend to be pronounced in Q1 after the end of football season. But in past Q1s, the net change in subscriptions was still positive, perhaps partially because YouTube TV captured some of the cable TV cord cutters.\n\nSo, yes, while CMCSA lost ~487,000 cable TV subscribers in Q1 and are down some 2 million subscribers YoY, it's an industry-wide problem. Consumers are cutting back on all types of video content subscriptions, whether they're delivered through a wire or not.\n\nI think this says more about the current state of US consumers than it does about CMCSA or cable TV.\n\nYes, regardless, cable TV is slowly dying. But as the cigarette makers demonstrate, it is possible to continue growing cash profits by raising prices while investing in new products.\n\nAlso keep in mind that CMCSA owns the #1 broadband provider in the country: Xfinity. Losses in cable TV could be partly offset by selling more premium broadband plans that can support streaming live video content.",

    "title": "Suncor Energy Stock: Soaring Buybacks And Dividends (NYSE:SU)",
    "body": "dan_prat\n\nArticle Thesis\n\nSuncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) is a leading Canadian oil sands player that has offered appealing shareholder returns and should deliver even more of the same going forward. While shares have offered compelling returns over the last year, Suncor's shares are still far from expensive, which is why further upside potential exists.\n\nPast Coverage\n\nI have covered Suncor Energy Inc. in the past here on Seeking Alpha, most recently in May 2023. In that article, I focused on the company's quarterly earnings results at the time. Since more than a year has passed and since Suncor Energy recently made changes to its shareholder return framework, it is time to take another look at this Canadian energy player.\n\nSuncor Energy: Recent Business Performance\n\nThe company's first-quarter earnings results beat estimates where it counts, as Suncor Energy outperformed the analyst consensus earnings per share estimate, even though the company missed the revenue consensus estimate slightly. In other words, sales were marginally lower than expected, but since costs were lower than expected as well (and by a wider margin), the company nevertheless was more profitable than forecasted.\n\nAlong with profits, shareholders also care about cash flows, of course. Cash flows, after all, allow Suncor Energy to reduce its debt pile, to buy back shares, and to offer growing dividends. During the most recent quarter, Suncor Energy's funds from operations -- basically operating cash flows adjusted for working capital movements -- came in at CAD$3.2 billion, or almost CAD$13 billion annualized. For a company that is currently being valued at CAD$66 billion, that makes for a very nice cash generation pace, as the cash flow yield is 19.7%.\n\nNot all of that cash is available for shareholder returns and debt reduction, of course, as Suncor Energy also needs to invest in current and future assets. While its oil sands assets are long-lived and do thus not require heavy maintenance capital expenditures, some maintenance capital spending is needed, and Suncor Energy also invests in new assets on top of that. These investments in new assets are partially to grow production in the long run, and partially to replace existing assets' production eventually since even longer-lived assets will not produce oil forever. Suncor Energy's growth capital spending (and M&A) in the past has allowed the company to hit a new record-high level when it comes to production, as production averaged 835,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the most recent quarter. Not surprisingly, production mostly came from Suncor Energy's oil sands assets, where a record-high was hit as well, with 785,000 barrels per day.\n\nSuncor Energy's capital expenditures, including maintenance and growth spending, totaled CAD$1.2 billion during the most recent quarter, which translated into a free funds flow number of almost CAD$2 billion, which would be equal to the company's free cash flow at unchanged working capital levels. CAD$8 billion annualized in free cash flow would make for a free cash flow yield of close to 12% at the current market capitalization of CAD$68 billion.\n\nMacro Environment\n\nOf course, commodity companies such as Suncor Energy do not generate the same profit and cash flow every quarter. After all, commodity price movements -- in this case, the movements in the price of oil -- have a significant impact on a quarter-to-quarter basis, even if underlying business growth in terms of production and refining levels is growing reliably.\n\nLooking at oil prices, we see the following:\n\nWTI price per barrel in 2024 (Seeking Alpha)\n\nThe price per barrel of WTI has risen nicely so far this year, while the start of the year was not especially strong. In Q1, the average was around $75, while the second quarter average was a little higher -- the Q2 high was higher than the Q1 high and the Q2 low was also higher than the Q1 low. The current quarter, Q3, has started nicely as well, with WTI trading close to the 2024 high right now. From an oil price perspective, the second quarter thus was a little better compared to the first quarter, which should be positive for energy companies when they report their Q2 results in the coming month or so.\n\nOn top of that, Canadian energy companies also benefitted from another tailwind. The Trans Mountain expansion started moving oil in May, adding transportation capacity to the West Coast and the export terminals located there. This has had a positive impact on the differential between US crude oil and Canadian crude oil, with WTI crude oil rising by 18% so far this year, while Syncrude Sweet Premium has risen by a much stronger 35% so far this year, according to oilprice.com. Other Canadian blends have performed well, too, but since Suncor Energy has the biggest ownership stake in the Syncrude joint venture at around 60%, this blend looks especially meaningful for Suncor.\n\nSuncor Energy refines some of the oil it produces, so it will not capture all of the benefits of improving differentials, but between some differential tailwinds and firming oil markets, Q2 and Q3, so far, look quite good.\n\nSuncor Energy's Updated Shareholder Return Framework\n\nThe COVID crisis with very low oil prices forced many oil companies to add debt, and in the following years, interest rates rose, which made debt more costly. In order to drive down interest expenses and to prepare for potential future crises, Suncor Energy and many other energy companies decided to reduce their debt levels. Suncor Energy installed a capital allocation framework that would dictate how the company would use its available cash, depending on how large its debt position was at any specific time. The plan foresaw rising shareholder returns and a declining focus on reducing debt levels as debt reduction efforts progressed -- the higher the debt level, the larger the focus on reducing debt, while low debt levels would mean that more cash would be diverted toward the company's owners.\n\nThe company recently showed a new capital allocation framework in its 2024 business update:\n\nSuncor Energy capital allocation policy (Seeking Alpha)\n\nWhile the company previously planned to lower its net debt to $5 billion, the floor has now been lifted to $8 billion. The company will thus begin to return 100% of its excess free funds flow via buybacks sooner than previously thought, as fewer dollars will have to be used for debt reduction purposes.\n\nRight now, Suncor Energy is at the 75% buyback level, which is already an increase compared to the last couple of years, when the company was putting 50% of its excess free funds flow towards buybacks. Investors can thus expect an increased buyback pace going forward, which will mean the share count will decline even faster in the future, all else equal.\n\nCombined with the expected free cash flow growth stemming from cost reduction programs, improving differentials, and production growth from growth investments, should result in highly compelling free cash flow per share growth in the coming years. In its business update presentation, Suncor Energy guides for a free funds flow per share growth rate of 24% in the 2023 to 2026 time frame, which would be excellent, but even if the company missed that goal and would deliver just two-thirds of that, i.e. 16%, that would still be a highly attractive performance considering the energy industry is seen as a low-growth industry by many.\n\nThe dividend yields around 4.2% at current prices, which is way above the broad market's (SPY) 1.3% dividend yield. Suncor Energy guides for dividend growth of 3% to 5% per year, as we can see in the above slide, which would make for a very solid combination. But with free fund flows per share forecasted to grow way faster than that, I wouldn't be surprised if Suncor eventually decided to up the dividend growth rate. Over the last five years, the dividend was increased by 5.3% per year, and this includes the dividend cut we saw during the initial phase of the pandemic when many oil companies were struggling. If SU was able to grow the dividend by more than 5% per year despite this one-time macro crisis, I believe that there is a solid chance for dividend growth of more than 5% per year in the future, too.\n\nIs Suncor Energy Still Attractive?\n\nShares have rallied by 18% so far in 2024, so in retrospect, buying half a year ago was better than buying today. But even today, Suncor seems like a pretty appealing pick.\n\nShares trade for 9x this year's expected net profits, while the dividend yield is attractive as well, at 4%. As noted above, buybacks are getting even better, and between business growth, macro tailwinds from rising oil prices and the Trans Mountain expansion, and cost-saving programs, Suncor should deliver highly compelling profit and cash flow growth going forward.\n\nWhile I do not believe that SU is ultra-cheap any longer, I believe that Suncor remains undervalued today. Buying this growing energy company with excellent shareholder returns at a single-digit earnings multiple seems like a good idea for long-term-oriented investors.",
    "summary": "Past CoverageI have covered Suncor Energy Inc. in the past here on Seeking Alpha, most recently in May 2023.\nSuncor Energy: Recent Business PerformanceThe company's first-quarter earnings results beat estimates where it counts, as Suncor Energy outperformed the analyst consensus earnings per share estimate, even though the company missed the revenue consensus estimate slightly.\nCash flows, after all, allow Suncor Energy to reduce its debt pile, to buy back shares, and to offer growing dividends.\nCAD$8 billion annualized in free cash flow would make for a free cash flow yield of close to 12% at the current market capitalization of CAD$68 billion.\nMacro EnvironmentOf course, commodity companies such as Suncor Energy do not generate the same profit and cash flow every quarter.",

    "body": "By Andrea Shalal and Nandita Bose\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -Amid increasing calls from fellow Democrats to end his campaign for re-election, U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday gave no hint that he was considering stepping aside after a pair of defiant public appearances a day earlier.\n\nBiden, 81, is facing a slow-boil uprising from congressional Democrats and some influential donors who have grown concerned he lacks the capacity to defeat Republican Donald Trump, 78, in the Nov. 5 election. A much-anticipated interview the president gave to ABC News that aired Friday evening seemed to do little to temper those worries.\n\nIn that interview, Biden said only the \"Lord Almighty\" could persuade him to abandon his campaign, dismissing the possibility that Democratic leaders could band together to try and talk him into standing down. He held a business-as-usual call with the national co-chairs of his campaign on Saturday, the White House said.\n\nPressure from Congress seems only likely to ramp up in the coming days as lawmakers return to Washington from a holiday recess, with Biden perhaps facing one of the most consequential weeks of his presidency.\n\nEven as his future will be debated on Capitol Hill, Biden will host dozens of world leaders at a high-stakes NATO summit in Washington and is scheduled to hold what is sure to be a closely watched press conference.\n\nOn Saturday, U.S. Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota became the first Democratic member of the House of Representatives in a battleground district to call for Biden to relent.\n\n\u201cGiven what I saw and heard from the President during last week\u2019s debate in Atlanta, coupled with the lack of a forceful response from the President himself following that debate, I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump,\u201d Craig, a top 2024 target of House Republican efforts, posted on X.\n\nSome Democratic House lawmakers are circulating two separate letters calling for Biden to step aside, House Democratic sources have said. Many of those lawmakers had been waiting to see the ABC News interview before moving forward.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries scheduled a virtual meeting on Sunday with senior House Democrats to discuss Biden\u2019s candidacy and the path forward.\n\nU.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas, who had previously called on Biden to step aside, told CNN after the ABC interview, \"Every day (Biden) delays makes it more difficult for a new person to come on board to defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nMeanwhile on the Senate side, U.S. Senator Mark Warner was contacting some fellow Democratic senators to invite them to a possible meeting on Monday to discuss Biden's campaign.\n\nBiden spent Saturday at his home in Delaware, with no public events on his schedule, although he attended an evening church service. Sunday will be a busy day for him, with two Pennsylvania campaign events in Philadelphia and Harrisburg.\n\nAt a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin on Friday, Biden vowed to stay in the race.\n\n\"I am running and gonna win again,\" Biden told supporters.\n\nSome polls show Trump's lead over Biden widening, and Democrats worry concerns about the president could weigh on down-ballot races.\n\nBut Biden registered his best showing yet in a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult tracking poll of battleground states, with Trump leading Biden by only 2 percentage points, 47% to 45%, in the critical states needed to win the November election.\n\nOne bright spot for Biden came early Saturday, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas accepted a U.S. proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages, including soldiers and men, a move that could pave the way for a ceasefire to end the nine-month-old war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the top choice to replace Biden if he were to step aside as the Democratic Party's standard-bearer, spoke in New Orleans at the Essence Festival of Culture, an annual culture and music festival sponsored by Essence magazine, whose target audience is Black women.\n\nHarris attacked former President Donald Trump and the US Supreme Court for taking away abortion rights. The appearance was part of an effort by the Biden campaign to shore up support among Black voters.\n\nHarris on Friday posted a supportive note on X after Biden's rally in Madison, saying the president had devoted his life to fighting for Americans. \"In this moment, I know all of us are ready to fight for him,\" she said.\n\nMargaret Washa, 75, a retired physical therapist from Middleton, Wisconsin, saw Biden at the Madison rally and thought he looked more vigorous, but grew dismayed after watching the interview.\n\n\"It's starting to be about him and whether he can do it, and rather than about what's best for our nation, and about turning over leadership to the next generation,\" she said. \"It's time to pass the baton. There are so many good, strong, younger, intelligent, more charismatic Democrats out there.\"",

    "body": "By Boureima Balima\n\nNIAMEY (Reuters) -Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, three military-led West African states, signed a confederation treaty on Saturday, underscoring their determination to chart a joint course outside the regional political and economic bloc that has been urging them to return to democratic rule.\n\nThe signing took place at the first summit of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES (NYSE: )) and signals an ever-closer alignment between the neighbours in the insurgency-torn central Sahel. Juntas seized control in a series of coups in the three states in 2020-2023 and severed military and diplomatic ties with regional allies and Western powers.\n\nNiger's military leader General Abdourahamane Tiani described the AES summit as \"the culmination of our determined common will to reclaim our national sovereignty\".\n\nFormalising the treaty to establish a confederation confirms the rejection by Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso of the 15-member Economic Community of West African states (ECOWAS). Its signing comes a day before a summit being held by ECOWAS, which had hoped to persuade the three to reconsider their decision in January to quit the bloc.\n\n\"Our peoples have irrevocably turned their backs on ECOWAS,\" Tiani said in a speech. \"It is up to us today to make the AES Confederation an alternative to any artificial regional group by building ... a community free from the control of foreign powers.\"\n\nIt is not clear how closely the AES will harmonise political, economic and defence policies as it struggles to contain a decade-old battle with Islamist insurgents and grow economies that are among the world's poorest.\n\nIn March, the three states agreed to set up a joint force to tackle security threats across their territories.\n\nIn a communique issued after the summit, the countries said they had agreed to coordinate diplomatic actions, create an AES investment bank and stabilisation fund, and pool their resources to set up projects in strategic sectors including mining, energy and agriculture.\n\nThe heads of state \"welcomed their irrevocable withdrawal without delay from ECOWAS,\" it said.\n\nECOWAS has made diplomatic efforts to dissuade the three states from quitting the 50-year-old alliance. The split will reverse decades of regional integration and threatens a messy disentanglement from trade and services flows of nearly $150 billion a year.\n\nThe falling-out is linked to the ECOWAS decision to respond to the trio's coups with stringent sanctions and its unrealised threat to use force to restore constitutional rule in Niger last year.\n\nNiger, Mali and Burkina Faso accuse the regional bloc of abandoning its founding ideals and giving too little support against the Islamist insurgencies that have killed thousands of people and displaced over 3 million more.\n\nThe policies of the juntas have reshaped international influence in the central Sahel, with the three states fostering closer defence, diplomatic and business ties with Russia at the expense of former colonial power France, regional heavyweight Nigeria, and the United States.",

    "title": "Here's Why the Petrodollar Isn't Going Anywhere",
    "body": "Recently, a few media outlets have warned of the imminent demise of the petrodollar agreement, commonly called the petrodollar. With such narratives comes investor anxiety. Consider the following headlines on the topic.\n\nOPEC Will Sever Link With Dollar For Pricing Oil- The New York Times\n\nThe Petrodollar Is Dead and that\u2019s a big deal- FX Street\n\nAfter 50 Years, Death of the Petrodollar Signal End of U.S. Hegemony- The Street Pro\n\nBefore jumping to conclusions, let\u2019s discuss what the petrodollar is and isn\u2019t. With that knowledge, we can address concerns about the death of the petrodollar. Furthermore, we can discredit menacing headlines like- Petrodollar Deal Expires; Why This Could Trigger \u2018Collapse of Everything.\u2019\n\nBefore starting, we need to make a disclaimer. The New York Times article we bullet point above is not recent. We added it to show this is not a new story. The article dated June 1975 starts as follows:\n\nLIBREVILLE, Gabon, June 9 \u2014 The oil\u2010producing nations agreed today to sever the link between oil prices and the dollar and to start quoting prices in Special Drawing Rights, the governor of the Iranian national bank, Mohammed Yeganeh, said.\n\nWhat Is The Petrodollar?\n\nIn 1974, following the economically devastating oil embargo in which the price of per barrel rose four-fold, sparking a surge in inflation and weakening the economy, the U.S. desperately sought to avoid another embargo at all costs. U.S. politicians theorized that a stronger relationship with Saudi Arabia would go a long way toward achieving its goal.\n\nFortunately, the Saudis also hoped for a beneficial relationship with the U.S., and they needed a trustworthy investment home for their new oil riches. They also desired better military equipment. At the time, Saudi Arabia was running a huge budget surplus because of its windfall from high oil prices and relatively minor spending needs from within the country.\n\nWhile there was never a formal petrodollar pact, it is widely believed that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia had a handshake agreement to meet each other\u2019s needs. Saudi Arabia was encouraged to invest its surplus in safe, high-yielding U.S. Treasury securities. In exchange, the U.S. would sell Saudi Arabia's military equipment. Both hoped a better relationship would be a productive byproduct. Such is the petrodollar agreement.\n\nThe Petrodollar Was Not Really About The Dollar\n\nWe think the petrodollar discussions were principally about Saudi Arabia needing a safe home for their surpluses and the U.S. seeking dollars to fund her large fiscal deficits. While the dollar would be the currency for said transactions, it was not likely the focus of the talks.\n\nIn dealing with the immense costs of the Vietnam War and ambitious social spending to pacify social unrest, America sought deficit funding. Saudi Arabia needed to invest in its surpluses. Given the unprecedented liquidity and safety of the U.S. Treasury market compared to other options, the \u201cagreement\u201d made a lot of sense for both parties. Furthermore, because Saudi oil revenue would be used to buy dollar-based U.S. Treasury bonds, it made sense for Saudi Arabia to require other oil buyers to pay in U.S. dollars.\n\nWe share two graphs to better appreciate the deteriorating U.S. fiscal position at the time. The first graph below highlights the deficits during the mid-1970s. Today, many would consider a $50\u2014or $60 billion deficit minimal. But then, the deficits incurred were a sharp departure from the norm.\n\nThe second graph provides proper context. The nation was experiencing more significant federal deficits in the mid-to late 1970s than it faced during World War II. Given the immense spending on World War II, that fact was stunning to many people at the time.\n\nSaudi Arabia Doesn\u2019t Have Investible Dollars\n\nToday, the situation is different. America still desperately needs funding, but Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t have budget surpluses to invest. Per a Bloomberg article entitled The Petrodollar Is Dead, Long Live The Petrodollar:\n\nFast forward to today, and Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t have a surplus to recycle at all. Instead, the country is borrowing heavily in the sovereign debt market and selling assets, including chunks of its national oil company, to finance its grand economic plans. True, Riyadh still holds significant hard currency reserves, some of them invested in US Treasuries. But it\u2019s not accumulating them anymore. China and Japan have significant more money tied up on the American debt market than the Saudis do.\n\nThe Reserves Monopoly\n\nMany believe the U.S. government bullies foreign countries into using the dollar, thus forcing them to have dollar reserves. Such seems logical as the reserves must be invested and can help fund our deficits.\n\nWe do not know what our politicians say to other countries behind closed doors. But we presume some \u201cpersuasion\u201d presses other countries to use the dollar. Regardless, there are not many options for the dollar.\n\nThe U.S. offers other nations the best place to invest for four primary reasons. As we outline in :\n\nThe four reasons, the rule of law, liquid financial markets, and economic and military might, all but guarantee the death of the dollar will not occur anytime soon.\n\nNo other country has all four of those traits. China and Russia lack the rule of law and liquid financial markets. Russia also has a small and fragile economy. Europe does not have liquid enough capital markets or military might.\n\nand are often rumored candidates to usurp the dollar. For starters, they do not earn a return on investment. Possibly more problematic, their prices are incredibly volatile. There are many other difficulties precluding them from full-fledged currency status, which we will save for another article.\n\nSummary\n\nNotwithstanding whether there was a formal agreement, the petrodollar is not going anywhere. Even if Saudi Arabia accepts , , , or gold for its oil, it will need to convert those currencies into dollars in almost all instances.\n\nConsider that Saudi Arabia keeps its currency value pegged to the dollar, as shown in the graph below, courtesy of Trading Economics. They also hold approximately $135 billion of U.S. Treasury securities, a three-year high. Does it seem like Saudi Arabia is trying to disassociate from the U.S. dollar and U.S. financial markets?\n\nStories like those on the petrodollar and others on the \u201cimminent\u201d death of the dollar have been around for decades. Someday they will be right, and the dollar will follow the way of prior global reserve currencies. But for that to happen there needs to be a better alternative, and today, nothing even close exists.",

    "body": "By Davide Barbuscia\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -A recalibration of how the U.S. presidential election plays out is causing bond investors to bet yields stay higher for longer as November approaches.\n\nYields have risen sharply after President Joe Biden's stumbling performance against Republican rival Donald Trump in the first presidential debate last month, which increased speculation about a second Trump win when voters go to the polls on Nov. 5. The benchmark 10-year yield rose about six points to 4.34% following the debate.\n\nSome investors are betting on higher inflation under Trump because of trade and economic policies such as higher tariffs on imports, and profligate government spending along with lower tax revenues, which would boost fiscal deficits and U.S. debt levels. Trump's team has said his pro-growth policies would bring down interest rates and shrink deficits.\n\nRepublican National Committee spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement that the market reaction to Trump's \"debate victory reflected the anticipation of the strong-growth, low-inflation reality that President Trump will deliver once again.\"\n\nSome have said a reckoning on U.S. debt will eventually catch up with the country and market.\n\n\"The lens (is) really starting to turn to the fiscal and the debt dynamics,\" said Mary-Therese Barton, fixed income chief investment officer at Pictet Asset Management. \"(The) rate-cutting cycle is perhaps shallower than expected with a focus more on the longer end.\"\n\nThose concerns around widening fiscal deficits and the rising government debt burden threaten to limit any nascent rally in bonds, expected as the Federal Reserve gets closer to cutting rates after an aggressive hiking cycle to tame inflation.\n\n\"We feel the probability of (a) Trump election victory has risen,\" John Velis, Americas macro strategist at BNY, wrote in a note. \"Our faith in lower yields going forward has been eroded and we wouldn't be surprised to see a continuation of the very recent moves higher in yields.\"\n\nShorter-dated Treasuries, more directly linked to changes in monetary policy, could still rally in case of rate cuts, but even for bond bulls the outlook for longer-dated Treasuries has become cloudier. Longer dated debt tends to reflect expectations for economic growth, inflation and the fiscal outlook.\n\n\"The headwind that we've been seeing should start abating and we do think investors will start focusing more on the cutting cycle,\" said Anders Persson, chief investment officer and head of global fixed income at Nuveen.\n\nHowever, \"that's probably going to show up more on the front end of the curve like the two-year for instance,\" he noted. \"The 10-year will be a little bit trickier to call given the elections and if inflation is a little bit stickier.\"\n\n'FRUSTRATION'\n\nInvestors had bet heavily early this year on a normalization of interest rates, but that has sharply changed with the Fed increasingly being seen as pushing rate cuts out further. Traders of futures contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate are betting on about two rate cuts for the rest of 2024, one-third of the policy easing investors were hoping for in January.\n\nBonds rally when rates are lowered because existing securities yield more than new ones and become more valuable. But as monetary easing has proven elusive, what appeared to be a straightforward trade as the year began has become a test of patience for investors.\n\n\"I think there was some frustration with some people who took that big positioning,\" especially on behalf of clients, said Kevin McCullough, portfolio consultant at Natixis Investment Managers. \"That's a real hard conversation to have.\"\n\nA measure of total returns for Treasuries since the beginning of the year remains in negative territory despite yields having declined from their annual peak in April.\n\nYear-to-date total returns, which include bond payouts and price fluctuations, were minus 0.6% as of Friday, the ICE BofA US Treasury Index showed. Returns have been negative since early February.\n\nRegardless of the election outcome, many investors are optimistic on bonds as yields have become more attractive in an environment of higher rates.\n\n\"We still have six months left to carry in fixed income ... and obviously if yields move lower from here still, there's potential for even more appreciation,\" said Mike Cudzil, managing director and generalist portfolio manager at PIMCO, one of the world's biggest bond investors.\n\nOn Friday, yields declined after closely-watched jobs data that appeared to show the U.S. labor market weakening.\n\n\"Whoever wins the election, regardless if Republican or Democrat, the loser is going to be the deficit,\" said Cudzil. \"I think what will matter more is the slowing of inflation, the slowing of growth.\"",

The storm is anticipated to be the first to make landfall in the US for the 2024 Atlantic season.\n\nEarlier in the week, Beryl escalated into a Category 5 hurricane, the earliest on record in the Atlantic, causing at least nine fatalities across the Caribbean. The casualties included two in Jamaica, three in Venezuela, three in Grenada, and one in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, Beryl, downgraded to a tropical storm, was situated approximately 545 miles from Corpus Christi, Texas, after inflicting significant wind, rain, and storm surge impacts on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and several Caribbean islands.\n\nForecasts predict Beryl will regain strength on Sunday before its projected landfall in South Texas.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued hurricane and storm surge watches for parts of the Texas coast as of Friday night. A hurricane watch extends from the mouth of the Rio Grande to San Luis Pass, while a storm surge watch is in effect from the Rio Grande to High Island, including coastal Harris County.\n\nFurthermore, a hurricane watch has been declared for the northeastern coast of Mexico, from Barra el Mezquital to the mouth of the Rio Grande.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center expects Beryl to reach the vicinity of Corpus Christi as a Category 1 hurricane around midday Monday.

    "title": "What Biden 2.0 Could Mean for Energy Stocks: Impact and Analysis By Investing.com",
    "body": "President Joe Biden is running for re-election, and his potential second term could significantly impact various sectors, including energy. Understanding the implications of Biden 2.0 on energy stocks is crucial for investors, given the administration's strong focus on climate change, renewable energy, and regulatory changes.\n\nBiden\u2019s energy policies starkly contrast with the Trump administration's focus on deregulation and support for fossil fuels. Trump\u2019s tenure saw rollbacks on environmental regulations and increased drilling activities, while Biden\u2019s agenda pushes for decarbonization and clean energy incentives.\n\nWhat are Key Energy Policies for Biden\n\nBiden\u2019s key policies and initiatives include rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, setting a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, and promoting investments in electric vehicles, renewable energy, and energy efficiency through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\nDuring Biden's first term, clean energy stocks have generally outperformed traditional energy stocks. Companies in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency sectors have made significant gains, while fossil fuel producers have faced challenges due to stricter regulations and the transition to clean energy.\n\nIf elected for a second term, Biden is expected to continue his administration's focus on clean energy and climate change. However, the extent of potential changes will depend on the balance of power in Congress. A split Congress could lead to more moderate policies and a slower pace of change, while a Democratic majority could enable bolder initiatives.\n\nClean energy stocks are likely to remain attractive investments, with continued growth in sectors like solar, wind, and electric vehicles. However, the performance of traditional energy stocks will depend on factors such as global demand, supply dynamics, and the pace of the energy transition.\n\nWhich Stocks to Consider if Biden Wins?\n\nBut which stocks will be in focus on Biden\u2019s win? To begin with, a Biden administration is expected to continue supporting clean energy incentives that could benefit companies like First Solar (NYSE: NASDAQ: ), NextEra Energy (NYSE: NYSE: ), and Sunrun (NYSE: NASDAQ: ).\n\nMarket analysts project that a second Biden term could sustain the momentum for renewable energy stocks. Investments in solar, wind, and battery storage are expected to rise. Conversely, traditional energy stocks may continue to face headwinds from increased regulatory scrutiny and a potential decline in demand for fossil fuels.\n\nOn the contrary, a Trump win could lead to increased investment in the oil and gas sector, favoring producers like Exxon Mobil (NYSE: NYSE: ), Cheniere Energy (NYSE: NYSE: ), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: NYSE: ).\n\nAt the same time, a second Trump term, which will come after a gap of four years, could bring new import tariffs, which could impact the discretionary spending but benefiting domestic manufacturers like Ford Motor (NYSE: NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: NYSE: ), Nucor (NYSE: NYSE: ), and Steel Dynamics (NYSE: NASDAQ: ).\n\nIn case of a Biden win, investors can consider increasing their exposure to renewable energy stocks, focusing on companies with strong growth prospects in solar, wind, and energy storage.\n\nElectrification and hydrogen production could also see gains under Biden\u2019s support, benefiting stocks such as Eaton (NYSE: NYSE: ), Quanta Services (NYSE: NYSE: ), and Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE: NYSE: ).\n\nHowever, on the contrary, companies in energy-efficient products and recycling could continue to make leaps with the ongoing incentives irrespective of the outcome of presidential elections.\n\nSome of the stocks falling under this category include Johnson Controls (NYSE: NYSE: ), Trane Technologies (NYSE: NYSE: ), Waste Management (NYSE: NYSE: ), and Republic Services (NYSE: NYSE: ).\n\nLong story short, the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election will have significant implications for the energy sector. A Biden 2.0 presidency is expected to continue the administration's focus on clean energy and climate change mitigation, which could benefit companies in sectors like solar, wind, and electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, the performance of traditional energy stocks will depend on various factors, including global demand, supply dynamics, and the pace of the energy transition. Investors should carefully consider their energy sector exposure and monitor policy developments.",

Since 2018, the U.S. has imposed increasing restrictions on what tools the company can export to China, its second-largest market after Taiwan, citing security concerns. Most recently the U.S. has sought to keep the company from servicing equipment already sold to Chinese customers.\n\n\"These kind of discussions are not being conducted on the basis of facts or content or numbers or data but on the basis of ideology,\" Wennink said.\n\n\"You can think whatever you want about that, but we're a business where the interests of your stakeholders have to be managed in balance ... If ideology cuts straight through that, I have problems with that.\"\n\nHe said the company has had customers and staff in China for 30 years \"so you also have obligations\".\n\nAs part of seeking to strike a balance, Wennink said he had lobbied where possible to prevent export restrictions from becoming too tight, and at the same time he had complained to high-ranking Chinese politicians when he felt the company's intellectual property wasn't being respected.\n\n\"I think in Washington, maybe they sometimes thought, that Mr. Wennink, maybe he's a friend of China,\" he said.\n\n\"No. I'm a friend to my customers, to my suppliers, to my employees, to my shareholders.\"\n\nHe forecast that given geopolitical interests are at stake, the chip war could take decades to play out.\n\n\"This is going to go on for a while,\" he said.",

Personal consumption expenditures data for May indicate that inflation is on track to reach the Fed\u2019s 2.0% target by year-end.\n\nAdditionally, consumer spending remains robust, aligning with a positive economic outlook. The firm states, \"Moderating inflation with a robust economy argue against the Fed\u2019s easing this year.\"\n\nFiscal policy further supports maintaining current rates, according to the firm. They note the federal deficit is at 6.7% of GDP, a record for an economic expansion, while unemployment has stayed below 4.0% for 30 months.\n\nIn addition, the firm believes this fiscal stimulus could reheat the economy and inflation if rates are cut. They note, \"The Fed is effectively fighting stimulative fiscal policy that would reheat the economy and inflation if rates aren\u2019t kept at current higher levels.\"\n\n\n\nAnalysts also believe labor market and growth indicators suggest maintaining rates. They explain that the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model forecasts 2.2% real GDP growth for Q2, consistent with the previous year's trajectory, while the economy's strong performance in services and high-tech sectors reduces sensitivity to higher interest rates.\n\nLastly, the risk of financial market reactions to rate cuts is significant, according to the firm. They warn, \"Preemptive interest-rate cuts would expand Tech sector valuations further and invite a late-1990s-style melt-up of the stock market broadly.\"\n\nWith a healthy economy, moderating inflation, and a stable labor market, the firm concludes that the Fed should keep the federal funds rate steady through the remainder of the year.",

    "body": "As the second half of 2024 begins, market participants are reassessing their expectations for earnings growth not only for this year but for 2025 as well.\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street predict that the S&P 500 companies will see a robust 14.5% earnings-per-share (EPS) growth in 2025.\n\nAccording to analysts at Yardeni Research, this would mark an impressive follow-up to the anticipated 10.6% growth for this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re forecasting S&P 500 earnings-per-share growth of 12.1% this year and 8.0% in 2025,\u201d the financial research firm said in a recent report.\n\nThe forecasted breadth of earnings growth for next year is also noteworthy. Analysts expect all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 to experience earnings growth, along with all but 7 of the 135 S&P 500 industries.\n\nSuch widespread growth has been a strong driver of the S&P 500\u2019s forward earnings, which is the time-weighted average of consensus operating EPS estimates for the current and following year. This earnings strength supports the S&P 500 price index\u2019s 14.5% year-to-date gain through Friday\u2019s close, Yardeni notes.\n\nBy sector, the expected earnings growth for the S&P 500 is anticipated to be led by information technology, with a 20.2% expansion in 2025 and 19.3% in 2024.\n\nHealth Care is anticipated to see an increase of 18.4% in 2025 and 8.4% in 2024, while the Materials sector is forecasted to grow by 17.4% in 2025 after a decline of 2.2% in 2024. Industrials are anticipated to grow by 15.2% in 2025 and 5.7% in 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 overall is expected to grow by 14.5% in 2025 and 10.6% in 2024, Yardeni highlighted.\n\nReal estate is expected to see the slowest growth of 7.7% and 0.7% in 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n\nNotably, Yardeni also said that several industries with some of the strongest expected growth in 2025 may be flying under investors\u2019 radar because they\u2019re expected to have minimal earnings growth this year.\n\nFor instance, Interactive Home Entertainment, which tops the 2025 earnings growth list with a projected 46.5% increase in 2025 and 5.5% in 2024, falls into this category.\n\nOther industries expected to see sharply improving earnings growth in 2025 from low levels this year include Copper (39.6% in 2025, 7.1% in 2024), Paper & Plastic Packaging Products (24.7% in 2025, -5.2% in 2024), Personal Care Products (23.0% in 2025, -17.2% in 2024), and Passenger Airlines (20.3% in 2025, -3.9% in 2024), among others.\n\nMoreover, analysts at Yardeni highlighted strong earnings growth expectations for industries housing the MegaCap-8 stocks\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia, and Tesla\u2014projected to range from 8.9% to 46.5% in 2025.\n\nThe S&P 500 Semiconductors industry, led by Nvidia, is expected to see the highest growth at 38.8%.\n\nAlphabet and Meta, part of the Interactive Media & Services industry, are forecasted to grow earnings from 40.1% in 2023 to 32.1% in 2024 and 13.9% in 2025.\n\nAmazon, dominating the S&P 500 Broadline Retail industry, is poised to drive earnings growth of 52.6% in 2024 and 25.8% in 2025.\n\nNetflix, within the S&P 500 Movies and Entertainment industry, is projected to have earnings increase by 27.3% in 2025, after significant jumps of 65.9% in 2024 and 294.9% in 2023.\n\nApple, part of the S&P 500 Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, is expected to recover with earnings growth of 8.8% in 2024 and 14.2% in 2025, following a decline in 2023.\n\nThe Systems Software industry, including Microsoft and Oracle, is forecasted to moderate its earnings growth from 19.5% in 2024 to 12.9% in 2025.\n\nLastly, Tesla, in the S&P 500 Automobile Manufacturers industry, is projected to see a modest earnings increase of 8.9% in 2025, following lower growth rates of 2.8% in 2024 and a decline of 7.4% in 2023.",

While many might enjoy watching the theatrics of a magic show, my mind was always on how everything was done. I would record David Copperfield and watch, rewind, watch, rewind until the video was worn out. I was always trying to figure out the \"secret\" of the magic trick. I'd go to the library and read books about magic tricks, and take what I learned there to deduce how various performers tricked the mind.\n\nIt turns out, that many magic tricks have their basis in math. Those who create magic tricks use their knowledge of math, science, and psychology to devise illusions that create an entertaining show.\n\nToday, I am going to perform a magic trick, which has its basis in math. While the trick probably isn't going to get me an invitation to replace Criss Angel, it does provide great insight into how we should think about our investment portfolios and how we withdraw cash from them.\n\nDividends \"Don't Matter\"?\n\nSome have developed the theory that \"dividends don't matter\", and that an investor could achieve the same effect by selling off shares as they need cash. Their reasoning is that cash paid in dividends are paid from the company, and therefore the value of the company is reduced by the exact amount of the dividend.\n\nIndeed, cash paid from the company is not available for other uses. The book value of a company is reduced by the exact amount of the dividend with each payment.\n\nSo what is the one detail that this theory is missing out on?\n\nThe reality is that the stock market does not value companies based on book value. That's a good thing for the \"Magnificent 7\" as they trade at enormous premiums to book value:\n\nData by YCharts\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) trades at the smallest premium of \"just\" 785%. It would only have to fall 83% to trade at book value. NVIDIA (NVDA) trades at the largest premium to book value and would have to fall over 98% to reach book value.\n\nI'll go out on a limb and suggest that these kinds of collapses among these companies aren't likely to happen. While one might argue that certain types of companies are likely to trade closer to book value, even those that some suggest \"should\" trade at book value often don't.\n\nFor example, Annaly Capital (NLY) is a mortgage REIT that invests primarily in agency mortgage-backed securities. Agency MBS is a very liquid asset, that you can buy directly through your brokerage account. As a result, many suggest that book value should be the prime measure of valuation.\n\nHistorically, NLY has traded from 80% to 160% of book value.\n\nData by YCharts\n\nSince stock prices aren't directly tied to book value, $1/share paid in dividends could be worth more or less than $1 in share price movement. Share prices move every day, the value of a dividend in your pocket doesn't.\n\nThis isn't always a meaningful distinction. If you are in a bullish stock market and prices are always going up, then selling shares can result is very similar cash flows as a stock with identical returns that pays a dividend. If shares are trading at large premiums, then $1/share on the balance sheet might generate far more than $1/share in share price.\n\nHowever, when a bear market happens, and everything in the market is trading at a significant discount, receiving a dividend or selling shares can be the difference between you destroying your portfolio and coasting through the bear market. This is due to \"Sequence of returns\" risk.\n\nThe Magic Of Sequence Of Returns\n\nI'm going to show you a magic trick. Here is a chart of Annaly Capital (NLY) compared to Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the S&P 500 from April 1999 through June 26, 2024:\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nOn a $1,000,000 original investment, QQQ more than doubled in the following year before the dot-com bubble burst, causing it to underperform. From 2002 through 2024, QQQ caught back up and outperformed NLY.\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nSo if you could go back in a time machine and had to choose one of these holdings to buy and hold no matter what, QQQ would be your choice, right? After all, it ends with an extra $1.3 million in value. Who doesn't want an extra $1.3 million?\n\nNow for the magic trick. The same time period, the same tickers, with one small change. You see, the investor with $1 million in 1999 likely felt very good about retiring. $1 million is still a good bit of money today, but in 1999? If you were a millionaire, people thought you were set for life. So if that investor retired, and started withdrawing $40,000/year indexed to inflation (AKA \"the 4% rule\"), here is what that looks like:\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nNLY goes from slightly underperforming, to dramatically outperforming. The investor in QQQ, using the 4% withdrawal rule, has to be extremely concerned. They have $129,564 left from the original $1 million, and the 4% rule prescribes withdrawing over $75,000 in 2024. Something that clearly could not be done safely. Meanwhile, the NLY investor has $6.5 million in share value, income of over $765,000 in 2023 and is withdrawing less than 10% of the income to meet the target withdrawal.\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nHow can such a relatively small withdrawal cause such an enormous difference? Let's go back to where the wheels came off and look at the annual returns in the early years:\n\nPay attention to the value of QQQ in 2000 through 2001 without withdrawals:\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nNow compare the same numbers with cash being withdrawn:\n\nPortfolio Visualizer\n\nThe withdrawals caused the QQQ position to be worth 21.5% less by 2002, than it would have been if the funds stayed invested. In essence, the investor was forced to sell shares at poor prices. So by 2007, without withdrawals, QQQ was able to fully recover and survive the Great Financial Crisis. With withdrawals, it was only able to recover to $489k and in 2008 it was at $234k while withdrawals were approaching $51k. Forcing the selling of even more shares at low prices.\n\nTell me again how \"selling shares is no different than dividends\".\n\nSelling Low Destroys Capital\n\nIt's math. If you are selling shares at low prices, then when the price recovers you will hold fewer shares, and therefore it will take more upside to get you back to even. With an income approach, where the amount of dividends you receive is greater than your withdrawals, you are buying more shares when prices are low.\n\nThe fastest way to devastate your retirement portfolio is to be forced to sell when prices are low. The Income Method is a strategy designed to avoid ever being forced to sell shares to withdraw income. This way, you can decide to sell on your own time, at good prices.\n\nNote that dividend investments are not magic. They do not guarantee that you will get a particular dividend indefinitely. They can perform exceptionally well, or poorly. Dividends can be cut, raised, or even suspended. Also, if you withdraw more cash than is produced by your dividends, you may be forced to sell shares at poor prices, creating the same problem QQQ had above.\n\nA well-constructed income investment strategy incorporates these risks. This is why we recommend having a diversified portfolio of at least 42 income-producing investments, rather than all your investments in a single ticker. We recommend an allocation to fixed-income, which tends to be more stable. Finally, we suggest planning on reinvesting at least 25% of your dividend income, both to provide a source of income growth and also to provide a buffer in the event that we see a period of higher than average dividend cuts.\n\nWhat Dividends Are Not\n\nDividends are not \"magic money\" conjured out of thin air. They are payments paid by a company or fund to shareholders. Those payments come from cash that the company or fund acquires. Where does the company or fund get that cash? It can vary. It can vary for the same company across different payments.\n\nCash on hand: Sometimes a company might have excess cash sitting on their balance sheet. Operating cash flow: Many companies will pay dividends from the cash that is generated by their operations. Various non-GAAP metrics often aim to measure the amount of recurring cash flow being produced by the company's operations. These include FFO (Funds From Operations), AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations), FAD (Funds Available for Distribution), and CAD (Cash Available for Distribution). These metrics can often be a fantastic way to estimate the sustainability of a dividend. However, be aware that even if the metric carries the same name, the calculation may vary from company to company. It is essential that you look at the reconciliation to GAAP earnings so that you understand what adjustments have been made. If comparing two different companies, make your own adjustments so that the metrics are comparable. Investment Income: Some businesses primarily make money through investments. Mortgage REITs or BDCs are examples of companies that generate most of their earnings through investments. Capital gains: Capital gains can be sources of cash that is eventually distributed. In many cases, large capital gains are a source of one-time \"special\" dividends. However, for other investments, it might be a recurring part of their strategy. For example, CEFs (closed-end funds) are required to distribute most of their realized capital gains. So if you invest in a CEF, you can expect a significant portion of your dividends to stem from capital gains. Borrowing: A company might borrow money, usually on its revolver, to fund a dividend payment. Raising capital: Companies can raise cash from issuing common or preferred equity.\n\nWhen evaluating a dividend-paying investment, it is critical that we take the time to understand the business model of the company and where its dividends are going to be paid from.\n\nObviously, we want to avoid companies that are funding their dividends primarily through temporary or unsustainable sources like borrowing, unless we have a very clear picture for how they will achieve coverage in the future.\n\nThere is no shortcut. Using a metric to screen investments to narrow down the number of options you want to do a deep dive on can be helpful. However, you cannot rely on headline metrics to tell you how a dividend is being paid and whether or not it is safe. There are always numerous things going on within a company. They might be increasing their overall debt level to expand, but the dividend is comfortably covered by existing operations. Or a company might have significant capital gains that won't be recurring, making the dividend appear covered when it won't be in the long run.\n\nConclusion\n\nDividends aren't magic, but they are capable of performing a very incredible magic trick. They can prevent you from being forced to sell shares during a market downturn. Share prices are volatile, and they can often have very little to do with the underlying business. For those of us who are not forced to sell shares, the volatility of share prices is an advantage. We get to choose on any particular day whether we want to be a buyer or a seller.\n\nFor those who are forced to sell shares, the volatility of market prices is a great risk. Selling shares at poor prices is the greatest threat to a retirement portfolio. Unfortunately, it is something that many find themselves doing out of fear or necessity.\n\nAn income-based strategy can help deal with some of the complications created by volatile prices. We have a tangible measure of what we are getting paid. Just like with your job, you know exactly how much you got paid. Live on less.\n\nI'm not going to tell you I have the secret code to avoid losses. Life isn't a video game, there is no cheat code. Anyone who tells you they have a way to guarantee you make $X without a risk of loss, buyer beware.\n\nWhat I will tell you, is that if you take time to approach the market in a reasoned and logical manner, it can be a great generator of wealth for you. You will need to keep a level head, avoid panicking, and work to identify the best investment options for your goals.\n\nFocus on what the companies do, and how they generate cash to pay the dividend. Make your best estimate as to whether or not they will be able to continue to do that. Sometimes you might be wrong, and that is ok.\n\nFocus on building your income, and make sure you are withdrawing less. Maintain a cushion of excess dividends, and if that cushion shrinks, that is a warning sign for you to change things in your portfolio. The greatest benefit of an income strategy is that you are not faced with the decision that so many had to make in 2001/2002 on whether or not it was safe to withdraw funds. Since you aren't spending money until it is paid to you, you know the budget you have to work with, and you know if you need to do something to either increase your income or reduce your spending before it is too late.\n\nMore often than not, investors who take an income approach to the market will be surprised at just how much income their portfolio is capable of producing. They often get to enjoy the magical feeling that comes with having a lot of cash flow.",

    "title": "Better Cloud Stock: Datadog vs. PagerDuty",
    "body": "Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) and PagerDuty (NYSE: PD) both help IT teams monitor and manage their software and hardware infrastructure through cloud-based services. Datadog's platform provides IT professionals with real-time visibility into a company's infrastructure, applications, and logs through unified dashboards. That streamlined approach helps them spot potential problems before they become more serious issues. PagerDuty's platform helps IT professionals quickly respond to major incidents by organizing their on-call schedules, escalation policies, and alert mechanisms.\n\nDatadog and PagerDuty both went public in 2019. Datadog's stock has surged 388% since its IPO, but PagerDuty still trades about 8% below its debut price. Let's see why the proactive player outperformed the reactive one by such a wide margin.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nHow fast is Datadog growing?\n\nDatadog's revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67% from 2019 to 2022, while its number of large customers -- which generated at least $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR) -- more than tripled.\n\nBut in 2023, its revenue only rose 27% as its large customer base grew 15%. Its net dollar-based retention rate, which stayed above 130% in all of 2022, slipped to the mid-110s by the end of 2023. Like many of its industry peers, Datadog attributed that deceleration to the macro headwinds that drove many companies to rein in their cloud spending. But on the bright side, it turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in 2023 as it trimmed its expenses.\n\nLooking ahead, Datadog still faces fierce competition from similar platforms like Cisco's AppDynamics, Dynatrace, New Relic, LogicMonitor, Microsoft's Azure Monitor, and IBM's Instana. Its core market is also maturing: The global observability tools and platform market might only expand at a CAGR of 11.7% from 2023 to 2028, according to Markets and Markets.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Datadog's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 25% as its GAAP EPS increases at a CAGR of 85%. Those growth rates are impressive, but its stock isn't cheap at 78 times its forward adjusted earnings and 17 times this year's sales. That's probably why Datadog's only advanced about 9% this year, and why its insiders sold slightly more shares than they bought over the past 12 months.\n\nHow fast is PagerDuty growing?\n\nFrom fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023 (which ended in January 2023), PagerDuty's revenue rose at a CAGR of 30% as its total number of paying customers grew 20%. It's still unprofitable on a GAAP basis, but its non-GAAP earnings turned positive in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in fiscal 2024, PagerDuty's revenue only grew 16% as its total number of paying customers declined 1%. Its dollar-based retention rate slipped to 107% in the fourth quarter -- compared to 120% a year earlier. Like Datadog, it seems to be struggling with the tough macro headwinds for the cloud software market. But it also operates in a crowded market filled with bigger competitors like Cisco's Splunk and the digital workflow services leader ServiceNow.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect PagerDuty's revenue to increase at CAGR of only 12% as its adjusted earnings grow at a CAGR of 20%. To put that into perspective, ServiceNow generated more than 20 times as much revenue as PagerDuty last year, but it's expected to grow its revenue at a CAGR of 21% from 2023 to 2026. ServiceNow is also firmly profitable on a GAAP basis.\n\nBased on those lackluster estimates, PagerDuty's stock isn't cheap at 33 times forward earnings and 5 times this year's sales. That's probably why its stock still trades at discount to its IPO price.

    "body": "It's understandable if investors believe that to achieve outsize returns, it's necessary to find under-the-radar businesses that can grow rapidly. But this just isn't true. Compelling investment ideas could be hiding in plain sight.\n\nThere's one fantastic company whose shares have catapulted 1,090% higher in the past decade. This enterprise is currently valued at greater than $2 trillion, but I believe it still deserves a closer look.\n\nHere's the ultimate growth stock to buy with $1,000 right now, which would afford you five shares.\n\nSecular trends\n\nThe business in question is none other than Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The tech titan is one of the most well-known companies on Earth. Despite its scale, as exemplified by trailing-12-month revenue of $591 billion, there is still meaningful growth potential in the years ahead, thanks to multiple secular tailwinds.\n\nWith a whopping 38% share of all online retail sales in the U.S., Amazon is the clear leader in the e-commerce space. This has been true for a long time. The business sells virtually every product category you can think of, a far cry from the days when all it offered was books.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 84% of retail spending in this country is still represented by brick-and-mortar shopping. Amazon is in a prime position to benefit as online shopping increases its penetration rate over time.\n\nAnother growth area is streaming entertainment. The decline of traditional cable TV bundles has made way for new on-demand services to flourish. With Amazon Prime Video, which has more than 200 million members, the company has a top competitor in the so-called streaming wars.\n\nPrime Video also gives Amazon a hand in the digital ad industry. Given that the popular amazon.com site attracts billions of visitors each month, the business has opportunities to monetize this attention via advertising revenue. While Alphabet and Meta Platforms currently dominate the digital ad market, Amazon is in the third position in terms of revenue share.\n\nThe company should see healthy sales growth for a long time as it benefits from long-term tailwinds in the e-commerce, streaming, and digital ad industries.\n\nInvesting in AI\n\nAstute readers will notice that a crucial segment still hasn't been discussed. And that's Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing segment that commands industry-leading market share. It's important to understand that the shift of businesses spending more money on off-premises tech infrastructure will continue to propel Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS is a major growth engine, as sales were up 17% in the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31). Moreover, it's an extremely profitable segment, reporting an outstanding operating margin of 37.6% in Q1. The entire company's profitability can mostly be attributed to AWS.\n\nThis division also positions Amazon favorably in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. I believe that AI, regardless of how much excitement there seems to be, won't necessarily create groundbreaking new products and services. Instead, I think AI can bolster existing offerings that companies already provide to their customers.\n\nBy more aggressively leaning into AI innovation and capabilities, AWS is poised to become an even more mission-critical partner to its client base. With plans to invest $100 billion in data centers over the next 10 years to expand AI capacity, the business is positioning itself for lasting success.\n\nWhat about the valuation?\n\nDespite Amazon's monster performance historically, which has surely made some investors rich, the stock still looks reasonably valued today. This might be surprising to market observers who believe they might have missed the boat.\n\nThe company's market cap is about 20 times the company's estimated 2026 free cash flow (FCF) of about $100 billion. Because of the likelihood that FCF is poised to grow for many years, this looks like a compelling entry point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $786,046!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

    "body": "Dave Ramsey Lays Down The Law And Tells People If They Want Not To Be Broke, They Have To 'Act Their Wage'\n\nPersonal finance expert Dave Ramsey is known for his blunt advice. He has told people they need to work beyond their wages if they don't want to be broke. Here's what went down on an episode of \"The Dave Ramsey Show.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare ?\n\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?\n\nHow to turn a $100,000 investment into $1 Million \u2014 and retire a millionaire.\n\nDuring an episode of the personal finance help show, Ramsey was joined by team member Jade Warshaw as they discussed all things money. Ramsey is known for his hard-hitting advice, often delivered bluntly, and this advice he gave about broke people is certainly one of his bluntest. The episode was shared on Ramsey's social media account on X, formerly known as Twitter, and he wrote, \"Most people are broke. They spend more than they have coming in.\" He's not wrong, as the latest findings have revealed that Americans are carrying record numbers of household debts from last year.\n\nA study by MarketWatch found that at the start of 2024, household debt was at a record high of $17.3 trillion. This household debt includes auto loans, student loans, credit card loans and revolving debt. Out of all these, credit card debt increased the most between 2022 and 2023, and the state with the highest credit card debt is the District of Columbia. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Center for Microeconomic Data released its report on the rising debt, and Joelle Scally, Regional Economic Principal within the Household and Public Policy Research Division, said in the report, \"An increasing number of borrowers missed credit card payments, revealing worsening financial distress among some households.\"\n\nTrending: Will the surge continue or decline on real estate prices? People are finding out about risk-free real estate investing with just $100\n\nRamsey and Warshaw spoke about being broke and how more people are broke because of bad spending habits. During the episode, Ramsey told Warshaw, \"You make $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 per year in America today, and you do rich people stuff for the next decade, you will not be poor anymore.\" Ramsey has often told people that the best way to build wealth is to start thinking like rich people. At first, you may think this means spending lots of money on luxuries, but this is inaccurate. For Ramsey, thinking and acting like the rich means being smart with your money and acting your wage.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome ways to live like the rich include \"Paying cash for things\" and avoiding spending money on your credit card, as that's money you don't have. Ramsey once said on his show, \"Think, think, think. Seriously, so credit cards \u2014 stupid, stupid.\"\n\nRamsey also encourages buying used cars instead of new ones. During an episode of his show in January, Ramsey called out car payments, saying they're stupid. He explained that people have so many loans and are in debt because they've wasted their money on a \"stupid car payment to impress somebody at a stop light that you will never meet. And the thing\u2019s going down in value like a rock.\" He called these car payments \"stupid on steroids.\"\n\nIn addition to buying used cars, Ramsey urges viewers to avoid leasing stuff and not to \"finance your freaking vacations,\" and to \"stay out of the timeshare office.\" Thinking like rich people also means having long-term financial plans for themselves and their children. It also means living on less than you earn, prioritizing saving for your future, investing your money in things you understand, and avoiding more debt.\n\nHis biggest advice is to act on your wage: \"If you don't want to be broke anymore, figure out what most people are doing and run in the other direction.\"\n\nRead Next:\n\nGen Z and Millennial millionaires couldn't care less for stocks and bonds \u2014 Here's what they're buying instead.\n\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? \u2013 How does it compare to the average?\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Dave Ramsey Lays Down The Law And Tells People If They Want Not To Be Broke, They Have To 'Act Their Wage' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

    "title": "James Timpson: Why Starmer hired key boss as prisons minister",
    "body": "Why Starmer hired key-cutting boss as prisons minister\n\n17 hours ago By Sima Kotecha , Senior UK Correspondent , @sima_kotecha \u2022 Lucy Clarke-Billings , BBC News Share\n\nNo 10 Downing Street James Timpson is well-known for hiring former prisoners\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has appointed a CEO known for employing ex-offenders as the new prisons minister because he \"walks the walk\". James Timpson, of the Timpson Group, which provides key cutting and shoe repair services, has made a name for himself hiring hundreds of former prisoners. He previously said only a third of people in prison should be there. During his first news conference as prime minister on Saturday, Sir Keir said Mr Timpson had invested \"a huge amount over many years\" into rehabilitating offenders and he was \"very pleased\" to have given him the post. His comments came after prison governors last week warned jails could run out of space within days, putting the public in danger. Mr Timpson was not elected by the public and is not an MP but will now sit in the House of Lords, the upper chamber of parliament which scrutinises the work of the government and recommends changes to proposed legislation. Alongside running his key cutting business, the 52-year-old is the chair of UK charity the Prison Reform Trust, which aims to reduce imprisonment and improve conditions for inmates and families.\n\nEPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Sir Keir Starmer said problems with prisons will not be fixed 'overnight'\n\nNazir Afzal, former chief crown prosecutor for North West England and an advocate of the new government, called Mr Timpson's appointment \"ground-breaking\". \"We could see a significant sea change in how we deal with crime and offenders in this country,\" he said. \"We've had a culture for far too long of putting people inside who shouldn\u2019t be.\" However, former Labour home secretary David Blunkett said working in government was challenging. \"I think it\u2019s a positively good thing if [Mr Timpson] is able to navigate the minefield of government,\" he said. \"Not just to say the right thing but to really achieve positive change in a radical rethink of how we do prisons and probation.\" But some have little sympathy for criminals and believe in harsher and longer sentences. One Tory MP, who did not want to be named, said: \"The public want to see people properly punished for breaking the law but I get there needs to be a rethink.\" Last week, the Prison Governors' Association (PGA), which represents more than 95% of all prison governors and managers working in England and Wales, said the entire criminal justice system \"stands on the precipice of failure\" as it called on the next government to tackle problems \"without delay\". Mr Timpson is now the person assigned to sorting out the crisis as a matter of urgency, along with new Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood. In February, Mr Timpson spoke openly about his views on the justice system, telling Channel 4 there needed to be an overhaul. \"We\u2019re addicted to sentencing, we\u2019re addicted to punishment,\" he said. \"So many of the people in prison in my view shouldn\u2019t be there. A lot should but a lot shouldn\u2019t, and they\u2019re there for far too long.\" Asked if he agreed with Mr Timpson's remarks at Saturday's news conference, Sir Keir said: \"I've sat in the back of I don't know how many criminal courts and watched people processed through the system on an escalator to go into prison. \"And I've often reflected that many of them could have been taken out of that system earlier if they'd had support, and that is why what we want to do with our youth hubs and on knife crime is really, really important, because I want to reduce crime.\" The prime minister said \"we've got too many prisoners and not enough prisons\", calling it a \"monumental failure of the last government\". \"We'll fix [it], but we can't fix it overnight,\" he said. \"We do need to be clear about the way we use prisons and we need to get away from the fact that so many people leave prison and then are back in prison pretty quickly. \"That is a massive problem that we need to break and that's why I was very pleased to put James into the post, someone who hasn't just talked the talk, he's actually walked the walk for many years.\" He added that if young people, particularly boys, are offered support at a \"point of intervention\" in the early teenage years, it could ensure some of them \"do not get on that escalator\" to imprisonment.\n\nBBC News",

    "body": "\u201cI now do volunteer work.\u201d (Photo subject is a model.) - MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto\n\nDear MarketWatch,\n\nI\u2019m 64 and a retired cardiologist \u2014 I now do volunteer work \u2014 with a $9 million net worth, which includes a paid condo (worth about $1 million), $3 million in Treasuries and the rest in a Vanguard index fund.\n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of living in a condo and would like to own a \u2018forever\u2019 home. Good idea? What is the maximum should I safely spend assuming I live into my 80s?\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\nCardiologist in a Condo\n\nSee: My spouse and I are 60 and receive $145,000 a year in pensions. Do we need to worry about inflation killing our retirement plans?\n\nDear Cardiologist,\n\nBased on your net worth, it\u2019s fair to say that you are in a prime position to buy your forever home, but just as with anyone looking to make a home purchase, there\u2019s much for you to consider before signing the papers.\n\nIf you\u2019re not happy with a condo and you can afford to buy a \u201cforever home\u201d that fits your dreams, then that\u2019s what you should do. You\u2019re only 64, and could have decades left in retirement \u2014 find the right house and neighborhood where you can thrive in your retirement.\n\nBe mindful of your money though. Even with such an impressive portfolio, you don\u2019t want to put a significant portion of your net worth into the home, because you do need to live off of your money into your older age and many expenses can pop up during that time.\n\nWhen there\u2019s so much money available to use, it is easy to get wrapped up in infinite possibilities. Unfortunately, people in these scenarios sometimes overextend themselves, and when an emergency strikes they haven\u2019t any money to fall back on. They too quickly spend down their assets, and find themselves in an uncomfortable situation.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you for sure what is the maximum you should safely spend for this house, but you can figure it out with some calculations on your own. (Of course, a financial planner can help you with this sort of purchase, too, but you can at least start on your own to get an idea of what you need).\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, look around at the type of house you want, the amenities it would have, and the neighborhood you\u2019d live in. Perhaps pick a few houses you like right now on the market \u2014 some on the cheaper side, some on the higher-end side \u2014 and price them out.\n\nEstimate the mortgage payments based on various levels of down payment (if you chose to go that route), plus the property taxes and utilities. I always err on the side of more than less when making estimates like this because you don\u2019t want to get too many surprise bills, even if you have the cash flow.\n\nFactor in HOA fees for the neighborhood. If there are any clubs or other sources of entertainment you\u2019d regularly frequent, like a golf course or a country club or some sort of arts center, add that to the mock budget. And incorporate all of your other monthly expenses, including groceries, auto payments, nights out, healthcare and whatever else that is important to you. Get extremely granular when you run the numbers: even the amount you would pay for gas to drive to your volunteer job, plus magazine and television subscriptions.\n\nCompare that mock budget to what you expect to spend in retirement. That\u2019s a number no one could really know for sure, but you can work around it. Some people use the 4% rule, which is where you draw down 4% on the initial amount of your retirement savings to fund your annual expenses. Doing so gives you a rough idea of how not to run out of your money within 30 years. Of course, that rule of thumb isn\u2019t for everyone \u2014 some people are much more comfortable on less, while others would need more. Ask yourself where you fit in.\n\nAlso consider inflation rates, and what, if anything, you\u2019d get from Social Security to offset your monthly outflow. You can get more specific estimates for your Social Security benefits by making an online account with the Social Security Administration, where you can review your earnings history.\n\nIf you have no major debts and you live a reasonable lifestyle, you are in good financial standing to buy a forever home. And after working so hard, there\u2019s little argument why you shouldn\u2019t be able to do so. Just make sure that you don\u2019t overdo it and put your older self is in jeopardy.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch",

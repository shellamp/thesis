    "title": "Pope Francis, pontiff who pushed church boundaries \u2014 but didn\u2019t break them",
    "body": "The pope, who pushed for a less opaque Vatican and connected to common and marginalised people\u2019s concerns, died aged 88.\n\nPope Francis, the Argentinian pontiff who brought the plight of the world\u2019s most marginalised back to the centre of the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s attention, has died aged 88, the Vatican announced on Monday.\n\nA charismatic communicator with a friendly demeanour, Francis succeeded in broadening Catholicism\u2019s appeal at a time of growing disenchantment towards the Church, an institution embroiled in financial and sexual scandals.\n\nThroughout his papacy from 2013 to 2025, the pope stripped the Vatican of some layers of opacity and connected with the concerns of common people. He highlighted the plight of the poor and that of prisoners.\n\nFrancis condemned the Church\u2019s abuse of power while engaging with other faiths.\n\nFrancis\u2019s tone marked a radical departure from his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who believed that nurturing the Church\u2019s most ardent believers was the way to strengthen the institution.\n\nBut Francis\u2019s shift never translated into fundamental changes to the Church\u2019s doctrine on contentious issues. In most instances, he remained in line with previous papacies, staunchly opposing gay marriage, women becoming priests and priests marrying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, his steps to open up the Church drew the ire of traditionalists, while the lack of radical change under his watch drew criticism from progressives.\n\nReligious pluralism and inequality\n\nFrancis was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in 1936 in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, to immigrant parents who fled Italy\u2019s fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini.\n\nHe trained as a chemical technician, worked in the food processing industry, and, for a brief time, was a bouncer in a nightclub in Cordoba before becoming a priest in 1969.\n\nHe liked to dance tango, although he preferred milonga, Francis said in a 2010 interview, referring to the faster-paced music that preceded tango.\n\nHis upbringing in Buenos Aires exposed him to religious pluralism and socioeconomic inequalities \u2013 two factors that experts believe explain his commitment to interfaith dialogue and pointed criticism of capitalism and consumerism.\n\nAt just 36 years of age, he became the head of Argentina\u2019s Jesuits, a Roman Catholic order of priests.\n\nBack then, he was a stern disciplinarian, experts and biographers say. At the time, liberation theology, a left-wing interpretation of the Gospel that centred on concern for the poor and oppressed groups, was popular among Jesuits in Latin America, but Francis did not subscribe to the ideology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirty War\n\nFrancis\u2019s tenure then coincided with the years of Argentina\u2019s Dirty War, which lasted from 1976 to 1983 \u2013 seven years of brutal military dictatorship.\n\nTens of thousands of people were tortured, killed and disappeared. The role of Argentina\u2019s Church in those years remains contentious, with Francis never openly denouncing the regime.\n\nAs archbishop of Buenos Aires, a position he assumed in 1998, he said he was not aware of the scale of what was happening in the late 1970s \u2013 a position refuted by critics and associates who argue that there was no way he could not have known at the time.\n\n\u201cLet us pray \u2026 for the complicit silence of most of society and of the Church,\u201d he said during a ceremony in 1999, a quote some read as an admission of complacency.\n\nDuring his time as archbishop, he would become an outspoken critic of social injustice and economic inequality.\n\n\u201cThe Church can\u2019t just sit sucking its finger when faced with a frivolous, cold and calculating market economy,\u201d he once said during a sermon.\n\nBreaking with tradition\n\nIn 2013, the Catholic world was shocked when the then-Pope Benedict XVI resigned, breaking a centuries-old tradition of holding papal duties until death.\n\nFrancis, who by then had been elected cardinal, rushed to the Vatican to vote for a new pope.\n\nIn what was a tight race, Francis, who had already been a runner-up in the previous papal conclave in 2005, was elected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith him, the Church chose its first non-European pontiff in 1,282 years \u2013 the last one was Gregory III, elected in 731 from Syria \u2013 and also its first leader since then from the Global South, which today is home to the majority of Christians worldwide.\n\nFrancis set the tone of his papacy immediately. When he stood on the large balcony and faced the huge crowd in Saint Peter\u2019s Square after being elected, he broke with the tradition of blessing the crowd, asking people instead to pray for him.\n\nHe refused to move to the grand papal apartment on the top floor of the Vatican palace, opting to stay in the more modest Domus Sanctae Marthae residence. He preferred to be driven around in a Fiat rather than a Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\u201cBe shepherds with the smell of sheep,\u201d he told a crowd of priests in 2013, urging a departure from the pomp and splendour often associated with the clergy\u2019s top hierarchy.\n\nOn his first trip outside Rome as pope, he travelled to Lampedusa, an Italian island and key point of entry for migrants and refugees trying to reach Europe. He threw a crown of flowers into the sea to commemorate the people who died in the Mediterranean Sea while risking their lives to come to Europe.\n\nFrancis criticised then-US President Donald Trump\u2019s plan in 2017 to build a wall along the Mexican border and his speeches targeting Muslims.\n\n\u201cIn Pope Francis, the message that \u2018everybody is brothers and sisters\u2019 is very strong, along with insisting that God pushes for religious pluralism,\u201d said Marco Politi, a Vatican expert and author of the book Pope Francis Among the Wolves: The Inside Story of a Revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch pluralism translated into a more inclusive approach towards other religions, Politi said, putting an end to the \u201cculture war of previous papacies\u201d.\n\nFrom the Vatican to the Arabian Peninsula\n\nTies between the Church and Muslims around the world had soured when Francis\u2019s predecessor, Benedict XVI, made a speech in September 2006 that was perceived as linking Islam to violence.\n\nFrancis became the first pontiff ever to travel to the Arabian Peninsula. In February 2019, he landed in the United Arab Emirates, where he met Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand imam of Cairo\u2019s Al-Azhar Mosque.\n\nTogether, they signed a document rejecting religious fundamentalism, exhorting people to see in the other a \u201cbrother to support and love\u201d. The pope had also met el-Tayeb previously, in 2016, at the Vatican.\n\nIn another first, Francis, in 2015, published the encyclical Laudato si\u2019 (Praise be to you), in which he urged the world to address the threat of climate change while also stressing the need to rethink the economic balance between the industrialised and developing worlds.\n\nResponse to sexual abuse in the Church\n\nThe issue of sexual abuses perpetrated by Church officials dominated the tenure of Benedict XVI, whose papacy saw a wave of scandals.\n\nFrancis began addressing the issue of abuse in 2019 by abolishing the rule of \u201cpontifical secrecy\u201d on cases related to sexual violence.\n\nThis meant that testimonies collected in the canonical process were finally made available to legal authorities.\n\nThat same year, after the pope himself admitted to having dismissed valid claims of sexual abuse in Chile, he introduced a law outlining clear rules for reporting child sexual abuse committed by Church officials and attempts to cover it up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour years later, that rule was updated and strengthened to widen the category of victims to vulnerable adults, while laypeople working for the Church could also now face punishment. But victims\u2019 advocates and critics say Francis did not go far enough to ensure justice.\n\n\u2018Who am I to judge?\u2019\n\nFrancis drastically changed the tone of the Church towards homosexuality, ending the Vatican\u2019s long demonisation of gay people.\n\n\u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d he famously said in 2013, his words a stark contrast to those of Pope John Paul II, who more than 10 years earlier called a gay rights march in Rome \u201can offence to Christian values\u201d.\n\nMore recently, on his way back from a trip to South Sudan, Francis said being gay was not a crime.\n\nHe expressed support for same-sex civil unions. In 2023, he hinted that he was open to reviewing the practice of celibacy.\n\nIn December 2023, the Vatican, in a landmark ruling, decided that Catholic priests would be able to administer blessings to same-sex couples, provided these were not given in the context of civil unions or weddings or Church liturgies.\n\nAt the same time, the pontiff remained opposed to gay marriage and abortion, and while he included women in the Vatican\u2019s government, he always ruled out their becoming priests.\n\nThroughout his papacy, Francis often found himself under attack from both conservative and progressive camps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose following the traditional doctrine saw him as too much of a reformer and a socialist, while those seeking deeper changes within the Church did not consider him bold enough.\n\nPoliti, the Vatican expert, argues that Francis\u2019s decision not to make changes that were too radical stemmed from an understanding that this would have torn apart an already much-divided Church. Instead, he says, Francis opted \u201cto trigger processes of transformation in its mentality through gestures and words\u201d.",

Israel will also only promise to discuss ending its genocidal war on Gaza if Hamas agrees to disarm and exile up to 200 of its members from the Strip,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHamas has shown flexibility on many issues, but the movement says laying down its arms without ending the occupation is a red line. But Hamas is running out of options. Gaza is in ruins. People are running out of hope and patience,\u201d Odeh added.\n\nIsraeli forces have taken over large areas of Gaza in recent weeks.

    "body": "Right-wing incumbent has four-year term to implement promises to clamp down on crime and improve economy.\n\nEcuador\u2019s right-wing President Daniel Noboa has been re-elected in a second-round election run-off.\n\nThe National Electoral Council declared late on Sunday that the incumbent, who has promised to boost the flagging economy and continue a crackdown on cartel violence, had won by a wide margin.\n\nWith more than 90 percent of ballots counted, the 37-year-old Noboa was reported to have taken 55.8 percent of the vote. That gave him a twelve-point lead over left-wing opponent Luisa Gonzalez.\n\nHowever, his rival, whose support polls had suggested was running close to the incumbent\u2019s, has demanded a recount, claiming the vote was fraudulent.\n\nNoboa, who was elected in snap elections in 2023, now has a full four-year mandate in which to continue his divisive \u201cmano dura\u201d (tough) crackdown on violence tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighbouring Colombia and Peru. The smuggling and associated criminality has blighted Ecuador since 2021.\n\n\u201cEcuadorians have spoken. From tomorrow morning, we will go to work,\u201d Noboa told supporters during a brief speech in his hometown of Olon. He also criticised his opponent\u2019s fraud allegations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGonzalez, who may have been penalised at the polls for her close ties to populist firebrand ex-President Rafael Correa, told chanting supporters that the result was \u201cthe worst and most grotesque electoral fraud in the history of Ecuador\u201d.\n\nThe results came as a surprise to many after the first round in February, in which Noboa finished just 16,746 votes ahead of Gonzalez.

World leaders are expected to attend the ceremony in advance of a conclave to elect the next head of the Catholic Church.\n\nAll cardinals currently in Rome were summoned to the meeting to outline the funeral arrangements and start preparations for the succession.\n\nThe funeral ceremony will take place in front of St Peter\u2019s Basilica, with the dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, leading the service. The pope\u2019s body will then be taken to the Basilica of St Mary Major in Rome and laid to rest.\n\nAs well as agreeing the timing of the funeral, the cardinals decreed that the body of the pontiff will be taken to St Peter\u2019s Basilica on Wednesday morning at 07:00 GMT for public viewing. Francis is currently laid out in a coffin in the chapel of the Santa Marta residence where he lived during his 12-year papacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Vatican said in a statement that Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, the camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, will preside over a prayer, after which the coffin will undertake a short itinerary that will culminate with entering the Basilica through its central door.\n\nThe camerlengo will then preside over a liturgy at the altar, at the end of which it will be possible for the public to begin paying their respects to Pope Francis\u2019s body.\n\nFrancis died aged 88 on Monday following a stroke and cardiac arrest, the Vatican said, bringing an end to a 12-year papacy defined by advocacy for the marginalised and at times clashes with traditionalist forces in the Church.\n\nHaving spent five weeks in hospital earlier this year with double pneumonia, the pope had returned to his modest Casa Santa Marta residence nearly a month ago and appeared to be on the mend.

    "title": "Trump-China tariff war: Who\u2019s winning so far?",
    "body": "It\u2019s early days, but the warning signs are flashing red for the US.\n\nAfter United States President Donald Trump suspended his \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on major US trading partners on April 9, he ramped them up on China\u2019s goods. US trade levies on most imports from China have climbed to 145 percent. Beijing retaliated with duties of its own, at 125 percent on US goods.\n\nTrump has long accused China of exploiting the US on trade, casting his tariffs as necessary to revive domestic manufacturing and reshore jobs back to the US. He also wants to use tariffs to finance tax cuts. Most economists remain sceptical Trump will achieve his aims.\n\nFor now, the US and China are locked in a high-stakes game of chicken. The world is waiting to see which country will yield and which will stay the course. As Trump nears his first 100 days in office for the second time, here\u2019s where the tariff war with China stands:\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with negotiations?\n\nTrump recently played up the possibility of securing a trade deal with China. Last week, the US president said his tariffs on China will \u201ccome down substantially\u201d in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a fair deal with China,\u201d Trump told reporters on April 23, stirring hopes of a de-escalation. He also said his administration was \u201cactively\u201d negotiating with the Chinese side without elaborating.\n\nOn April 24, however, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce rebuffed president Trump\u2019s remarks, saying there were no talks taking place between the two countries.\n\n\u201cAny claims about the progress of China-US economic and trade negotiations are groundless and have no factual basis,\u201d ministry spokesman He Yadong said.\n\nWhile he insisted that Beijing won\u2019t duck any economic blows from Washington, he also said the door was \u201cwide open\u201d for talks.\n\nLast week, the Reuters news agency reported that China was evaluating exemptions for select US imports \u2013 a list of up to 131 products.\n\nBeijing has not made any public statement on the issue.\n\nHas the tariff war impacted US exports?\n\nTrump introduced his sweeping tariffs on China less than three weeks ago. The fallout for US businesses won\u2019t be fully felt until later this year. Still, the warning signals are already flashing red.\n\nData from the US Department of Agriculture shows that exports of soya beans \u2013 the biggest US farm export \u2013 fell dramatically for the period April 11-17, the first full week of reporting since Trump\u2019s China tariff announcement.\n\nBy April 17, net sales of US soya beans dropped by 50 percent compared with the previous week. That was driven by a 67 percent fall in weekly soya bean exports to China, which, until recently, was America\u2019s biggest export destination for the legume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Piergiuseppe Fortunato, an adjunct professor of economics at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland, \u201cChina\u2019s retaliatory tariffs will hit US farmers hard. Some may go out of business.\u201d He added that all sectors with exposure to China would come under strain.\n\nIn 2023, the US exported roughly $15bn of oil, gas and coal to China. Losing that market would hit US energy firms.\n\nAre imports to the US going to take a hit?\n\nSince the start of Trump\u2019s tariff war, cargo shipments have plummeted. According to Linerlytica, a shipping data provider, Chinese freight bookings bound for the US fell by 30 to 60 percent in April.\n\nThe drastic reduction in shipping from America\u2019s third largest trading partner \u2013 after Canada and Mexico \u2013 has not yet been felt. In May, however, thousands of companies will need to restock their inventories.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg News, retail giants Walmart and Target told Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could roll out to Christmas.\n\nElectronic appliances, such as TV sets and washing machines, made up 46.4 percent of US imports from China in 2022. The US also imports a lot of its clothing and pharmaceutical product ingredients from China. The price of these goods will begin to rise from next month.\n\nOn April 22, the International Monetary Fund raised its US inflation forecast to 3 percent in 2025, owing to tariffs \u2013 a full 1 percentage point higher than in January. The lender also lowered its US economic growth forecast and raised its expectation that the US will tip into recession this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow will China\u2019s economy be affected?\n\nDespite growing tensions between the US and China, Washington and Beijing remain major trading partners.\n\nAccording to the Office of the US Trade Representative, the US imported $438.9bn in Chinese goods last year.\n\nThat amounts to roughly 3 percent of China\u2019s total economic output, which remains heavily reliant on exports.\n\nIn a report shared with its clients this month, Goldman Sachs said it expects Trump\u2019s tariffs to drag down China\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 2.4 percentage points.\n\nFor their part, China\u2019s top officials said the country can do without American farm and energy imports and promised to achieve a 5 percent GDP growth target for this year.\n\nZhao Chenxin, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that together with non-US imports, domestic farm and energy production would be enough to satisfy demand.\n\n\u201cEven if we do not purchase feed grains and oilseeds from the United States, it will not have much impact on our country\u2019s grain supply,\u201d Zhao said on Monday.\n\nHe also noted there would be limited impact on China\u2019s energy supplies if companies stopped importing US fossil fuels.\n\nIn some ways, experts said, China has been preparing for this crisis.\n\nFortunato told Al Jazeera: \u201cThe US is one of China\u2019s biggest export markets, so tariffs will slow GDP growth. But Beijing has played this smartly as it began diversifying its imports away from the US during the first Trump trade war\u201d in 2018.\n\nHe also pointed out that \u201cthe US depends on China for up to 60 percent of its critical mineral imports, used in everything from clean energy to military technology. The opposite flow simply isn\u2019t there, so the US is more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCould the US lose its geopolitical standing?\n\nTrump has made little secret of his wish to conscript US allies into a trade war. The administration said it aims to strike free trade deals with the European Union, Great Britain and Japan.\n\nMore generally, reports suggest that Washington is asking trade partners to loosen their economic ties with China as a pre-condition for securing relief from Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.\n\nNevertheless, US allies seem largely opposed to any economic showdown with China. Last week, the European Commission said it has no intention of \u201cdecoupling\u201d from China.\n\nElsewhere, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves recently told the Daily Telegraph newspaper: \u201cChina is the second biggest economy in the world, and it would be, I think, very foolish to not engage.\u201d\n\nMany countries are not in a position to abandon their trade ties with Beijing. The EU, in particular, has a huge trade deficit with China. Cutting off access to Chinese goods \u2013 both consumer products and inputs for industry \u2013 would bruise its already sluggish economy.\n\nAcross the developing world, China\u2019s trade role is equally as crucial. Roughly a quarter of Bangladesh\u2019s and Cambodia\u2019s imports come from China. Nigeria and Saudi Arabia are similarly dependent on Beijing for their goods imports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see why countries would want to undermine their own business interests to try and reduce America\u2019s trade deficit with China,\u201d Fortunato said. \u201cOn this point, I think Trump has been short-sighted and may be forced to blink first on lowering tariffs with China.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs Trump losing his grip on Republican voters?\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party doesn\u2019t need to worry about its next election cycle. Trump\u2019s Republican Party does, so Beijing has the political upper hand in Trump\u2019s trade war. Simply put, it has more time on its side.\n\nFor Trump\u2019s party, his sabre rattling already looks politically costly. A new Economist-YouGov poll shows Americans reporting Trump\u2019s economic actions have hurt them personally more than they\u2019ve helped by a 30-point margin.\n\nAnd public approval of the president\u2019s economic management has been low for a while: It had fallen to 37 percent in a Reuters-Ipsos poll published on March 31, his lowest score ever in that survey.\n\nIf Trump stays the course, it is likely that his approval ratings might fall still lower, jeopardising the Republican Party\u2019s fragile grip on the US House of Representatives \u2013 and possibly the Senate, experts said.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons\u201d, Fortunato said, \u201cChina does not feel compelled to rush to the negotiating table to secure a trade deal. That will probably fall to Trump.\u201d",

made up 464 percent of us imports from china in 2022 the us also imports a lot of its clothing and pharmaceutical product ingredients from china the price of these goods will begin to rise from next month on april 22 the international monetary fund raised its us inflation forecast to 3 percent in 2025 owing to tariffs \u2013 a full 1 percentage point higher than in january the lender also lowered its us economic growth forecast and raised its expectation that the us will tip into recession this year advertisement how will china\u2019s economy be affected despite growing tensions between the us and china washington and beijing remain major trading partners according to the office of the us trade representative the us imported 4389bn in chinese goods last year that amounts to roughly 3

china\u2019s gross domestic product gdp by as much as 24 percentage points for their part china\u2019s top officials said the country can do without american farm and energy imports and promised to achieve a 5 percent gdp growth target for this year zhao chenxin vice chairman of the national development and reform commission said that together with nonus imports domestic farm and energy production would be enough to satisfy demand \u201ceven if we do not purchase feed grains and oilseeds from the united states it will not have much impact on our country\u2019s grain supply\u201d zhao said on monday he also noted there would be limited impact on china\u2019s energy supplies if companies stopped importing us fossil fuels in some ways experts said china has been preparing for this crisis fortunato told al jazeera \u201cthe us is one of china\u2019s biggest export markets so tariffs will slow gdp growth but beijing has played this smartly as it began diversifying its imports away from the us during the first trump trade war\u201d in 2018 he also pointed out that \u201cthe us depends on china for up to 60 percent of its critical mineral imports used in everything from clean energy to military technology the opposite flow simply isn\u2019t there so the us is more vulnerable\u201d advertisement could the us lose its geopolitical standing trump has made little secret of his wish to conscript us allies into a trade war the administration said it aims to strike free trade deals with the european union great britain and japan more generally reports suggest that washington is asking trade partners to loosen their economic ties with china as a precondition for securing relief from trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs nevertheless us allies seem largely

    "title": "Have scientists discovered a new colour called \u2018olo\u2019?",
    "body": "Described as a \u2018deeply saturated teal\u2019 colour, humans can only see it with the help of laser technology.\n\nA team of scientists claims to have discovered a new colour that humans cannot see without the help of technology.\n\nThe researchers based in the United States said they were able to \u201cexperience\u201d the colour, which they named \u201colo\u201d, by firing laser pulses into their eyes using a device named after the Wizard of Oz.\n\nOlo cannot be seen with the naked eye, but the five people who have seen it describe it as being similar to teal.\n\nWhat has the study found?\n\nProfessors from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Washington School of Medicine published an article in the journal, Science Advances, on April 18 in which they put forth their discovery of a hue beyond the gamut of human vision.\n\nThey explained that they had devised a technique called Oz, which can \u201ctrick\u201d the human eye into seeing olo. The technique is named after the Wizard of Oz.\n\nIn the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in 1900, Frank Baum wrote about a man who uses tricks to fool the residents of the fictional land of Oz into thinking he\u2019s a wizard. For instance, it is believed that the Emerald City, the capital of Oz, is so bright and vibrant that visitors have to wear special glasses to protect their eyes. The glasses are one of the wizard\u2019s tricks, since they make the city appear greener and grander.\n\nHow do humans perceive colour?\n\nThe human eye perceives colour via three types of photoreceptor or \u201ccone cells\u201d in the retina. S cones pick up shorter, blue wavelengths of light; M cones detect medium, green wavelengths; and L cones detect longer, red wavelengths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe signals from these cones are then sent through a complex series of cells in the retina that act to clean up and integrate the signal before passing it down the optic nerve through parts of the brain,\u201d Francis Windram, a research associate at the department of life sciences at Imperial College London, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe part of the brain that the visual information is passed to is the visual cortex.\n\nHow did scientists find the \u2018new\u2019 colour?\n\nIn normal vision, the function of M cones overlaps with the neighbouring S and L cones, so any light that stimulates M cones also activates the other two cones. The M cones don\u2019t function alone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no wavelength in the world that can stimulate only the M cone,\u201d Ren Ng, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley, explained in an article published on its website.\n\n\u201cI began wondering what it would look like if you could just stimulate all the M cone cells. Would it be like the greenest green you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d\n\nSo Ng teamed up with Austin Roorda, one of the creators of the Oz technology and a professor of optometry and vision science at UC Berkeley.\n\nOz, which Roorda described as \u201ca microscope for looking at the retina\u201d, uses tiny microdoses of laser light to target individual photoreceptors in the eye. The equipment, which must be highly stabilised during use, is already being used to study eye disease.\n\nThe work using Oz began in 2018 by James Carl Fong, a doctoral student in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. Hannah Doyle, another doctoral student at Berkeley, ran the experiments through which human subjects were able to see the new colour, olo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs olo really a new colour?\n\nThe shade of olo has always existed, it just falls beyond the spectrum of shades visible to the human eye. There are other such shades that we cannot see. Hence, olo is not a new colour that has come into existence, from a physical or scientific perspective.\n\nHowever, \u201cfrom a sociolinguistic perspective, if people give new names to colours which previously were indistinguishable thanks to this technology, then maybe! It all depends on how you say it,\u201d Windram said.\n\nHow many people have seen olo?\n\nFive people have seen the \u201cnew\u201d colour \u2013 four men and one woman. All had normal colour vision.\n\nThree of the subjects, including Roorda and Ng, are the co-authors of the research paper while the other two are members of the participating lab at the University of Washington and were unaware of the purpose of the study before they took part.\n\nWhat does olo look like?\n\nThose who have seen olo describe it as a teal or green-blue colour \u2013 but one they had never seen before.\n\nIn the article by UC Berkeley, it is described as a \u201cblue-green colour of unparalleled saturation\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was like a profoundly saturated teal \u2026 the most saturated natural colour was just pale by comparison,\u201d Roorda said.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a subject for this paper, but I\u2019ve seen olo since, and it\u2019s very striking. You know you\u2019re looking at something very blue-green,\u201d Doyle said.\n\nThe researchers said an image of a teal square is the closest colour match to olo. However, this square is not an olo-coloured square. The naked human eye simply cannot see the shade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you start with the colour in that picture, and imagine dialling up the saturation further you would get to the teal of real peacock feathers, further still would be a laser in the teal wavelength, and far beyond that is olo, outside the natural space of human colors,\u201d Ng told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to see olo on any smartphone displays or any TVs any time soon. And this is very, very far beyond VR headset technology,\u201d Ng said, according to a report in the UK\u2019s Guardian newspaper.\n\nCould this technology help people with colour blindness?\n\nBerkeley researchers are exploring whether the Oz technology could help people with colour blindness.\n\n\u201cWe are now studying the science of boosting the colour dimensionality of signals going from the eye to the brain,\u201d Ng said. \u201cIf it proves possible for a colour blind person to see full colour, the next question is whether a person with full colour could be boosted to yet a higher dimension of colour called tetrachromacy.\u201d\n\nThis could contain colours beyond the rainbow that would need new names. Ng said that this is part of an ongoing scientific inquiry.\n\nWindram said success would depend on the cause of colourblindness in individuals. Deuteranomaly, which causes decreased sensitivity to green light, is the most common form of colour blindness.\n\n\u201cIn this case, a miniaturised version of this technology could theoretically be used to correct this by directly stimulating the cones when the correct colour of light hits them,\u201d Windram said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWindram pointed out that publicity materials for the research show images of the Oz experiment on a highly stabilised table.\n\n\u201cThis would require a lot of work to miniaturise the technology, and is likely a long way off. Given that the laser must stably hit the correct cones in order to stimulate them, this may not really be feasible as a form of vision correction technologically,\u201d he said.\n\nHow do we know how people \u2018see\u2019 colour?\n\nThe concept of a colour has three main components, Windram explained: The physical, which has to do with the wavelengths of light that meet the eye; the neurological, which refers to how humans biologically process these light signals; and the societal or linguistic component, which pertains to how colours are named.\n\n\u201cIn the end I may see a colour and call it \u2018red\u2019, someone else may call it \u2018rot\u2019 or \u2018rouge\u2019 \u2026 but also another may look at it a bit more closely and say \u2018well it\u2019s claret\u2019 or \u2018crimson\u2019.\u201d\n\nTo test this, neuroscience and AI researcher Patrick Mineault developed a website for entertainment purposes in September 2024, on which users can take a test to see how their colour perception compares to others.\n\nHumans can also perceive colour differently due to differences in factors such as \u201ctemperature\u201d of light. This was demonstrated when a photo of a dress went viral in 2015, dividing social media users over whether the dress was white and gold, or blue and black.\n\nWindram explained that people who were deciding what colours the dress was were drawing on preconceived notions of whether the photograph of the dress was taken in warm lighting or cool lighting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo animals see colour differently from humans?\n\nYes, different species can experience colours differently.\n\nFor example, humans process three wavelengths corresponding to red, blue and green light, while the mantis shrimp, a tiny crustacean, can visually perceive 12 channels of colour instead of three. An article by the Australian Academy of Science explains that the mantis shrimp can also detect ultraviolet and polarised light, which humans cannot see.\n\nHowever, while the human eye can mix two colours and perceive an in-between shade \u2013 such as purple as a mix of red and blue \u2013 the mantis shrimp\u2019s eyes cannot mix colour receptors.\n\nMeanwhile, dogs only have two types of cones and can mostly only see shades of yellow and blue.",

paper while the other two are members of the participating lab at the university of washington and were unaware of the purpose of the study before they took part what does olo look like those who have seen olo describe it as a teal or greenblue colour \u2013 but one they had never seen before in the article by uc berkeley it is described as a \u201cbluegreen colour of unparalleled saturation\u201d \u201cit was like a profoundly saturated teal \u2026 the most saturated natural colour was just pale by comparison\u201d roorda said \u201ci wasn\u2019t a subject for this paper but i\u2019ve seen olo since and it\u2019s very striking you know you\u2019re looking at something very bluegreen\u201d doyle said the researchers said an image of a teal square is the closest colour match to olo however this square is not an olocoloured square the naked human eye simply cannot see the shade advertisement \u201cif you start with the colour in that picture and imagine dialling up the saturation further you would get to the teal of real peacock feathers further still would be a laser in the teal wavelength and far beyond that is olo outside the natural space of human colors\u201d ng told al jazeera \u201cwe\u2019re not going to see olo on any smartphone displays or any tvs any time soon and this is very very far beyond vr headset technology\u201d ng said according to a report in the uk\u2019s guardian newspaper could this technology help people with colour blindness berkeley researchers are exploring whether the oz technology could help people with colour blindness \u201cwe are now studying the science of boosting the colour dimensionality of signals going from the eye to the brain\u201d ng said \u201cif it proves possible for a colour blind person to see full colour the next question is whether a person with full colour could be boosted to yet a higher dimension of colour called tetrachromacy\u201d this could contain colours beyond the rainbow that would need new names ng said that this is part of an ongoing scientific inquiry windram said success would depend on the cause of colourblindness in individuals deuteranomaly which causes decreased sensitivity to green light is the most common form of colour blindness \u201cin this case a miniaturised version of this technology could theoretically be used to correct this by directly stimulating the cones when the correct colour of light hits them\u201d windram said advertisement windram pointed out that publicity materials for the research show images of the oz experiment on a highly stabilised table \u201cthis would require a lot of work to miniaturise the technology and is likely a long way off given that the laser must stably hit the correct cones in order to stimulate them this may not really be feasible as a form of vision correction technologically\u201d he said how do we know how people \u2018see\u2019 colour the concept of a colour has three main components windram explained the physical which has to do with the wavelengths of light that meet the eye the neurological which refers to how humans biologically process these light signals and the societal or linguistic component which pertains to how colours are named \u201cin the end i may see a colour and call it \u2018red\u2019 someone else may call it \u2018rot\u2019 or \u2018rouge\u2019 \u2026 but also another may look at it a bit more closely and say \u2018well it\u2019s claret\u2019 or \u2018crimson\u2019\u201d to test this neuroscience and ai researcher patrick mineault developed a website for entertainment purposes in september 2024 on which users can take a test to see how their colour perception compares to others humans can also perceive colour differently due to differences in factors such as \u201ctemperature\u201d of light this was demonstrated when a photo of a dress went viral in 2015 dividing social media users over whether the dress was white and gold or blue and black windram explained that people who were deciding what colours the dress was were drawing on preconceived notions of whether the photograph of the dress was taken in warm lighting or cool lighting advertisement do animals see colour differently from humans yes different species can experience colours differently for example humans process three wavelengths corresponding to red blue and green light while the mantis shrimp a tiny crustacean can visually perceive 12 channels of colour instead of three an article by the australian academy of science explains that the mantis shrimp can also detect ultraviolet and polarised light which humans cannot see however while the human eye can mix two colours and perceive an inbetween shade \u2013 such as purple as a mix of red and blue \u2013 the mantis shrimp\u2019s eyes cannot mix colour receptors meanwhile dogs only have two types of cones and can mostly only see shades of yellow and blue",
    "summary": "A team of scientists claims to have discovered a new colour that humans cannot see without the help of technology.\nThey explained that they had devised a technique called Oz, which can \u201ctrick\u201d the human eye into seeing olo.\nThe human eye perceives colour via three types of photoreceptor or \u201ccone cells\u201d in the retina.\nHannah Doyle, another doctoral student at Berkeley, ran the experiments through which human subjects were able to see the new colour, olo.\nThose who have seen olo describe it as a teal or green-blue colour \u2013 but one they had never seen before.",

His body will be cremated and \u201cno public ceremony will take place\u201d, in accordance with his wishes and instructions, his family said.\n\n\u201cHis departure will sadden his relatives, his friends and his readers around the world, but we hope that they will find comfort, as we do, in the fact that he enjoyed a long, adventurous and fruitful life, and leaves behind him a body of work that will outlive him,\u201d his eldest son Alvaro wrote in a message on X, also signed by his siblings Gonzalo and Morgana Vargas Llosa, on Sunday.\n\nIt is with deep sorrow that we announce that our father, Mario Vargas LLosa, passed away peacefully in Lima today, surrounded by his family.@morganavll pic.twitter.com/c6HgEfyaIe \u2014 \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa (@AlvaroVargasLl) April 14, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVargas Llosa was a leading light in the 20th-century Latin American literature boom, which also included Colombian Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2010 for works like Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, Death in the Andes, and The War of the End of the World.\n\nBorn to middle-class parents in Arequipa, Peru, on March 28, 1936, Vargas Llosa frequently drew from personal experience and his family, at times inserting characters based on his own life into his tales.\n\nHis acclaimed debut novel, The Time of the Hero (1963), was loosely based on his teenage life as a cadet at a military academy in Lima, while his 1993 memoir, A Fish in the Water, focused on his 1990 presidential run.\n\nOther works expressed deep concern for his country. The Storyteller (1987) deals with the clash of Indigenous and European cultures in Peru, while Death in the Andes (1993) recounts the haunting and bloody years of the Shining Path hardline movement.\n\n\u201cAn author\u2019s work is fed by his own experience and, over the years, becomes richer,\u201d Vargas Llosa told the Reuters news agency in an interview in Madrid in 2001.\n\nThe Nobel Committee said in 2010 it was awarding him \u201cfor his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual\u2019s resistance, revolt, and defeat\u201d.\n\nPaying tribute to his colleague, fellow Peruvian writer Alfredo Bryce Echenique hailed Vargas Llosa\u2019s \u201cenormity\u201d. He told Peruvian radio RPP his friend\u2019s death was \u201ca sorrow for Peru\u201d.\n\nIn a post on X, Peru\u2019s President Dina Boluarte called him the \u201cmost illustrious Peruvian of all time\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis intellectual genius and vast body of work will remain an everlasting legacy for future generations,\u201d she added.\n\nVargas Llosa\u2019s works were also translated into some 30 languages.\n\nUS Deputy State Secretary State Christopher Landau said, \u201cTo label him as just Peruvian would be a disservice because his themes and interests were timeless and universal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will live on in my bookshelves and many others in Latin America and around the world,\u201d Landau wrote on X.\n\nPolitical forays and denouncing Castro\n\nBesides authoring books, Vargas Llosa was also outspoken on political issues.\n\nAlthough an early supporter of the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro, he later grew disillusioned and denounced Castro\u2019s Cuba. By 1980, he said he no longer believed in socialism as a solution for developing nations.\n\nIn 1990, Vargas Llosa ran for president of Peru, saying he wanted to save his country from economic chaos and a Marxist armed rebellion.\n\nHe, however, lost in the run-off to Alberto Fujimori, a then-unknown agronomist and university professor who defeated the armed rebels but was later jailed for human rights crimes and corruption.\n\nFrustrated by his loss, the writer moved to Spain but remained influential in Latin America, harshly criticising a new wave of strident left-wing leaders led by then-Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.\n\n\u201cIn reality, I never had a political career,\u201d Vargas Llosa once said.\n\n\u201cI took part in politics under very special circumstances \u2026 and I always said that whether I won or lost the elections, I was going back to my literary, intellectual job, not politics.\u201d",

    "body": "Cocoa prices surged almost 300 percent last year, making chocolate bars, Easter eggs and cocoa powder much more expensive this year than last.\n\nIn the United States, retail chocolate prices were one-fifth higher this Valentine\u2019s Day compared with last year, according to Wells Fargo Bank. The price of a king-size US-sold Reese\u2019s Hearts chocolate bar was 13 percent higher in February 2024 than in the same month the year before.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, meanwhile, a Twix white chocolate Easter egg rose in price from 5 to 6 pounds ($6.63 to $7.96) at Tesco supermarkets in the run-up to Easter (year-on-year) and was reduced in size from 316g (11oz) to 258g (9oz). In all, the unit price rose by a whopping 47 percent.\n\nWhile the price of cocoa \u2013 the key ingredient in chocolate made from roasted raw cacao beans \u2013 has fallen back by about 20 percent since its all-time high in December 2024, consumers are still paying record prices for chocolate.\n\nThe spike in the price of cocoa can be chalked up to several factors. Chief among them is extreme weather, which has hit cocoa producers in West Africa, from where most of the world imports cocoa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Amber Sawyer, an analyst at the environmental think tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), expensive chocolate should not come as a surprise.\n\n\u201cChocolate is just one of the many foods being made more expensive by climate change-driven extreme weather,\u201d she said. \u201cThese extremes will keep getting worse.\u201d\n\nAnd so might the prices.\n\nWhat has happened to the price of cocoa?\n\nBenchmark New York futures contracts, used to exchange cocoa at a specified future date and price, hit a high of $12,565 per metric tonne in December 2024.\n\nLast year\u2019s meagre cocoa harvest led to record supply shortfalls, as poor weather and disease devastated crops in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, where two-thirds of the world\u2019s cocoa beans are grown.\n\nCrop shortages were also observed in Nigeria and Indonesia, the third- and fourth-largest cocoa producers.\n\nIn all, there was a 500,000-tonne deficit of cocoa in global markets in 2024, which is continuing to keep prices high.\n\nThe latest cocoa harvest \u2013 which ran from October 2024 to March 2025 \u2013 did get off to a bright start, with 33 percent more beans arriving at Ivory Coast ports compared with last year, Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said in a note to clients.\n\nBut while the New York cocoa futures price is currently hovering at about $8,350 per tonne \u2013 a significant drop from December \u2013 concerns are growing that the same dry weather that wrecked last year\u2019s crop will take a similarly devastating toll this year, Fritsch said.\n\nThe uncertainty is taking a toll on chocolate producers. Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut slashed its annual sales forecasts on April 11 due to what it called \u201cunprecedented volatility\u201d in cocoa prices, sending its shares falling almost 20 percent \u2013 its biggest ever one-day drop.\n\nWhat is causing the rise in prices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeather\n\nVolatile weather is one major factor. West Africa experienced extreme rainfall in 2023, with total precipitation more than double the 30-year average in some places, while 2024 saw extreme heat and drought.\n\nMany climate scientists point to the El Nino weather phenomenon, which produces warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, as the primary driver for volatile weather patterns. However, they also expect a transition to the La Nina pattern \u2013 the cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific every three to five years \u2013 to revive cocoa yields at least temporarily.\n\nIndeed, the International Cocoa Organization in February forecast a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 megatonnes for 2024-25, the first surplus in four years. That partly explains the recent fall in price.\n\nBut according to Felipe Pohlmann Gonzaga, a Switzerland-based commodity trader, the larger picture of \u201cclimate change is only going to make supply concerns worse\u201d in the longer term.\n\nScientists at the research group Climate Central published a paper this year showing that climate change compromised cacao trees during the harvest season in Ivory Coast and Ghana.\n\nLaws against deforestation\n\nBesides changing weather patterns, several other issues are also driving recent price hikes in cocoa.\n\nAcross West Africa, new deforestation laws have prevented farmers from expanding cocoa plantations, keeping a lid on supply.\n\nWest Africa is also grappling with an ageing tree stock. \u201cOlder trees are not being replaced,\u201d Pohlmann Gonzaga told Al Jazeera. \u201cThere has been under-investment in the industry.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisease\n\nAt the same time, the spread of the cocoa swollen shoot virus (CSSV) has hit harvests. Tropical Research Services, a market research group, recently found that Ivory Coast cocoa production could halve due to the spread of CSSV.\n\nIllegal gold mining\n\nMeanwhile, Ghanaian cocoa farmers are abandoning beans for gold in an illegal mining boom that has hit Ghana\u2019s cocoa production and helped drive up prices.\n\nIn recent months, investors have been buying up the precious metal to shield themselves from the financial market turmoil unleashed by United States President Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs. On April 16, gold reached $3,357 per ounce for the first time.\n\nAs a result, many farmers are selling their holdings to illegal miners who have decimated swaths of land in pursuit of gold. Ghana is Africa\u2019s leading producer of gold \u2013 and the sixth-largest globally.\n\nWill cocoa prices continue to rise?\n\n\u201cTariffs have had an impact on the value of commodities, and cocoa is no exception,\u201d says Pohlmann Gonzaga. \u201cAt first, you\u2019d think trade levies would reduce demand for cocoa in the US, which is a big consumer.\u201d The US consumes the most chocolate in the world, though the Swiss take that tag for the most per-capita consumption.\n\n\u201cBut if US consumption persists, that could raise prices. And of course, Trump may drop tariffs [on West African cocoa exporters] in the future, which would probably lead to higher demand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPohlmann Gonzaga cited the growing demand for chocolate in East Asia. \u201cWe may be seeing a similar trend as with coffee,\u201d he said. China\u2019s coffee consumption, for instance, increased by more than 60 percent between 2019 and 2024.\n\nIn the near term, Pohlmann Gonzaga said prices are likely to \u201ctrend sideways \u2026 as these factors can cancel each other out. Volatility will be the word of order for this year\u201d.\n\nHow have chocolate manufacturers responded?\n\nSo far, producers have responded in one of two ways \u2013 by passing the higher cost to consumers, or by promoting products with less cocoa or with substitute ingredients.\n\nLast year, food giant Nestle introduced a hazelnut flavour to its British Aero line of chocolate bars, which, at 36g (1.3oz), are about one-third the weight of competing chocolate bars.\n\nIn 2024, agri-food giant Cargill partnered with US chocolate alternatives producer Voyage Foods \u2013 which creates cocoa-free bars from grape seeds, sunflower flour and other flavourings \u2013 to be its business-to-business distributor.\n\nIn addition to big companies, startups like Nukoko and Planet A are exploring microbial fermentation techniques to enhance and mimic the aromas and flavours of chocolate.\n\nElsewhere, Dubai chocolate was founded in 2022. Its products are filled with pistachio and tahini and are inspired by kunafa, the chessy, saccharine dessert that is a staple across the Middle East and North Africa. Since coming to market, it has become a social media sensation.\n\nIf cocoa prices continue rising, \u201cI\u2019d expect to see more and more cocoa substitutes on supermarket shelves. The interesting question is whether consumer tastes will change\u201d, said Pohlmann Gonzaga.",

    "body": "Europe has the industrial and financial might to help Ukraine without the US, says distinguished historian, Phillips O\u2019Brien.\n\nUkraine is at the most difficult point in its existential war since the full-scale Russian invasion began in February, 2022.\n\nThe United States has backed out of the alliance supporting Kyiv, reneging on a multiyear strategic agreement it signed with Ukraine last year.\n\nUkraine has been in a defensive posture for a year, and Russian attacks on Ukrainian soil are increasing.\n\nNow, the US is forcing Ukraine to negotiate for peace from a position of weakness, while demanding payback for $135.7bn in military and financial aid.\n\nWorse could yet come, warns Phillips O\u2019Brien, head of the School of International Relations at St Andrews University and a leading analyst and commentator on Ukraine. The US could drop its sanctions against Russia and back out of NATO.\n\nAl Jazeera spoke with him about why, despite these gloomy prospects, he believes Europe still has the capacity to keep Ukraine fighting, and could ultimately do much more to determine the outcome of this war \u2013 for the sake of its own security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAl Jazeera: Can Europe, plus a few other nations like Japan and Australia, save Ukraine from a bad deal with US President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin?\n\nPhillips O\u2019Brien: They can certainly keep Ukraine in the fight. A lot of it depends on what the US does. We have to be careful about that. If the US actually moves to fully backing Russia and provides Russia with a significant amount of intelligence and support, that will be really a problem for Ukraine and Europe.\n\nBut assuming, say, the US just pulls out and washes its hands of it, Europe has the resources to keep Ukraine going. It would require mobilisation, effort, a significant amount of commitment on Europe\u2019s part. So far, they\u2019ve not, I think, shown the united will to do that, but they certainly could do it if they wanted to. They have the money. They have the technological know-how. They even have the military equipment to make a significant difference.\n\nAl Jazeera: So you believe that \u2013 intelligence aside \u2013 Europe and Ukraine can quite quickly develop the defence industrial base needed?\n\nO\u2019Brien: Ukraine\u2019s already developing a lot of it, so what [Europeans] could do is help supercharge what the Ukrainians are doing in, say, UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] production. The Russian military is not this unstoppable machine. I think we have to realise it is still a deeply flawed institution.\n\nIt\u2019s been protected by the US in many ways throughout this war in the way that the US has aided Ukraine not to attack the Russian military machine in Russia, and that\u2019s been a conscious choice of the US. Europe could actually change, if it wanted to, the way it helped Ukraine to free up Ukraine, to provide it more aid to attack Russian production or Russian military facilities in Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he aims to make 30,000 long-range drones this year and 3,000 cruise missiles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat would be very impressive if they could get that money up and running, and that would, I think, put Russian logistics and military production under significant pressure.\n\nAl Jazeera: What would be the potential consequences of crossing the United States and Russia if Ukraine and Europe really banded together and did all these things, given what you said before about the US not necessarily remaining a neutral party?\n\nO\u2019Brien: If these tariffs [Trump announced on April 2] come into effect, it\u2019s already going to be an economic war with Europe. One of the things it could fully do \u2013 I think in many ways it\u2019s already done it de facto \u2013 is to say, \u2018The US will have no role defending Europe under NATO Article 5\u2019.\n\nThey could basically cut Europe off of the transatlantic alliance. I think the most dangerous thing for Europe in the immediate term is to end the nuclear guarantees, basically saying to Russia, \u2018We\u2019re not protecting Europe,\u2019 which means Europe\u2019s nuclear guarantee goes completely down to a very small number of French and British submarines.\n\nAl Jazeera: But Putin has already made nuclear threats. He did it when he dropped the Oreshnik ballistic missile on Dnipro last November \u2026\n\nO\u2019Brien: I don\u2019t think anyone in Europe took [previous threats] seriously as a threat against Europe because of the US nuclear shield.\n\nAl Jazeera: Is there a European deficit in intelligence capabilities?\n\nO\u2019Brien: Basically, much of European intelligence has been integrated with the US, and they had been provided a lot of information from the US, and the US has technological capabilities that they don\u2019t have.\n\nSo right away, you\u2019d have to rely on less good, less developed systems.\n\n[Starlink] is just part of it. [There\u2019s] US eyes in the sky, US listening, US intelligence sharing \u2013 they do have the kind of surveillance that Europe does not have at this point. It will leave you far worse off immediately, and Europe will have to build up a new system in its place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAl Jazeera: Would you, in this scenario of confrontation, expect pushback from within the United States or US forces in Europe?\n\nO\u2019Brien: Congress could try and force back at any time. The issue is the president\u2019s commander-in-chief, and right now, the Republicans have no desire to stand up to him.\n\nAl Jazeera: Why is it important for Europe to make that stand?\n\nO\u2019Brien: Because with the US out of the game, Ukraine becomes incredibly important to the future of European security.\n\nIf you take the US out, the state of Ukraine is absolutely, without a doubt, central to European security, because Ukraine is the difference, as Putin understands, between Russia being a threat to the continent or not.\n\nIf they can take Ukraine and rebuild in possession of Ukraine\u2019s resources, one assumes subsuming Belarus as well, then they\u2019re in a much better position. Who knows what happens with the populists in France or with the populists in other European countries.

    "clean_body": "europe has the industrial and financial might to help ukraine without the us says distinguished historian phillips o\u2019brien ukraine is at the most difficult point in its existential war since the fullscale russian invasion began in february 2022 the united states has backed out of the alliance supporting kyiv reneging on a multiyear strategic agreement it signed with ukraine last year ukraine has been in a defensive posture for a year and russian attacks on ukrainian soil are increasing now the us is forcing ukraine to negotiate for peace from a position of weakness while demanding payback for 1357bn in military and financial aid worse could yet come warns phillips o\u2019brien head of the school of international relations at st andrews university and a leading analyst and commentator on ukraine the us could drop its sanctions against russia and back out of nato al jazeera spoke with him about why despite these gloomy prospects he believes europe still has the capacity to keep ukraine fighting and could ultimately do much more to determine the outcome of this war \u2013 for the sake of its own security advertisement al jazeera can europe plus a few other nations like japan and australia save ukraine from a bad deal with us president trump and russian leader vladimir putin phillips o\u2019brien they can certainly keep ukraine in the fight a lot of it depends on what the us does we have to be careful about that if the us actually moves to fully backing russia and provides russia with a significant amount of intelligence and support that will be really a problem for ukraine and europe but assuming say the us just pulls out and washes its hands of it europe has the resources to keep ukraine going it would require mobilisation effort a significant amount of commitment on europe\u2019s part so far they\u2019ve not i think shown the united will to do that but they certainly could do it if they wanted to they have the money they have the technological knowhow they even have the military equipment to make a significant difference al jazeera so you believe that \u2013 intelligence aside \u2013 europe and ukraine can quite quickly develop the defence industrial base needed o\u2019brien ukraine\u2019s already developing a lot of it so what europeans could do is help supercharge what the ukrainians are doing in say uav unmanned aerial vehicle production the russian military is not this unstoppable machine i think we have to realise it is still a deeply flawed institution it\u2019s been protected by the us in many ways throughout this war in the way that the us has aided ukraine not to attack the russian military machine in russia and that\u2019s been a conscious choice of the us europe could actually change if it wanted to the way it helped ukraine to free up ukraine to provide it more aid to attack russian production or russian military facilities in russia ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy says he aims to make 30000 longrange drones this year and 3000 cruise missiles advertisement that would be very impressive if they could get that money up and running and that would i think put russian logistics and military production under significant pressure al jazeera what would be the potential consequences of crossing the united states and russia if ukraine and europe really banded together and did all these things given what you said before about the us not necessarily remaining a neutral party o\u2019brien if these tariffs trump announced on april 2 come into effect it\u2019s already going to be an economic war with europe one of the things it could fully do \u2013 i think in many ways it\u2019s already done it de facto \u2013 is to say \u2018the us will have no role defending europe under nato article 5\u2019 they could basically cut europe off of the transatlantic alliance i think the most dangerous thing for europe in the immediate term is to end the nuclear guarantees basically saying to russia \u2018we\u2019re not protecting europe\u2019 which means europe\u2019s nuclear guarantee goes completely down to a very small number of french and british submarines al jazeera but putin has already made nuclear threats he did it when he dropped the oreshnik ballistic missile on dnipro last november \u2026 o\u2019brien i don\u2019t think anyone in europe took previous threats seriously as a threat against europe because of the us nuclear shield al jazeera is there a european deficit in intelligence capabilities o\u2019brien basically much of european intelligence has been integrated with the us and they had been provided a lot of information from the us and the us has technological capabilities that they don\u2019t have so right away you\u2019d have to rely on less good less developed systems starlink is just part of it there\u2019s us eyes in the sky us listening us intelligence sharing \u2013 they do have the kind of surveillance that europe does not have at this point it will leave you far worse off immediately and europe will have to build up a new system in its place advertisement al jazeera would you in this scenario of confrontation expect pushback from within the united states or us forces in europe o\u2019brien congress could try and force back at any time the issue is the president\u2019s commanderinchief and right now the republicans have no desire to stand up to him al jazeera why is it important for europe to make that stand o\u2019brien because with the us out of the game ukraine becomes incredibly important to the future of european security if you take the us out the state of ukraine is absolutely without a doubt central to european security because ukraine is the difference as putin understands between russia being a threat to the continent or not if they can take ukraine and rebuild in possession of ukraine\u2019s resources one assumes subsuming belarus as well then they\u2019re in a much better position who knows what happens with the populists in france or with the populists in other european countries it\u2019s a very very dangerous situation europe is torn between those that want action and those who still can\u2019t believe what they\u2019re looking at it\u2019s deeply frustrating because you could see a year ago that a trump presidency was coming down the pike there was a significant chance europe had

    "body": "Authorities are still working to find out what caused one of Europe\u2019s worst blackouts.\n\nSpain and Portugal have regained access to electricity after one of Europe\u2019s worst blackouts paralysed transport systems, disrupted mobile communications and postponed medical procedures.\n\nFor almost a day from Monday to early on Tuesday, tens of millions of people were plunged into darkness. In major cities like Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon, people were trapped in lifts, stuck on trains and unable to access the internet.\n\nMeanwhile, queues snaked outside the few supermarkets running on backup generators as people stocked up on dried goods, water and battery-powered flashlights.\n\nThe Spanish and Portuguese governments quickly convened emergency meetings after the outage, which hit Spain and Portugal about 12:30 (10:30 GMT) on Monday and also briefly affected southern France.\n\nAlmost no one in the Iberian Peninsula, which has a population of almost 60 million people, escaped the blackout. Madrid was forced to declare a state of emergency.\n\nAlthough power has been largely restored, transport remains in dire straits, with trains and flights reporting delays. No firm cause for the shutdown has yet emerged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the power back on, attention is turning to what caused such a widespread failure of the region\u2019s networks.\n\nWhat caused the power outage?\n\nPortugal\u2019s electricity provider, Redes Energeticas Nacionais (REN), said a \u201crare atmospheric phenomenon\u201d had caused a severe imbalance in temperatures that led to the widespread shutdowns.\n\nREN said: \u201cDue to extreme temperature variations in the interior of Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 kV), a phenomenon known as \u2018induced atmospheric vibration\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Portuguese prime minister, Luis Montenegro, also said the issue originated in Spain.\n\nHowever, in a statement on Tuesday, Spain\u2019s national meteorological office, Aemet, appeared to rule out the weather as a culprit.\n\n\u201cDuring the day of 28 April, no unusual meteorological or atmospheric phenomena were detected, and nor were there sudden variations in the temperature in our network of meteorological stations,\u201d Aemet said.\n\nThe Spanish government said the cause of the power cut is still unknown and warned against speculation.\n\n\u201cMy gut feeling is that multiple factors were behind the blackout,\u201d Kang Li, smart energy systems chairman at the University of Leeds, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIt usually takes several months for forensic grid data to be properly analysed,\u201d he added, \u201cthough an interim report could be done in several weeks.\u201d\n\nBloomberg News reported that Spain has seen a record number of hours with negative power prices in recent months as more wind and solar energy supplies the grid. Until now, however, oversupply hadn\u2019t led to blackouts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2024, renewable energy sources accounted for 56 percent of all electricity used in Spain, a record high. By 2030, that proportion is expected to reach 81 percent.\n\nAccording to Li, \u201cit\u2019s harder to manage energy output when infrastructure is changing so quickly. A higher penetration of renewables with existing systems creates more fluctuation in the operating system.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said, \u201cWe have never had a complete collapse of the system,\u201d explaining how Spain\u2019s power grid lost 15 gigawatts, the equivalent of 60 percent of its national demand, in just five seconds.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no evidence yet of a cyberattack, Sanchez said he isn\u2019t ruling anything out. He warned against speculation but said \u201cno cause can be discredited at this point\u201d.\n\nCould a cyberattack have caused the blackout?\n\nAlthough investigations into the cause of the outage are ongoing, Portugal\u2019s National Cybersecurity Centre threw cold water on the idea of foul play, saying there was no sign that the outage resulted from a cyberattack.\n\nPortuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro also said there was \u201cno indication\u201d of a cyberattack.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Brussels, Teresa Ribera, an executive vice president of the European Commission, also ruled out sabotage. Nonetheless, the outage \u201cis one of the most serious episodes recorded in Europe in recent times\u201d, she said.\n\nFor now, the Spanish government said it is waiting for more information on the cause of the blackout. State officials said they hope in the coming days to know what the cause was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich countries were affected?\n\nSpain and Portugal were the worst affected, but outages occurred elsewhere too:\n\nSpain: Urban centres such as Avila, Madrid, Murcia, Galicia, Alicante, Zaragoza, Barcelona and Seville reported widespread disruptions. The Canary and Balearic islands were not affected.\n\nPortugal: Lisbon and Porto experienced comparable challenges.\n\nSouthern France: Parts of the French Basque Country saw brief power outages. But officials from the French electricity transmission network said the interruptions lasted only a few minutes.\n\nMorocco: Some reports suggested internet providers in Morocco struggled briefly to keep their services running because of network connections with France and the outages there.\n\nGreenland: Remote regions of Greenland lost access to key satellite services, including internet and telephones. Authorities said they own satellite equipment in Spain although a direct cause has not yet been established.\n\nHas power been restored?\n\nBy mid-afternoon on Monday, Spain\u2019s electricity operator, Red Electrica (REE), said it had started to recover voltage in the north, south and west of the country.\n\nThe recovery process was carried out gradually to avoid overloading the grid as generators linked up. Power also returned to Portugal bit by bit. By Monday night, REN said 85 of its 89 power substations were back online.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, power had almost fully returned to Spain and Portugal.\n\nAt 6:30am (04:30 GMT) more than 99 percent of energy demand in Spain had been restored, REE said. Elsewhere, power was restored overnight to 6.2 million of Portugal\u2019s 6.5 million households.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the city level, Madrid\u2019s metro system said service was restored on all but one line by 8am (06:00 GMT), meaning that 80 percent of trains were operating during Tuesday morning\u2019s rush hour.\n\nHas Europe suffered from blackouts of this scale before?\n\nWhile outages are not unheard of in Europe, the scale of Iberia\u2019s power failure was one of the largest in recent history.\n\nIn 2019, England and Wales suffered regional blackouts amid lightning strikes at a gas-fired power plant in Bedfordshire and an offshore wind farm off the east coast of England.\n\nA 2006 German power overload caused outages as far away as Portugal and Morocco. In 2003, a problem with a hydroelectric power line between Italy and Switzerland caused an outage across Italy for about 12 hours.\n\n\u201cInterconnection between countries has positive benefits as it can improve efficiency and reduce costs. \u2026 It\u2019s always sunny or raining somewhere in Europe,\u201d Li said.\n\n\u201cBut\u201d, he added \u201cinterconnected systems mean that local faults in one location can have domino effects elsewhere. Transmission lines can become overloaded.\u201d\n\nLi also pointed out that climate change and rising temperatures pose \u201cincreasing risks\u201d for Spain-and-Portugal-style blackouts.\n\n\u201cHeat, excessive rain and wildfires all increase the risk of transmission failures. We can address this by investing more in clean energy generation to increase energy system flexibility.\u201d",

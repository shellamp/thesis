    "title": "Archbishop of Canterbury: Why did Justin Welby resign after abuse scandal?",
    "body": "The abuse scandal that led to the archbishop's resignation\n\n12 November 2024 Share Save Amy Walker BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nJustin Welby has resigned as Archbishop of Canterbury after facing increasing pressure to stand down over his failure to report prolific child abuser John Smyth. Here are the events that led up to Mr Welby's resignation after 11 years in the post.\n\nWhy has Welby resigned?\n\nA damning independent review published last week found Mr Welby - the most senior bishop within the Church of England - and other church officers should have formally reported Smyth in 2013 to police in the UK and authorities in South Africa. Smyth was accused of attacking dozens of boys, including those he met at Christian camps, in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s. The barrister and senior member of a Christian charity then moved to Zimbabwe and later South Africa, where he abused up to 100 boys aged 13 to 17, the Makin review added. By 2013, the Church of England \"knew, at the highest level\" about Smyth's abuse, including Mr Welby who took up the Church's top job that year. If he and other Church officers had reported this to police in the UK and authorities in South Africa at that time, \u201cJohn Smyth could have [been] brought to justice at a much earlier point\u201d, the independent report said. Mr Welby had previously resisted calls to step aside over his response to the case since 2013. But amid mounting pressure, he said in a statement on Tuesday he must take \"personal and institutional responsibility\". The prime minister's spokeswoman said Keir Starmer \"respects the decision\" to step down and his thoughts \"first and foremost, remain with all the victims\u201d.\n\nWhen did the abuse allegations first surface?\n\nSmyth was under police investigation when he died\n\nSmyth's abuse was first reported to the charity Iwerne Trust, where he had been chairman, in the early 1980s. A report detailing his \"horrific\" beatings of teenaged boys was presented to some Church leaders in 1982. But the recipients of that report \"participated in an active cover-up\" to prevent its findings, including that crimes had been committed, coming to light, the Makin review said. Smyth's abuse in the UK re-emerged in 2012, when a church officer in Cambridgeshire received a letter \u201cout of the blue\u201d from a fellow survivor. The review stated that five police forces were told of the abuse between 2013 and 2016. Church leaders however did not lodge a formal report. It was not until 2017, after a Channel 4 documentary revealed details about Smyth's abuse to the public, that police launched a full investigation. Smyth is believed to have continued his abuse in South Africa until his death in 2018.\n\nHow much did Welby know about Smyth?\n\nMr Welby worked at summer camps in Dorset where Smyth met some of his victims, but the archbishop said he was unaware of the nature of the allegations until 2013. A member of the clergy warned Mr Welby about Smyth in the 1980s, but the archbishop told the review this had been \"vague\" and \"there was no indication given of the abuses which later came to light\". After the Channel 4 documentary was broadcast in 2017, Mr Welby apologised \"unreservedly\" to Smyth's victims but did not resign. Following the Makin review this month, the archbishop said he had considered resigning over its findings and repeated his apology. Mr Welby acknowledged that the review made clear he had \"personally failed to ensure it was energetically investigated\". But on Tuesday, following a petition set up by members of the Church's parliament - the General Synod - and mounting pressure to go, Mr Welby resigned.\n\nWhat did his critics say?\n\nDIOCESE OF NEWCASTLE Bishop Hartley said it was \"hard to find the words\" to respond to last week's report\n\nCritics included Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley, who said Mr Welby's resignation would \"be a very clear indication that a line has been drawn, and that we must move towards independence of safeguarding\". Andrew Morse, a survivor of Smyth's abuse, also called for Mr Welby to go, saying that he felt the archbishop's admission that he had not done enough in response to the reports meant that both he and the Church of England had effectively been involved in a \"cover-up\". The petition calling for his resignation, which accused the archbishop of \"allowing abuse to continue\" and said his position was \"no longer tenable\", was signed by more than 14,000 people. The prime minister had also publicly said victims of Smyth had been \"failed very, very badly,\" but would not comment when asked whether the archbishop should quit.\n\nHow will the new Archbishop of Canterbury be chosen?",

Prosecutor Eloise Marshall KC told the court: \"I advised the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) on quite a number of issues and ultimately the decision was made due to a combination of factors.\" She added there were difficulties around \"material provided directly from the complainant himself\". Judge Patricia Lees said: \"In those circumstances then the court will enter not guilty verdicts in respect of each defendant. \"As far as they are concerned they are discharged from the court.\" Ms Fayed, of Park Lane, central London, did not attend the hearing on Wednesday but Mr Esreb, also of Park Lane, Mr Littlewood, of Haydock Road, Colburn, North Yorkshire, and Mr Bott, of Coppice Wood, County Durham, appeared via a video link.

    "title": "UK wants 'strong' relationship with China, says Keir Starmer",
    "body": "We want 'strong' UK-China relationship, says Starmer\n\n18 November 2024 Share Save Sam Francis & Jennifer McKiernan Political reporter Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nSir Keir Starmer has met President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit, and emphasised the importance of a \"strong UK-China relationship\" for both countries. The meeting was the first time a UK prime minister has met the Chinese president in person since 2018, following a recent souring in relations. Sir Keir raised the case of the jailed Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, Jimmy Lai, saying he was concerned about reports of a \"deterioration\" in his health. The PM also signalled a desire for greater business co-operation, particularly on \"areas of mutual cooperation\" such as international stability, climate change and economic growth.\n\nSir Keir met President Xi on the fringes of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and, speaking at the start of the meeting, said: \"We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful, as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible.\" He added: \"The UK will be a predictable, consistent, sovereign actor committed to the rule of law.\" Speaking through a translator, Xi told Sir Keir that the two countries should commit to mutual respect and openness, saying: \"China and the UK have broad space for co-operation across various domains, including trade, investment, clean energy, financial services, healthcare and improving our peoples' well-being.\" A read-out of the closed door meeting said the PM set out the leaders' shared responsibility to work together in pursuit of global stability, economic co-operation and trade, and efforts to move away from fossil fuels to renewables. Climate change was a focus for the PM, and a Downing Street spokesperson said the PM wants China's support on global efforts, particularly in light of President-elect Trump's expected roll back of green policies. However, Sir Keir also stressed his government's approach would \"always be rooted in the national interests of the UK, but that we would be a predictable and pragmatic partner\" to China. With China's military support for Russia's war in Ukraine having prompted criticism from the UK and other Western countries, the PM also said he wanted to \"engage honestly and frankly\" on areas of disagreement, including on Hong Kong, human rights and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Their first meeting follows an initial phone conversation in August after Labour's election victory and Sir Keir has now proposed a full bilateral meeting in Beijing or London. The pair also agreed Chancellor Rachel Reeves should visit Beijing next year to discuss economic and financial cooperation with her counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng. The Conservative's shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said: \u201cBritain's standing on the world stage risks being weakened if the prime minister does not robustly defend our national interest.\" She said constructive dialogue was important but that Sir Keir \"should have been stronger in raising our concerns over human rights, the repressive nature of the national security laws imposed on Hong Kong, and the security, safety and wellbeing of British nationals, like Jimmy Lai, who should be freed from custody\". \"Starmer must set out, as part of his supposed reset, what assurances he received from President Xi on the UK\u2019s areas of concern.\u201d\n\nBefore the meeting in Brazil, the prime minister said it was important to engage with economies like China - and Foreign Secretary David Lammy held talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, as well as Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, in Beijing last month. The last British prime minister to meet President Xi was Theresa May, who hailed a \"golden era\" for UK-China relations during her 2018 visit to the country. But since then there have been tensions over issues including China's treatment of the Uyghur minority group in Xinjiang and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. Last year, then-Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said China was \"the biggest state-based threat to our economic security\". But like the current government, he also said it was necessary to engage with China on issues like climate change and the global economy. Dr Yu Jie, a China expert from the Chatham House international think tank, said the G20 meeting was \"critical\" for UK-China relations to thaw after a six-year freeze - and suggested there could be a trade deal in sight, despite significant diplomatic tensions. \"Judging from the readout given by both sides, the tone of the conversation seemed to be positive,\" said Dr Yu. \"But when they came to specifics it seems on the thorny issues they have not really reached any agreement at all.\" Dr Yu warned both sides' efforts could still be overshadowed by pressure from the US. \"That's something quite difficult for the British government, if the US is going to be adding extra pressure for the UK to be in line with the US on China policy,\" she said, describing how she expected the US policy towards China to be \"hawkish\" under Trump.\n\nReuters Jimmy Lai - a pro-democracy activist and British citizen - was arrested in 2020 and his release from a Hong Kong prison is a \"priority\", the UK government says\n\nSpeaking to reporters on his way to the summit in Rio de Janeiro, Sir Keir also said \"shoring up support for Ukraine\" was top of his agenda. Before the meeting, Downing Street said the prime minister will urge other G20 nations to step up their support for Ukraine or face \"unfathomable consequences\" if Russia is allowed to be victorious. The summit follows large-scale missile and drone attacks by Russia across Ukraine over the weekend, and will take place as the conflict approaches its 1,000th day. And it comes amid reports that the US has authorised the use of long-range missiles it supplies to Ukraine to strike Russia. The weapons have so far only been used by Kyiv on Russian-occupied targets within its own territory. The UK has also supplied Ukraine with its Storm Shadow missiles and defence officials and ministers have been making the case for Kyiv to be permitted to use them to hit targets inside Russia. But they were not willing to act alone - and had been waiting for the White House to change its mind. Sir Keir said he was \"not going to get into operational details\" with regards to missiles in Ukraine.\n\nSir Keir is holding talks with other G20 leaders, representing 19 of the world\u2019s largest economies and the African Union and the European Union. The summit is overshadowed by the absence of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has called for allies to take a more aggressive approach towards China and may trigger a global trade war if he imposes a promised 60% tariff on Chinese goods entering the US. This summit will provide world leaders a first chance to compare notes and prepare for Trump's upcoming return to the White House.",

    "body": "China is trying to fix its economy - Trump could derail those plans\n\n8 November 2024 Share Save Jo\u00e3o da Silva Business reporter Share Save\n\nReuters Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at their last face-to-face meeting in 2019\n\nChina has unveiled new measures aimed at boosting its flagging economy, as it braces for a second Donald Trump presidency. The country plans to tackle tens of billions of dollars of local government debt to prevent it being a drag on growth. Trump won the US election on a platform that promised steep import taxes, including tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods. His victory is now likely to hinder Xi Jinping\u2019s plans to transform the country into a technology powerhouse \u2013 and further strain relations between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. A property slump, rising government debt and unemployment, and low consumption have slowed down Chinese growth since the pandemic.\n\nSo the stakes are higher than ever for the latest announcement from the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), the executive body of China's legislature. During his first term in office Trump hit Chinese goods with tariffs of as much as 25%. China analyst Bill Bishop says Trump should be taken at his word about his new tariff plans. \"I think we should believe that he means it when [he] talks about tariffs, that he sees China as having reneged on his trade deal, that he thinks China and Covid cost him the 2020 election\". The pressure from Washington did not ease after Trump left the White House in 2021. The Biden administration kept the measures in place and in some cases widened them. While the first wave of Trump tariffs were painful for China, the country is now in a much more vulnerable position. The economy has been struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels of growth since abruptly abandoning its tight Covid restrictions two years ago. Instead of delivering a widely expected fast-paced recovery, China became a regular source of disappointing economic news. Even before Trump's election victory and after China began rolling out measures to support its economy in September, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered its annual growth target for the country. The IMF now expects the Chinese economy to expand by 4.8% in 2024, at the lower end of Beijing's \"about 5%\" target. Next year, it projects China's annual growth rate will drop further to 4.5%. The latest plan involves using an additional 6 trillion yuan ($840bn) from now until 2026 to bail out local governments which have piled up unsustainable levels of debt. For decades, local governments have helped drive growth throughout the country by borrowing massive sums of money - much of which paid for infrastructure projects. But a downturn in the property industry has left some cities unable to pay their bills.\n\nBut the country's leaders were not caught entirely off guard by the end to decades of super-fast growth. Speaking in 2017, President Xi said his country planned to transition from \"rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development.\" The term has since been used repeatedly by Chinese officials to describe a shift to an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and green industries. But some economists say China cannot simply export itself out of trouble. China risks falling into the type of decades-long stagnation that Japan endured after a stock and property bubble burst in the 1990s, Morgan Stanley Asia's former chairman, Stephen Roach, says. To avoid that fate, he says China should draw \"on untapped consumer demand\" and move away from \"export and investment-led growth\". That would not only encourage more sustainable growth but also lower \"trade tensions and [China's] vulnerability to external shocks,\" he says. This more robust economic model could help China fend off the kind of threats posed by Trump's return to power.\n\nNew economy, old problems",

The rap megastar is famously a fan of Toronto Raptors - the NBA's only Canadian team - and is regularly seen courtside watching games. He's also said to have made friends with current and former players, including DeMar DeRozan, who returned to the Raptors' Scotiabank Arena as a member of opponents Sacramento Kings on Saturday. But the Hotline Bling star didn't exactly welcome his old friend back with open arms.\n\nGetty Images Drake caught up with ex-Raptors player Vince Carter before his number 15 jersey was retired\n\nDuring the weekend's match-up the Raptors retired the jersey of legend Vince Carter. It's a common tribute NBA teams perform to honour significant former players, hanging their numbers from banners high up inside stadiums. DeRozan is a six-time NBA All-Star who played for the Raptors from 2009 to 2018, making him a good candidate for the same treatment. But speaking on Canadian Sports network TSN, Drake said: \"If you ever put a DeRozan banner up, I'll go up there and pull it down myself.\" Speaking to reporters after the game, he clapped back at the rapper when asked about his comments. \"He's going to have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck,\" he said.\n\nDeRozan appeared in the video for Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us - the fiery diss track aimed at Drake that blew up the internet when it dropped earlier this year. The basketball star also appeared on stage with Lamar when he performed the track in Los Angeles over the summer. DeRozan told reporters at the time that he still considered Drake a friend, and compared the feud to a spectacle along the lines of Michael Jordan facing Kobe Bryant one-on-one. Based on Drake's brief comment, the rapper might not feel quite the same. But he can at least take comfort in the fact that the Raptors beat the Kings by 131-128.",

But president Xi also took the opportunity to state China\u2019s objectives in what appears to be a message to Donald Trump and the next administration in Washington. In a robust readout of the meeting released afterwards, Beijing said President Xi had underscored that \"a new Cold War should not be fought and cannot be won. Containing China is unwise, unacceptable and bound to fail\". Xi also said a stable relationship between China and the United States was \"critical to both parties and the world\".\n\nThe two met on Saturday on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Peru where they acknowledged \"ups and downs\" in relations over Biden's four years in office. Speaking at Saturday's meeting, which was held at President Xi's hotel in Lima, the leader said that if the US and China \"treat each other as opponents or enemies, engage in vicious competition and mutual harm, China-US relations will suffer setbacks or even regressions\". He added that Beijing's goal of a stable relationship with Washington would remain unchanged and that he would work with the new US administration \"to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences.\" Biden, meanwhile, said strategic competition between the two global powers should not escalate into war. \"Our two countries cannot let any of this competition veer into conflict. That is our responsibility and over the last four years I think we've proven it's possible to have this relationship,\" he said. Both leaders highlighted progress in lowering tensions on issues such as trade and Taiwan. Analysts say US-China relations could become more volatile when Trump returns to office in two months, driven by factors including a promise to raise tariffs on Chinese imports. The president-elect has pledged 60% tariffs on all imports from China. He has also appointed prominent China hawks to top foreign and defence positions. During his first term, Trump labelled Beijing a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d. Relations worsened when he labelled Covid a \u201cChinese virus\u201d during the pandemic.",

The force said it had made a mandatory referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct because there was previous contact with Ms Brella. Northamptonshire Telegraph first reported she was the subject of a domestic violence protection order, saying it was made in early September and lasted 28 days.

    "body": "Israel hit part of Iran's nuclear programme, Netanyahu says\n\nAxios reported last week that a \u201cnuclear weapons research facility\u201c at Parchin was hit in late October\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Iran, but it has previously said the Israeli strikes caused limited damage to radar systems and that its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful.\n\nHe gave no details, but last week Axios reported that a \u201cnuclear weapons research facility\u201d making plastic explosives at the Parchin military complex was destroyed .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a secret. It was published,\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu told the Israeli parliament. \u201cThere is a specific component in their nuclear programme that was hit.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s prime minister says it hit part of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme last month, despite pleas from the US not to do so during the strikes it carried out in response to a missile attack.\n\nIran has also insisted that it does not seek nuclear weapons, although evidence collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) suggests that until 2003 it conducted activities relevant to the development of a bomb. The agency says Iran has not yet answered outstanding questions related to its nuclear activity.\n\nThe IAEA also says Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium to build several nuclear weapons since the US abandoned a nuclear deal and reinstated crippling sanctions six years ago with Netanyahu\u2019s support.\n\nOn 26 October, the Israeli military announced it had conducted \u201cprecise strikes on military targets in Iran\u201d in response to the 1 October attack that saw almost 200 ballistic missiles launched towards Israel.\n\nThe military said the targets included missile manufacturing facilities, as well as surface-to-air missile arrays and aerial capabilities intended to restrict Israel\u2019s freedom of operation inside Iran.\n\nIran\u2019s military said the attacks caused \u201climited and minor damage\u201d to several radar systems and that four Iranian military officers and one civilian were killed.

    "body": "Russia vows 'tangible' response if US missiles used against its territory\n\n19 November 2024 Share Save Paulin Kola BBC News Share Save\n\nREX/Shutterstock The Russian foreign ministry issued a statement on Monday\n\nRussia says the use of US long-range missiles by Ukraine will lead to \"an appropriate and tangible\" response. Such an attack inside Russian territory \"would represent the direct involvement of the United States and its satellites in hostilities against Russia\", a foreign ministry statement said. President Joe Biden approved the use of the missiles on targets in Russia in a major change of US policy - two months before he is due to leave the White House. It is not clear if his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, was consulted or whether he will stick by the decision, having promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nUkraine has had US ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) with a range of 300km (190 miles) - as well as French and British Storm Shadow missiles of a similar range - but the Western allies had barred Kyiv from hitting Russia with them. Biden's decision to lift that condition is a significant moment in the war, which marks its 1,000th day on Tuesday. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Moscow has now intensified attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure as the sides appear to have reached a stalemate on the battlefield. Could missiles change the course of the war?\n\nRosenberg: Fury in Russia\n\nWhat we know about North Korean soldiers in Russia\n\nUkraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia The US decision also follows the arrival in Russia's western Kursk region - where Ukrainian forces captured and are holding onto a small piece of territory - of more than 10,000 troops from North Korea to help President Vladimir Putin's forces. Unconfirmed reports say North Korea may send as many as 100,000 soldiers, in addition to artillery and other weapons to its ally.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has indicated there may be no formal announcement of the US deal - \"the missiles will speak for themselves,\" he said on Sunday. Ukraine may use the ATACMS in Kursk first - in fact some reports suggest the US may have restricted their use there as a signal to North Korea to stop sending aid to Russia and to Moscow itself. Biden's approval of the long-range missiles - which may be followed by similar authorisations by the UK and France - is being seen in the West as a way of signalling to the Russian leader that he cannot win the Ukraine war militarily. Putin has not commented on the latest move. In September, the Russian leader said the use of such missiles by Ukraine would represent the \"direct participation\" of Nato countries in the war. On Monday, Putin's spokesman said the US was \"adding oil to the fire\". But Jon Finer, US deputy national security adviser, said Washington had made it \"clear to the Russians that we would respond\" - both to the presence of North Korean forces and the \"major escalation\" in Russian aerial attacks on infrastructure across Ukraine. The weekend saw intense Russian attacks against Ukraine's power grid, causing large-scale blackouts. Several people were killed or injured. On Monday, a Russian strike on Odesa killed another 10 people and injured nearly 50.",

The blaze broke out in one of the wooden stands at the club's Valley Parade ground on 11 May 1985 during a match between Bradford and Lincoln. The new film, with a working title of Unforgotten: The Bradford City Fire, would feature the personal testimonies of those who were there, many of whom would be speaking for the first time, according to the BBC. Jaimie D\u2019Cruz, executive producer, said because the tragedy was in danger of fading from memory, it was a \"privilege and a responsibility\" to make the documentary.\n\nIt is believed the fire, which caused the deaths of 54 Bradford fans and two Lincoln fans, and which left more than 260 people injured, was caused by a discarded cigarette. The stand where the fire broke out had been officially condemned and was due to be demolished and replaced with a steel structure.\n\n'Collective memory'\n\nThe creators of the documentary said it would combine \"extraordinary access\" to the people who survived, as well as family members of the bereaved and members of the emergency crews who attended the scene. The aim of the film was to celebrate \"community, resilience and collective memory\" and the strength of the human spirit in the wake of such devastation, they said. Simon Young, BBC Head of Commissioning, History, said: \u201cThis film gets at the heart of a modern dilemma: in a world where everything is recorded on film, how do we sensitively remember and commemorate?\" \"What should remain off limits? And how do we ensure that a tragedy is marked and the lessons learned for future generations?\" he asked. Mr Young said it was an \"honour\" to be working on the project with the people of Bradford \"to ensure this anniversary is not forgotten\".\n\nFloral tributes were left after the disaster that left 56 dead on 11 May 1985",

    "body": "Authorities say US man faked kayaking death and fled to Europe\n\nOfficials found evidence that Mr Borgwardt had used his passport after his disappearance and may have travelled to Europe.\n\nRyan Borgwardt, 45, a married father of three, was last seen on 12 August at Green Lake while on a solo fishing trip.\n\n\u201cWe believe that he is alive. We know that he's not in our lake,\u201d Matthew Vande Kolk, Chief Deputy Sheriff for Green Lake County, told the BBC.\n\nAuthorities in Green Lake, Wisconsin, say that a local man who went missing while kayaking this summer may have staged his own death and fled to Europe.\n\nMr Borgwardt had last texted his wife on the night of 11 August. The message said he was turning his kayak around and heading to shore soon.\n\nBut when he failed to return home, his family contacted law enforcement who sent out a search-and-rescue team, which found his capsized kayak and life jacket on the lake.\n\nMr Borgwardt\u2019s car, trailer, fishing rod and wallet were all left at the park nearby.\n\nAfter 54 days of extensive search efforts of divers, drones, sonar and cadaver dogs, no body was recovered and no evidence turned up.\n\nThat caused the sheriff's office to widen its scope.\n\nThe case took a turn in October when investigators discovered Mr Borgwardt's name had been checked by border officials in Canada on 13 August, the day after he was reported missing.\n\nInvestigators then learned that Mr Borgwardt had reported his passport lost or stolen and was issued a new one prior to his disappearance.\n\nHis previous passport was later recovered from his wife, indicating he may have travelled on the new document.\n\nFollowing this lead, officials conducted a digital forensic analysis of Mr Borgwardt\u2019s laptop, and they found that he had taken out a $375,000 life insurance policy, had transferred funds to a foreign bank account, photographed his new passport, and altered his email address before he vanished.\n\nAnd after doing this, they discovered that Mr Borgwardt had replaced the laptop\u2019s hard drive and cleared his browser history the day he disappeared.\n\nAuthorities also found indications that he may have traveled to a location in Europe.\n\nWhile the investigation continues, the sheriff\u2019s office told the BBC they are evaluating the appropriate criminal charges that could include obstruction and fraudulent activity.\n\nBorgwardt\u2019s family is cooperating and the chief deputy sheriff said his wife has been \u201cextremely strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has done everything that we have asked of her in regards to helping us with information, and holding on to information,\" Mr Vande Kolk told the BBC. \"Unfortunately, we had to keep this quiet for about a month from the time that we started thinking that he was somewhere else, until we had enough information that we could share with the world, and she did that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur hope is then, at some point we'll be able to hold Ryan accountable for his actions and request restitution,\u201d he added.\n\nAuthorities said that they are continuing to look for Mr. Borgwardt, who they believe is alive and in Eastern Europe, and anyone who may have assisted him in faking his death and fleeing.",

Vaibhav Suryavanshi from the eastern state of Bihar was bought by Rajasthan Royals (RR) for 11m rupees ($130,500; \u00a3103,789) in the recently-concluded auctions in Saudi Arabia. The left-handed batter has represented his state in national championships, such as Ranji and Mushtaq Ali trophies, and India in the Under-19 internationals. Delhi Capitals and RR bid for him starting from 3m rupees but RR, where he had trained previously, managed to seal the deal.\n\nIndian cricket was traditionally dominated by urban centres such as Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru but IPL has managed to attract a wider pool of cricketers from far-off villages and small towns of India. Suryavanshi, who is in Dubai to play India Under-19 Asia Cup, made his Ranji debut at the age of 12 in January with Bihar against Mumbai. In his five Ranji matches, he has scored a highest of 41. But the highlight of his career has been his 58-ball century as an opener in an Under-19 unofficial Test against Australia a few weeks ago \u2013 which also made him the youngest to score a century in youth cricket. He has also made an unbeaten 332 in an Under-19 tournament in Bihar. RR saw raw potential in the youngster as he impressed their coaching staff during a training session. \"He's an incredible talent and, of course, you got to have the confidence so he can step up to the IPL level,\" the team's CEO Jake Lush McCrum told ESPN Cricinfo after the auction ended. He said that Suryavanshi\u2019s development would require work, but \"he is a hell of a talent and we're really excited to have him as part of the franchise\".\n\nVaibhav Suryavanshi/Instagram Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his Ranji debut with Bihar at the age of 12 earlier this year against heavyweight Mumbai",

    "title": "China watching North Korea's friendship with Russia",
    "body": "Kim Jong Un is China's ally - but has become the 'comrade from hell'\n\n1 November 2024 Share Save Laura Bicker BBC News Reporting from Fangchuan, China-Russia-North Korea border Share Save\n\nBBC A tall building on the edge of Fangchuan has become a tourist attraction for the view it offers of North Korea\n\nChinese tourists huddle together against the brisk autumn breeze on a 12-storey building, vying for the best spot to photograph the point where their country meets Russia and North Korea. The three national flags overlap on a map on the wall, which explains that Fangchuan in China\u2019s north-east corner is a unique place for that reason. \u201cI feel very proud to be standing here\u2026 with Russia on my left and North Korea on my right,\u201d declares one woman on a trip with her co-workers. \u201cThere are no borders among the people.\u201d That might be overly optimistic. Like the sliver of sandwiched Chinese territory she has travelled to see, Beijing too is caught between its sanctioned neighbours. Fears over the budding alliance between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un have peaked in recent weeks, with reports of North Korea deploying thousands of troops to support Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. And that was before Pyongyang fired a banned intercontinental missile on Thursday, on the longest flight recorded yet \u2013 after turning up the rhetoric against Seoul for weeks. \u201cChina seeks a relationship with a reasonable, high level of control over North Korea,\u201d says Christopher Green, an analyst from the International Crisis Group. \u201cAnd North Korea\u2019s relationship with Russia threatens to undermine that.\u201d If Chinese leader Xi Jinping is unable shape the Putin-Kim alliance to suit his interests, China may well remain stuck in the middle as western anger and anxiety grows.\n\nMoscow and Pyongyang deny that North Korean soldiers are headed for Ukraine, widely seen as a significant escalation. But the United States says it has seen evidence of this, following allegations by South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence. The first reports emerged just before Xi met his Russian counterpart at the Brics summit earlier in October, overshadowing a gathering that was meant to send the West a defiant message. It increasingly appears as though China\u2019s allies are spiralling out of its control. Beijing, the senior partner in the triad, seeks to be the stable leader of a new world order, one that is not led by the US. But that\u2019s difficult to do when one ally has started a war in Europe, and another is accused of aiding the invasion. \u201cChina is unhappy with the way things are going,\u201d Mr Green says, \u201cbut they are trying to keep their discontent relatively quiet.\u201d It\u2019s certainly a sensitive topic for Beijing, judging by the response to our presence in the border town, where it seems tourists are welcome - but journalists are not. We were in public areas at all times, and yet the team was stopped, repeatedly questioned, followed and our footage deleted. The hotel demanded to keep my passport for \u201cmy safety and the safety of others\u201d. Police visited our hotel rooms, and they also blocked the road to the port at Hunchun, which would have given us a closer view of the current trade between Russia and China.\n\n'Lips and teeth'\n\nOn the viewing platform in Fangchuan, it\u2019s clear that most tourists have come to see North Korea. \u201cI saw a person cycling,\u201d says one girl peering through a telescope. Her friend rushes over to see: \u201cOoooh! It\u2019s such a mysterious country.\u201d Close by is the Tumen river that gently cuts through all three countries. It is China\u2019s gateway into the Sea of Japan, where it has territorial disputes with Tokyo. The 1,400km-long (870 mile) Chinese border has some of the only platforms with a clear view into North Korea. South Korea\u2019s frontier with the North is an almost impenetrable barrier, the heavily mined and fortified Demilitarized Zone. Someone offers me a pair of binoculars. Some people are cycling through the village on ageing bicycles, but there are few other signs of life. One of the largest buildings is a school with a sign calling for children to \u201clearn well for Chosun\u201d, another name for North Korea. \u201cNorth Korea has always been our neighbour. It\u2019s no stranger to us,\u201d says a middle-aged man. \u201cTo be able to see how they live makes me realise China is prosperous and strong.\u201d\n\nChina offers some of the only glimpses into isolated North Korea\n\nChinese tourists are eager to know more about their reclusive neighbour\n\nKim Jong Un\u2019s regime would certainly struggle to survive without its biggest benefactor, China, which accounts for more than 90% of foreign trade, including food and fuel. That was not always the case. In the early 1960s it was the Chinese who fled famine across the Tumen river. Some even went to school in North Korea because they believed its education system at the time was better. The North Korean economy crashed after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 \u2013 which had been its main source of aid and cheap oil - sparking severe food shortages and, eventually, famine. Soon, North Korean refugees began wading through an often freezing river at the risk of being shot dead to escape hunger, poverty and repression. There are now more than 30,000 of them in South Korea and an unknown number still live in China. \u201cSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea hasn\u2019t really had any choice but to maintain good relations with China, which has been its sole benefactor,\u201d Mr Green says. But now, he adds, Russia \u201cis offering an alternative and the North Koreans are seeking to exploit that\u201d. Mao Zedong, the first leader of the People\u2019s Republic of China, had likened the relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang to the closeness between \u201clips and teeth\u201d: \u201cIf the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold.\u201d\n\nThe three-way alliance has long worried the West - and the recent closeness between Moscow and Pyongyang has only aggravated fears\n\n\u2018The comrade from hell\u2019\n\nNow, Beijing finds itself smarting from a lack of gratitude as Kim\u2019s lips are \u201ckissing elsewhere\u201d, according to sociologist Aidan Foster-Carter, who has studied North Korea for several decades. \u201cNorth Korea has consistently been the comrade from hell to both Russia and China. They take as much money as they can and [then] do what they like.\u201d Analysts have noted that Kim has consistently flattered Putin over Xi in the last year. While Kim hasn\u2019t met Xi since 2019, he has met Putin twice in the past year or so. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has drawn the two sanctioned leaders closer than ever. Putin seeks more support for his war and Kim wants to bolster his regime with alliances and attention. From the Chinese border, it\u2019s easy to see the burgeoning relationship between the two sides. The whistle of a train interrupts the tourist chatter, and a steam engine pulling a long line of freight carriages slowly chugs across the railway bridge from Russia to North Korea. It stops in front of a Korean sign facing China which reads: \u201cTowards a new victory!\u201d\n\nThe so-called friendship bridge connecting Russia and North Korea has become a crucial trade route\n\nThe US estimates that Kim has sold more than a million artillery shells and Grad rockets to Moscow for use in Ukraine, which North Korea denies. But there is no doubt that the pair have stepped up cooperation after signing a security pact in June to help each other in the event of \"aggression\" against either country. \u201cYou have very stiff and formal language to Xi Jinping on the occasion of what is actually an historically important event \u2013 the 75th anniversary of relations of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d Mr Foster-Carter says. \u201cAnd yet on Putin\u2019s birthday, Kim calls him \u2018my closest comrade\u2019. If you are Xi Jinping, what are you thinking?\u201d\n\n'Through gritted teeth'\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know, because China has shown no signs of interfering with the Russia-North Korea alliance. The US has noticed Beijing\u2019s disquiet and for once the two rivals may have similar goals. In the last week, State Department officials have raised the issue of North Korean troops in Russia with Chinese diplomats. Beijing does have options - in the past, they have cut supplies of oil and coal to North Korea, and complied with US-led sanctions to curb Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme. Already, China is battling US accusations that it is selling components to Russia that aid its invasion of Ukraine. Beijing\u2019s trade with Moscow is also flourishing, even as it tries to cope with Western tariffs. Xi has kept Russia close because he needs Putin\u2019s help to challenge the US-led world order. But he has not stopped trying to repair ties with Europe, the UK and even the US. China has also been holding talks with Japan and South Korea to ease historic tensions. But Kim\u2019s increasingly aggressive rhetoric against Seoul has the South once again debating whether it should have its own nuclear arsenal. North Korean troops on a Ukrainian battlefield would only further unravel Beijing\u2019s plans. The possibility has already seen South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol discuss \"concrete counter-measures\" and talk of strengthening security cooperation with Ukraine and Nato.\n\nGetty Images What China doesn't want: More instability in East Asia because of a Putin-Kim alliance\n\nA nuclear-armed South Korea or an \u201cEast Asian Nato\u201d are not ideal in a region where China wants greater sway. An emboldened Kim could also draw a stronger show of support from the US \u2013 in the form of warships or even weapons - towards its allies, Seoul and Tokyo. \u201cFor a very long time, China has had a policy of three nos in Northeast Asia \u2013 one of those nos was a no nuclear North Korea. Obviously that has been a failure,\u201d Mr Green says. Now Beijing fears that the alliance with Russia could destabilise North Korea, he adds: \u201cThat could even benefit Vladimir Putin in a way it really would not benefit Xi Jinping.\u201d Experts say Beijing is just as worried as the West about what military technology Putin might sell to Kim in exchange for troops. \u201cSatellites, for sure,\u201d Mr Foster-Carter says. \u201cBut Putin is bad \u2013 not mad. Russia knows just as China knows that North Korea is a loose cannon. Giving [Kim] more technology for nukes is not a good thing for anybody.\u201d Experts believe Xi is unlikely to do anything drastic because China needs a stable North Korea \u2013 if he cuts off aid, he would likely have a refugee crisis at the border.\n\nAFP Another meeting on the cards?

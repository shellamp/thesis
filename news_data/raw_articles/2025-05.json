    "body": "AfD classified as extreme-right by German intelligence\n\n2 May 2025 Share Save Paul Kirby Europe digital editor Share Save\n\nReuters Alice Weidel, joint AfD leader, said the decision was a \"severe blow against German democracy\"\n\nGermany's Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party has been designated as right-wing extremist by the country's federal office for the protection of the constitution. \"The ethnicity- and ancestry-based understanding of the people prevailing within the party is incompatible with the free democratic order,\" the domestic intelligence agency said in a statement. The German foreign ministry defended the decision after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the move \"tyranny in disguise\" and Vice-President JD Vance said the Berlin Wall was being rebuilt. The AfD came second in federal elections in February, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote.\n\nThe parliament, or Bundestag, will hold a vote next week to confirm conservative leader Friedrich Merz as chancellor, heading a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats. AfD joint leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said the decision was \"clearly politically motivated\" and a \"severe blow to German democracy\". They argued their party was being \"discredited and criminalised\" shortly before the change of government. The far-right AfD had already been placed under observation for suspected extremism in Germany, and the intelligence agency had also classed it as right-wing extremist in three states in the east, where its popularity is highest. The agency, or Verfassungsschutz, said specifically that the AfD did not consider citizens of a \"migration background from predominantly Muslim countries\" as equal members of the German people. AfD deputy chairman Stephan Brandner said the decision was \"complete nonsense, has absolutely nothing to do with law and order\". However, acting Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the agency had made a clear and unambiguous decision with \"no political influence whatsoever\", after a comprehensive review and a report of 1,100 pages. Bundestag Vice-President Andrea Lindholz said that as a designated right-wing extremist group the AfD should not be treated as other parties, especially in parliament. Because of their large number of seats, AfD members could be eligible to chair parliamentary committees, but Lindholz said that idea was now \"almost unthinkable\".\n\nAfter their election success, AfD leaders said the so-called firewall that had prevented other parties from working with them should end. \"Anyone who erects firewalls will get grilled behind them,\" said Tino Chrupalla. Having doubled its share of the vote in under four years, Chrupalla's party is still second in the opinion polls behind Merz's conservatives, despite several scandals, including one high-profile member being convicted of using banned Nazi slogans. Earlier this year Alice Weidel embraced the term \"remigration\", widely seen as meaning the mass deportation of people with a migrant background, although she rejected that definition. The AfD also attracted the support of leading figures in the Trump administration. Nine days before the election, US Vice-President JD Vance met Weidel in Munich and said there was no place for \"firewalls\", alleging that free speech was in retreat in Europe. Tech billionaire Elon Musk gave Weidel a long audience in a livestreamed chat on X and called on Germans to vote for the AfD. He then repeatedly posted his support for Weidel's party in the run-up to the election. On Friday JD Vance posted on X that \"the AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it.\" He also accused the \"German establishment\" of rebuilding the Berlin Wall - a reference to the barrier built in 1961 to separate East and West Berlin during the Cold War. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the decision taken by the German intelligence agency meant it had been given \"new powers to surveil the opposition. That's not democracy - it's tyranny in disguise\". This prompted a rare retort from the German Foreign Office. \"This is democracy,\" it posted on X. \"We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.\"",

    "body": "Labour narrowly wins North Tyneside mayoral race\n\n2 May 2025 Share Save Helen Richardson Political reporter, BBC North East and Cumbria Reporting from North Tyneside Austen Shakespeare Local Democracy Reporting Service Share Save\n\nBBC Karen Clark said the political picture nationally affected the vote in North Tyneside\n\nLabour has retained the mayoralty of North Tyneside after beating Reform UK by a thin margin. Karen Clark tallied 16,230 votes, putting her just 444 ahead of John Falkenstein. Clark, who effectively becomes leader of North Tyneside Council, said the close result was down to people using a protest vote over the national political landscape. The Conservatives, who are the official opposition on the local authority, came third.\n\nClark, who has been a councillor and cabinet member for a number of years, urged voters to look at \"what Labour has achieved on North Tyneside\" in the last 12 years. Thanking people for her election, she said she would \"work to the best of my abilities for the residents of this borough, as promised, to make our North Tyneside an even better place to live, work and visit\". On her battle against Reform UK, she said: \"I think it's in keeping with the national trend. \"It is always difficult when you're a party that is in government. \"The government has found itself in a difficult position after 14 years of Conservative government and has had to make difficult decisions. \"They know the whole situation of the finances in government.\"\n\nClark succeeds Dame Norma Redfearn, who had held the post since 2013. Tynemouth MP and Labour chief whip Alan Campbell said it had been \"important\" for the party to retain the mayoralty \"after the fantastic work Norma did\". He added he was \"grateful that voters across North Tyneside have put their faith\" in Clark for the next four years.\n\nFalkenstein told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: \"I think we have diminished what I believed to be a 30,000 majority. \"I cannot see how this is a real victory for the Labour Party.\" The former barrister, with experience in youth work, also stated that had his campaign had more resources and a longer than four-week start, the end result could well have been different. \"They [Labour] have not done themselves much justice.\" Liam Bones, who stood for the Conservatives, said the result was \"clearly indicative of a national sense of distrust towards the main parties\". He added: \"That is something we need to address if we are to regain the trust of the British people. \"Reform is a protest party, they stood in this election with no local policies and no understanding of how local services are actually delivered on the ground.\" Reform UK leader and MP Nigel Farage visited Newton Aycliffe in County Durham to celebrate his party taking control of the county council. In a speech, he said the party had came \"within a whisker\" of winning the North Tyneside mayoral contest in a Labour heartland and had \"frightened the life out of the governing Conservatives\" in Northumberland. The count had faced a delay owing to a discrepancy between previously announced vote and turnout figures. Initially announced as 31%, the turnout was later confirmed to be 33%, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Elsewhere, the Conservatives remain the biggest party on Northumberland County Council following the local elections there, but Reform UK came a close second. The council remains under no overall control.",

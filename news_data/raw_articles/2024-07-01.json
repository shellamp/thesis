    "body": "LONDON \u2014 The boss of British financial technology giant Revolut told CNBC he is optimistic about the company's chances of being granted a U.K. banking license, as a jump in users saw the firm report record full-year pre-tax profits.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNBC, Nikolay Storonsky, Revolut's CEO and co-founder, said that the company is feeling confident about securing its British bank license, after overcoming some key hurdles in its more than three-year-long journey toward gaining approval from regulators.\n\n\"Hopefully, sooner or later, we'll get it,\" Storonsky told CNBC via video call. Regulators are \"still working on it,\" he added, but so far haven't raised any outstanding concerns with the fintech.\n\nStoronsky noted that Revolut's huge size has meant that it's taken longer for the company to get its banking license approved than would have been the case for smaller companies. Several small financial institutions have been able to win approval for a banking license with few customers, he added.\n\n\"U.K. banking licenses are being approved for smaller companies,\" Storonsky said. \"They usually approve someone twice every year,\" and they typically tend to be smaller institutions. \"Of course, we are very large, so it takes extra time.\"\n\nRevolut is a licensed electronic money institution, or EMI, in the U.K. But it can't yet offer lending products such as credit cards, personal loans, or mortgages. A bank license would enable it to offer loans in the U.K. The firm has faced lengthy delays to its application, which it filed in 2021.\n\nOne key issue the company faced was with its share structure being inconsistent with the rulebook of the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is the regulatory body for the financial services industry that sits under the Bank of England.\n\nRevolut has multiple classes of shares and some of those share classes previously had preferential rights attached. One conditions set by the Bank of England for granting Revolut its U.K. banking license, was to collapse its six classes of shares into ordinary shares.\n\nRevolut has since resolved this, with the company striking a deal with Japanese tech investor SoftBank to transfer its shares in the firm to a unified class, relinquishing preferential rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. News of the resolution with SoftBank was first reported by the Financial Times.",

    "body": "Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, said he remains skeptical that artificial intelligence could soon make human jobs obsolete as he sees flaws in machine learning models applied in certain scenarios.\n\n\"We are at what is widely viewed as a real inflection point in the evolution of technology, with the rise of large language models. Some are convinced that within three years almost everything we do as humans will be done in one form or another by LLMs and other AI tools,\" Griffin said Friday during an event for Citadel's new class of interns in New York. \"For a number of reasons, I am not convinced that these models will achieve that type of breakthrough in the near future.\"\n\nThe rapid rise of AI has had the world pondering its far-reaching impact on society, including technology-induced job cuts. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, is among many who have repeatedly warned of the threats that AI poses to humanity. He has called AI \"more dangerous\" than nuclear weapons, saying there will come a point where \"no job is needed.\"\n\nGriffin, whose hedge fund and electronic market maker have been at the forefront of automation, said machine-learning tools do have their limits when it comes to adapting to changes.\n\n\"Machine learning models do not do well in a world where regimes shift. Self-driving cars don't work very well in the North due to snow. When the terrain changes, they have no idea what to do,\" Griffin said. \"Machine learning models do much better when there's consistency.\"\n\nStill, the billionaire investor thinks the power of advanced technology can't be dismissed in the long term, and he even sees cancer being eradicated one day because of it.\n\n\"The rise of computing power is allowing us to solve all kinds of problems that were just simply not solvable five, 10, 15 years ago,\" Griffin said. \"This is going to radically transform healthcare. We will end cancer as you know it in your lifetime.\"\n\nCitadel has long placed a great emphasis on hiring, not hesitant about putting responsibility into the hands of young employees and even interns, the CEO said.\n\nThe firm's internship program has become one of the most competitive in the country. More than 85,000 students applied for about 300 positions this year, reflecting an acceptance rate of less than 0.5%, which is lower than that of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\"The people we hire today are going to be the leaders of Citadel not in 30 or 40 years, but in just a few years,\" Griffin said.",

    "title": "Is the U.S. stock market too \u2018concentrated\u2019? Here\u2019s what to know",
    "body": "In this article META\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOGL\n\nAAPL\n\nNVDA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., displays the new Blackwell GPU chip during the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference on March 18, 2024. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. stock market has become dominated by about a handful of companies in recent years. Some experts question whether that \"concentrated\" market puts investors at risk, though others think such fears are likely overblown. Let's look at the S&P 500 , the most popular benchmark for U.S. stocks, as an illustration of the dynamics at play. The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500, the largest by market capitalization, accounted for 27% of the index at the end of 2023, nearly double the 14% share a decade earlier, according to a recent Morgan Stanley analysis.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn other words, for every $100 invested in the index, about $27 was funneled to the stocks of just 10 companies, up from $14 a decade ago. That rate of increase in concentration is the most rapid since 1950, according to Morgan Stanley. It has increased more in 2024: The top 10 stocks accounted for 37% of the index as of June 24, according to FactSet data. The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 make up about 31% of the index, it said.\n\n'A bit riskier than people realize'\n\nSome experts fear the largest U.S. companies are having an outsized influence on investors' portfolios. For example, the Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for more than half the S&P 500's gain in 2023, according to Morgan Stanley. Just as those stocks helped push up overall returns, a downturn in one or many of them could put a lot of investor money in jeopardy, some said. For example, Nvidia shed more than $500 billion in market value after a recent three-day sell-off in June, dragging down the S&P 500 into a multiday losing streak. (The stock has since recovered a bit.) The S&P 500's concentration \"is a bit riskier than people realize,\" said Charlie Fitzgerald III, a certified financial planner based in Orlando, Florida. \"Nearly a third of [the S&P 500] is sitting in seven stocks,\" he said. \"You're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.\"\n\nWhy stock concentration may not be a concern\n\nThe S&P 500 tracks stock prices of the 500 largest publicly traded companies. It does so by market capitalization: The larger a firm's stock valuation, the larger its weighting in the index. Tech-stock euphoria has helped drive higher concentration at the top, particularly among the Magnificent Seven. Collectively, Magnificent Seven stocks are up about 57% in the past year, as of market close on June 27 \u2014 more than double the 25% return of the whole S&P 500. Chip maker Nvidia's stock alone has tripled in that time. More from Personal Finance:\n\nAmericans struggle to shake off a 'vibecession'\n\nRetirement 'super savers' have the biggest 401(k) balances\n\nHouseholds have seen their buying power grow Despite the sharp increase in stock concentration, some market experts believe the concern may be overblown. For one, many investors are diversified beyond the U.S. stock market. It's \"rare\" for 401(k) investors to own just a U.S. stock fund, for example, according to a recent analysis by John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar. Many invest in target-date funds. A Vanguard TDF for near-retirees has a roughly 8% weighting to the Magnificent Seven, while one for younger investors who aim to retire in about three decades has a 13.5% weighting, Rekenthaler wrote in May.\n\nThere's precedent for this market concentration\n\nAdditionally, the current concentration isn't unprecedented by historical or global standards, according to the Morgan Stanley analysis. Research by finance professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton shows that the top 10 stocks made up about 30% of the U.S. stock market in the 1930s and early 1960s, and about 38% in 1900.\n\nThe stock market was as concentrated (or more) around the late 1950s and early '60s, for example, a period when \"stocks did just fine,\" said Rekenthaler, whose research examines markets since 1958. \"We've been here before,\" he said. \"And when we were here before, it wasn't particularly bad news.\" When there were big market crashes, they generally don't appear to have been associated with stock concentration, he added. When compared with the world's dozen largest stock markets, the U.S. market was the fourth-most-diversified at the end of 2023 \u2014 better than that of Switzerland, France, Australia, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan and Canada, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n'Sometimes you can be surprised'\n\nBig U.S. companies also generally seem to have the profits to back up their current lofty valuations, unlike during the peak of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s, experts said. Present-day market leaders \"generally have higher profit margins and returns on equity\" than those in 2000, according to a recent Goldman Sachs Research report. The Magnificent Seven \"are not pie-in-the-sky\" companies: They're generating \"tremendous\" revenue for investors, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. \"How much more gain can be made is the question,\" he added.\n\nYou're not diversifying when you're concentrating like this.

    "body": "The filing showed Roaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought just over 9 million shares \u2014 amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. That makes him the third-biggest Chewy shareholder, according to FactSet. Based on Friday's close, that stake is valued at more than $245 million.\n\nThe rally in Chewy shares lost steam Monday as traders reacted to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that showed meme stock trader \"Roaring Kitty\" took a stake in the pet food e-commerce retailer.\n\nThe SEC filing also included a section that read: \"Check the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat.\" There was an \"x\" next to a response that read: \"I am not a cat.\" This line was included in Gill's statement in a series of congressional hearings about 2021's GameStop trading mania.\n\nThe stock rallied more than 9% on Monday, but it quickly fell into negative territory in morning trading. Shares ended the day down 6.6%.\n\nChewy shares took a wild ride last week after Gill posted a picture on social media platform X of a cartoon dog that resembled Chewy's logo. The shares were up as much as 34% on Thursday but ended the day down slightly.\n\nCNBC emailed Chewy's public relations team seeking comment on the new shareholder.\n\nGill is known to be a champion of GameStop and has been stirring up trading in the video game company in the last few months. In mid-June, he disclosed a stake of 9.001 million GameStop shares after exiting his massive call options position. It's unclear if he sold his GameStop bet to fund the purchase of Chewy.\n\nGameStop shares fell more than 5% following the news.\n\n\n\nThere's a big connection between GameStop and Chewy. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was founder and the first CEO of Chewy, who was instrumental in PetSmart's takeover of Chewy in 2017 and its subsequent initial public offering in 2019.\n\nCohen joined the GameStop board of directors along with two other Chewy executives in January 2021, partly helping fuel the initial GameStop rally. He later took over as GameStop CEO in 2023, leading a turnaround in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer.\n\nIn a recent YouTube livestream, Gill said GameStop is in the second stage of a reinvention, and it has become a bet on Cohen himself, who's also been leading a pivot to e-commerce.\n\nThe investor was hit by a new class-action lawsuit filed Friday, alleging he engaged in securities fraud by manipulating GameStop's stock price through his online influence in May and June. The case was voluntarily dismissed on Monday.\n\nGill is a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. He came into the limelight after successfully encouraging retail investors to buy GameStop shares and call options in 2021 to squeeze out short-selling hedge funds.",

    "title": "Paramount is hunting for a streaming partner, could kick off a wave of deals",
    "body": "Paramount Global is holding talks with other entertainment companies about merging its Paramount+ streaming service with an existing platform. If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.\n\nParamount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.\n\nOne of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery , according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disney's suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didn't escalate.\n\nParamount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the company's co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.\n\n\"What they don't have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits,\" McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.\n\nA merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Global's balance sheet by giving it new ownership.\n\nWhile a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasn't been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldn't be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery's direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.\n\nMax has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didn't progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers,\" McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. \"Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global declined to comment.",

    "title": "Inside Starbucks' plans to improve stores for customers and baristas",
    "body": "watch now\n\nStarbucks cafes across the country are starting to change how they make drink orders, among other tweaks designed to reduce bottlenecks and long wait times that have dogged the chain. The overhaul comes as the coffee giant prepares for an anticipated swell of orders through its mobile app. At the heart of the plan is Starbucks' \"Siren Craft System,\" a series of processes that are aimed at making baristas' jobs easier and speeding up service times for customers. Starbucks said more than 10% of its 10,000 stores have already implemented the system, which includes changing the production order for hot and cold drinks. It will be in use across North America by the end of July, according to the company. Executives hope the changes will provide a much-needed jolt to Starbucks. In April, the company reported a disappointing second quarter, as U.S. same-store sales fell 3% and traffic dropped 7%. The coffee chain cut its 2024 outlook. Starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the mid-teens and said occasional customers came in less. CEO Laxman Narasimhan mentioned the need to make improvements to stores. Katie Young, senior vice president of store operations at Starbucks, said the most immediate shift that needed to happen in cafes was better handling the unexpected. \"It's the ability to flexibly respond to things we cannot predict,\" she told CNBC in an interview.\n\nStarbucks Coffee shop in Krakow, Poland on February 29, 2024. Beata Zawrzel | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThe store changes will be key this month, as Starbucks on Monday started opening up its app to non-rewards members, which the company believes will increase traffic and orders. Analyst Peter Saleh, managing director at BTIG, said, \"My sense is that they have a lot of demand in certain stores, and the footprint of the kitchen is so small, you have to find ways to be more efficient.\" Losing customers because of slow orders and other store frustrations could cost Starbucks at a particularly vulnerable time. Americans have become cost conscious in the face of ongoing inflation, and in some cases have pulled back on morning or afternoon beverages and snacks. Narasimhan in April said consumers are spending more cautiously. Starbucks has done something uncharacteristic in recent weeks, joining the stream of value offerings with a $5 food and beverage combo option. Communicating value to customers is also part of the plan to drum up business.\n\nThe Siren system\n\nStarbucks has been diagnosing the bottleneck issue for more than a year, since the company's reinvention plan rollout in 2022, said Young. At the time, Howard Schultz was at the helm, having returned during a burgeoning unionization movement and shifts in consumer preferences. The changes underway in cafes were first previewed that fall, to be rolled out in the years to come. Narasimhan took over for Schultz in March 2023. The Siren system processes were developed with worker feedback on which issues stopped them from creating beverages and connecting with customers. Starbucks said it plans to add a role akin to an expediter in a restaurant production line, a \"play caller\" who steps away from production and helps solve logjams in cafes, handling tasks such as restocking cups or helping when an unexpected crowd arrives. The company plans to train existing workers for the role or potentially add new baristas, if needed. \"One of the pain points we saw was [that] our espresso machine was often running all the time, and that was one of the things that kept our partners from being able to check in. And another thing we saw that you didn't necessarily know was which part of the store would get crowded,\" Young said. \"We needed to actually have a partner that was dedicated when things got busy to pulling out of production and just helping.\" Starbucks said it will also change the order in which beverages are made. Previously, cold drinks were prioritized from start to finish, even if a hot beverage order came in first, as pulling espresso shots was the last step. This could create a traffic jam in the drive-thru, for example, if a person ordered one of each beverage, as the cold item would be ready while the hot drink was still in production. Macoy McLaughlin, manager of Seattle's First and Walker Starbucks location, said producing beverages in the order they were placed allows for a faster, streamlined process. \"We actually have proper sequencing between our hot and cold bars, versus cold bars becoming as popular as ever, to really have a consistent experience for the customers. So we're actually making them in the order they're coming in,\" McLaughlin said, adding that the cafe feels busier, but customers in store and in the drive-thru are getting drinks faster. Baristas also will have more control over the company's digital production manager, an iPad system that controls the sequencing of orders in various channels from cafes, mobile orders and the drive-thru, the company said. Workers will have more flexibility over changing order priority.\n\nStarbucks app expands",

    "body": "In this article SPR\n\nBA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nBoeing Co. 737 fuselage sections sit on the assembly floor at Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nBoeing said Monday that it will buy back its struggling fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems in an all-stock deal that the plane maker has said will improve safety and quality control. It said it agreed to pay $37.25 a share in Boeing stock for Spirit, giving the plane supplier an equity value of $4.7 billion. Including Spirit's debt the deal has a transaction value of $8.3 billion Boeing said. Spirit's shares closed Friday at $32.87 a share, a market capitalization of about $3.8 billion. Boeing in March disclosed it was in talks to acquire the Wichita, Kansas-based company, weeks after a fuselage panel blew out midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 on an Alaska Airlines flight, sparking a fresh crisis for Boeing. Spirit makes the fuselages for the 737 and other parts, including sections of Boeing's 787 Dreamliners. In 2005, Boeing spun off operations in Kansas and Oklahoma that became the present-day Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing accounted for about 70% of Spirit's revenue last year, while roughly a quarter came from making parts for Boeing's main rival, Airbus, according to a securities filing. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has said he will step down at the end of the year, on Monday said bringing Spirit in-house will \"fully align\" the companies' production systems and workforces.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Among the many actions we're taking as a company, this is one of the most significant in demonstrating our unwavering commitment to strengthen quality and make certain that Boeing is the company the world needs it to be,\" Calhoun said in a message to employees. He said he expects the deal to close mid-2025, subject to approval by regulators, Spirit shareholders and the sale of Spirit's operations dedicated to Airbus planes. Spirit's CEO, Pat Shanahan, is considered a possible successor for Calhoun. Airbus, meanwhile, said Monday it has reached an agreement with Spirit so that the European aircraft manufacturer is compensated $559 million by Spirit to acquire its manufacturing lines dedicated to Airbus planes. Those include operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the wings and mid-fuselage of the A220 are produced, A220 pylons in Wichita and A350 fuselage sections in North Carolina. Airbus will pay $1 for the assets.\n\nMounting pressure",

Under that agreement, Boeing said it would pay $2.5 billion.\n\nThe DOJ revisited the agreement after a door panel blew out of a new 737 Max 9 midair during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, sparking a new safety and quality control crisis for one of the world's two suppliers of large commercial airplanes. The so-called deferred prosecution agreement was set to expire days before the door panel blew out.\n\nBoeing admitted in 2021 that two of its pilots defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration by concealing its addition of a new flight-control system to the planes before they were flown commercially. That system was later implicated in the two crashes.\n\nThe plea deal would require Boeing to pay an additional fine of about $247 million and call for the installation of an outside monitor on Boeing, according to Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers.

    "body": "Britain\u2019s next government is poised to benefit from easing pressure on household finances after a slowdown in inflation in stores and a fall in fuel prices, but costs remain \u201ctoo expensive\u201d for many families.\n\nFigures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show that annual UK shop price inflation cooled last month to 0.2%, down from 0.6% in May \u2013 the slowest pace since October 2021 \u2013 as retailers cut the prices of many of their key products, including butter and coffee.\n\nComing before Thursday\u2019s general election, separate figures from the RAC show that petrol and diesel prices fell for a second straight month in June to ease pressure on families affected by the cost of living crisis. The organisation said, however, that filling up on the forecourt was still \u201ctoo expensive\u201d in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nAccording to the RAC\u2019s monthly fuel watch, the average price of petrol in the UK at the end of June was just under 145p a litre, down from 148p at the start of the month. Diesel dropped from nearly 154p to about 150p.\n\n\u201cFuel prices are still nowhere near where they should be despite falling for the second consecutive month,\u201d the RAC said. It highlighted the lower cost of filling up in Northern Ireland, where petrol is 4.5p a litre cheaper on average and diesel 8p cheaper than in the rest of the UK.\n\nThe RAC\u2019s head of policy, Simon Williams, said: \u201cWhile it\u2019s good news prices at the pumps have fallen for the second month in a row, this also leaves a bad taste in the mouth because we know drivers in Great Britain are continuing to get a raw deal as both petrol and diesel are still much more expensive than in Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nHe said prices at forecourts owned and run by Shell and BP were the most expensive, highlighting Competition and Markets Authority data showing that Shell-owned sites were the most expensive in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe remain baffled how the very same fuel can be sold for such vastly different prices by the biggest retailers, whether they\u2019re run by supermarkets or the world\u2019s largest oil companies,\u201d he said.\n\nRishi Sunak has made lower inflation the cornerstone of the Conservatives\u2019 general election campaign after a return in the official headline rate to the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2% in May, down from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nThe shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, however, has said pressure on household finances remains \u201cacute\u201d as average prices remain significantly higher than before the cost of living crisis took hold.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The figures suggest average prices in UK shops are continuing to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.\n\nThe chief executive of the BRC, Helen Dickinson, said retailers had, however, cut the prices of some key products including butter and coffee. Non-food prices were also in deflation \u2013 meaning average prices are falling compared with a year earlier \u2013 as shops tried to boost their sales by discounting products.\n\n\u201cThis was particularly true for TVs with great deals to capitalise on the Euros fever,\u201d she said. \u201cWhoever wins Thursday\u2019s election will benefit from the work of retailers to cut their costs and prices, easing the cost of living for millions of households.\u201d",

    "title": "Greece introduces \u2018growth-oriented\u2019 six-day working week",
    "body": "Companies in countries worldwide may be toying with the idea of implementing shorter working weeks, but in Greece employees have been told that, henceforth, they can put in a sixth day of labour in an unorthodox step aimed at turbocharging productivity.\n\nAfter outpacing other Europeans in terms of economic growth, the nation once at the heart of the continent\u2019s worst financial crisis has bucked the trend again, introducing a 48-hour working week. The measure, decried as \u201cbarbaric\u201d by unions, takes effect from Monday.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense whatsoever,\u201d said Akis Sotiropoulos an executive committee member of the civil servants\u2019 union Adedy. \u201cWhen almost every other civilised country is enacting a four-day week, Greece decides to go the other way.\u201d\n\nThe pro-business government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, says the initiative was made necessary by the twin perils of a shrinking population and shortage of skilled workers. Prior to announcing the legislation \u2013 part of a broader set of labour laws passed last year \u2013 Mitsotakis described the projected demographic shift as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d. In an unprecedented exodus, about 500,000 mostly young educated Greeks are estimated to have emigrated since the near decade-long debt crisis erupted in late 2009.\n\nThe six-day scheme, officials say, will only apply to private businesses providing round-the-clock services. Under the extended working week, staff in select industries and manufacturing facilities will have the option of working an additional two hours a day or an extra eight-hour shift, rewarded with a top-up fee of 40% added to the daily wage.\n\nEither choice, the centre right government claims, will redress the issue of employees not being paid for overtime while also tackling the pervasive problem of undeclared work.\n\n\u201cThe nucleus of this legislation is worker-friendly, it is deeply growth-oriented,\u201d Mitsotakis said before the Greek parliament endorsed the law. \u201cAnd it brings Greece in line with the rest of Europe.\u201d\n\nBut the backlash has been fierce. In a country with almost no tradition of inspections in the workplace, critics contend the reform ultimately sounds the death knell of the five-day working week, not least because it enables employers to dictate whether a sixth day of labour is required.\n\nFor opponents, who have already taken to the streets in protest, the reform erodes legal protections and rolls back long-established workers\u2019 rights in the name of flexibility.\n\n\u201cIn reality this has been passed by a government ideologically committed to generating ever bigger profits for capital,\u201d said Sotiropoulos. \u201cBetter productivity comes with better work conditions, a better quality of life [for employees] and that, we now know, is about less hours not more.\u201d\n\nThe measure, he said, had been made possible partly because trade unions had also seen their power wane as a result of debt-stricken Athens enacting austerity measures in return for rescue funds during the country\u2019s financial crisis. Unions have long argued that overtime enables employers to hold back on hiring more staff.\n\nTrialled four-day week programmes have repeatedly shown increased levels of productivity with researchers attributing the outcome to improved levels of focus. Belgium in 2022 legislated to give employees the legal right to spread their working week over four days instead of five, and pilot schemes have been carried out in countries including the UK, Germany, Japan, South Africa and Canada.\n\nGreeks already work the longest hours in Europe, putting in an average 41 hours a week according to the EU\u2019s statistics agency, Eurostat, although surveys have also proved they get paid much less. The left-wing opposition has frequently decried \u201cBulgarian salaries in a country of British prices\u201d, claiming the phenomenon has only exacerbated the brain drain.\n\nPeople on pensions, who have also been encouraged to work under the legislation, have weighed into the debate.\n\n\u201cWhat the government is essentially saying is \u2018go and work longer, we\u2019ll turn a blind eye even if you\u2019re a pensioner,\u2019\u201d said Grigoris Kalomoiris who heads the union of retired teachers (Pesek).\n\n\u201cIt knows that the majority of Greeks, on an average monthly salary of \u20ac900, can only survive until the 20th of the month. This latest barbaric measure is not going to solve the fundamental problem of labour shortages and a lot of us feel it is very unfair to unemployed young Greeks who may never have a job.\u201d",

    "body": "Nick Hartley, who has died aged 80, was a respected economist and in the 1990s served as head of energy, economics and statistics at the Department of Trade and Industry.\n\nHis reputation was made as chief economist at Oftel (the Office of Telecommunications) for six years from 1984. He was then chief economist at the Department of the Environment (1990-94), before becoming head of energy, economics and statistics at the DTI, a post, he liked to point out, once held by Harold Wilson. In 1996, Nick joined the economic consultancy Oxera, from where he was seconded to the Cabinet Office to head up a report on energy policy.\n\nBorn in London, the only child of Nancy (nee Fulton), a dressmaker, and Edward Hartley, a publican, Nick went to St Clement Danes grammar school, Hammersmith, where he and I met in 1955. Sitting side by side in assembly for the headteacher\u2019s address to the new boys, he introduced himself: \u201cHello, I\u2019m Hartley, like the jam.\u201d\n\nIn the sixth form we were told by our economics teacher, Jack Harvey, to apply to St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, to study economics. We arrived in 1962 during a winter so cold that the River Granta froze, and Nick and I would walk on it to Grantchester.\n\nAfter graduating, Nick passed the civil service exam and became assistant principal at the Department for Education, where he worked for JAR Pimlott setting up polytechnics (1965-69). From there, he moved to the Treasury as an economic adviser (1969-84). He was seconded from the Treasury twice, in 1970-71 to do an MPhil at York University, and in 1974-77, to the Royal Commission on the Press.\n\nLatterly he was a companion of the Guild of St George, a charity for arts and crafts founded by John Ruskin who, Nick said, \u201cwas asking all the right questions about the way work and society should be organised\u201d. Nick travelled throughout Italy with Ruskin\u2019s work in mind, and artistic interests were central to his life.\n\nHe wrote several books, including The Prince of Privateers (2012), a life of one of his forebears who was on the British side in the American war of independence, and Monuments Officer (2012), a novel.\n\nAn enthusiastic theatregoer, as an undergraduate he played Lucky in a production of Waiting for Godot. After hearing Bob Dylan\u2019s second album in 1962 he became a lifelong fan of the musician. He was also a keen reader of the magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, so after watching a film at Cambridge, whether Hammer horror or Truffaut, he would give notes on \u201cauteur theory\u201d.\n\nThe novelist and playwright Nigel Williams described Nick as having a \u201cunique brisk theatricality\u201d. Perfect words with which to preserve my own memories of him, particularly as the briskness often involved the sort of expansive gestures that put any wine glasses on a table at risk.\n\nNick is survived by Jenny (nee Stern), whom he married in 1975, and by their sons, Ned and Gabriel, and granddaughters, Violet, Hazel and Hana.",

    "title": "Austerity was a disastrous political choice that we are still reeling from",
    "body": "Paul Krugman (How the \u2018unforced error\u2019 of austerity wrecked Britain, 28 June) hits the nail on the head when he says that there was no economic case for the austerity that the coalition government foisted on us in 2010, the effects of which are still with us. It was a political choice on the part of George Osborne and David Cameron to advance their class interest, cleverly camouflaged by stories of Labour profligacy when the economic crisis to which it was the alleged response was caused by a surfeit of financial deregulation advocated by Osborne and Cameron and supinely accepted by Labour.\n\nThe American political economist Clara E Mattei, in her 2022 book, The Capital Order: How Economists Invented Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism, showed how similar policies were applied in Britain and Italy after the first world war, essentially to keep workers in their place, and how in Italy they led to the rise of Mussolini and fascism. Let us be warned.\n\nProf Roger Brown\n\nSouthampton\n\nPaul Krugman is right about the impact of austerity on the UK economy \u2013 here are a couple of reasons why. First, those who advocate the shrinking of the state fail to appreciate how the economy is interdependent. Most public authorities require tendering for services. Generally, the private or voluntary sectors get the tender. So if the public sector is starved of finance and catches a cold, the private and voluntary sectors start to sneeze too.\n\nSecond, the assumption is that if the public sector is smaller, the private sector will take up the slack. This ignores the fact that the private sector\u2019s bottom line is its profitability and ability to satisfy its shareholders, not the public interest. In practice, this means that the private sector will cherry-pick the easy and profitable tasks, as with the failed privatisation of the probation service, while leaving anything difficult or unprofitable to the public sector.\n\nAlternatively, as with the failed privatisation of the railways, the private sector demands subsidies out of our taxes so that it can pay a dividend to its shareholders, thereby taking money out of the system that could otherwise be used to improve the infrastructure, reduce fares, or both.\n\nAusterity was an ideological choice by the coalition government. While I would have expected little better from the Conservatives, I would have hoped that their Liberal Democrat coalition partners would have drawn enough red lines to prevent the government from following through on its economic illiteracy and choking off the first signs of recovery from the 2007-08 crash. As it is, we\u2019ve suffered from the consequences ever since.\n\nDave Pollard\n\nLeicester\n\nPaul Krugman does an excellent job of exposing the disastrous consequences of 14 years of austerity for both society and the economy.

    "body": "6d ago 15.26 CEST Northern Irish politicians have raised concerns over the future of as many as 1,400 workers at the Spirit Aerosystems factory in Belfast, after its takeover by planemaker Airbus. Boeing has announced the takeover of Spirit Aerosystems as it tries to retake control of its supply chain following a series of production issues. As part of that deal Airbus will take over Spirit operations serving it, including in Belfast which makes wings and fuselages for the small A220 jet. However, the Unite union has said that 40% of the 3,600 workforce is employed on parts that are not related to Airbus projects, including work for Bombardier and Rolls-Royce. Airbus did not say whether it plans to continue that work. Local politicians are concerned that job losses may result at an historic factory that traces its history back to Short Brothers, the first company to make production aircraft. First minister Michelle O\u2019Neill and deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly released statements in which they said the government was working with the company to preserve the Belfast operations. Economy minister Conor Murphy said: \u201cI have been engaging with the company and union on the acquisition and will work with all key stakeholders to ensure that the future status of the highly skilled workforce is protected.\u201d Reuters reported: The leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party\u2019s (DUP) Gavin Robinson, said the sale represented only \u201ca partial solution\u201d. Steve Aiken, a member of the smaller Ulster Unionist Party, said it was an outcome \u201cneither management, workforce or the unions desired\u201d, calling on Northern Ireland\u2019s economy minister to intervene to ensure the entire business is retained. \u201cThe minister also needs to emphasis to Airbus the considerable investment the Northern Irish and UK governments have made in wing and aerostructure manufacturing in Belfast and that we will not be allowing our aircraft industry to be asset stripped and manufacturing moved elsewhere,\u201d Aiken added. Share\n\n6d ago 14.45 CEST German inflation drops as European Central Bank mulls further rate cuts German inflation has dropped slightly more than expected to 2.2% year-on-year in June, as the European Central Bank (ECB) considers whether to cut interest rates again. It dropped from 2.4% in May, and was slightly lower than the 2.3% forecast. The ECB has a 2% inflation target, but it has cut borrowing costs because it believes that inflationary pressure is easing. A further reduction in inflation could support that view. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, a Dutch investment bank, said the reading keeps the door open to further ECB rate cuts, but added that inflation \u201cremains sticky above 2%. He wrote: Looking ahead, the stickiness of inflation at slightly too high a level looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects are petering out while, at the same time, wages are increasing. With recent new wage demands, it is hard to see German wage growth coming down in the second half of the year. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, a September cut is likely. He said: said: Looking further ahead for Germany, we see scope for a further decline in headline inflation to below 2% by August, helping to get a 25 basis point rate cut over the line in September, before a rebound to just under 2.5% by the end of the year.

Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta has breached the EU\u2019s new digital laws with an advertising model that charges users for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, according to the European Commission. Meta launched a \u201cpay or consent\u201d model last year in an effort to comply with the bloc\u2019s data privacy rules, where users pay a monthly fee for an ad-free version of Facebook or Instagram that does not use their personal data for advertising purposes, writes the Guardian\u2019s Dan Milmo. Users who do not pay have, as part of the signing up process for the platforms, consented to their data being used to tailor personalised adverts that appear in their social media feeds. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive body, said the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act, which is designed to rein in big tech companies. The commission issued preliminary findings from an investigation into \u201cpay or consent\u201d on Monday and found the model \u201cforces users to consent\u201d to their data being collected from multiple platforms. It also does not allow users to choose a service that uses less of their data but is broadly similar to the \u201cwith adverts\u201d versions of Facebook and Instagram, the commission said.

Other unions have complained that there has been no progress in the last six weeks, but Unite suggested that Tata had changed stance. Tata has stuck to its position that the two blast furnaces must close this year. However, a plan backed by counterpart unions Community and GMB suggested keeping one furnace open for longer while readying a large investment in greener technology (such as a direct reduced iron plant) to convert iron ore to iron, which could then be fed into an electric arc furnace. That plan would preserve jobs on the blast furnaces for several years, and would then require more workers to run in the longer term \u2013 although nowhere near the 2,800 employees who could be out of work by the autumn. View image in fullscreen Unite union general secretary Sharon Graham. Photograph: Jacob King/PA Sharon Graham, Unite\u2019s general secretary, said: This is a significant development in the battle to protect jobs and the long-term future of steel making in South Wales. Investment from Labour secured by Unite will be key to the future of the site. This breakthrough would not have come about without the courage of our members at Port Talbot who were prepared to stand up and fight for their jobs. Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste. It is essential that these talks progress swiftly and in good faith with the focus on fresh investment and ensuring the long-term continuation of steel making in South Wales. Share\n\n6d ago 12.59 CEST Tata Steel had written to the three main unions representing steelworkers at Port Talbot offering more talks over its plans to cut 2,800 jobs as it closes the blast furnaces if the strike threat were removed. Owner of Port Talbot steelworks offers fresh talks as last furnace faces closure Read more The unions are hopeful that a Labour government would persuade Tata Steel to delay the closure of at least one blast furnace, preserving thousands of jobs for several years. Unite had threatened strike action from 8 July \u2013 after the planned closure of the first blast furnace. The other unions were hanging on for a Labour government after 4 July. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has already been in talks with the unions and the company in an effort to avert the closures. Alun Davies, national officer for Community, which represents most of the affected steelworkers, said: With thousands of jobs at stake, we welcome Unite\u2019s decision to withdraw their strike action and get back around the table with their sister steel unions. Tata confirmed that if the strike was called off they are ready to resume discussions on a potential [memorandum of understanding], through the multi-union steel committee which is chaired by Community. The truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members. Community will welcome resuming those discussions, but we regret that zero progress has been made since 22 May.

Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA A union representing some workers at Tata Steel\u2019s works in Port Talbot, south Wales, has suspended strikes after talks with the company. Unite union is understood to have suspended the strike threat after high-level talks between union officials and the company. Tata plans to close two blast furnaces at the site and shift towards much cleaner electric arc furnaces. However, unions want them to delay the closure \u2013 the first of which is due this week \u2013 to await a Labour government. Labour has said it will offer significant extra state subsidy to the steel industry, above the \u00a3500m deal agreed with Tata Steel by the Conservative government. A full statement from Unite is expected shortly. Share\n\n6d ago 12.16 CEST There has been a rush of manufacturing data today. The UK\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) from S&P Global suggests it is doing better than Europe. The PMI reading came in at 50.9 in June, still well into expansionary territory, in contrast to the two-year contraction in Europe. The reading was worse than the initial flash estimate of 51.4, and down slightly from May\u2019s 22-month high of 51.2. View image in fullscreen Output from the UK manufacturing sector has picked up in recent months. Photograph: S&P Global Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May\u2019s recent highs. The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins. In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe. However, that did not stop companies from making job and spending cuts and trying to run down inventories of unsold products, Dobson said. Inflation may be partly behind that: This is coming from a backdrop of renewed cost inflation pressure, with manufacturers\u2019 input prices now rising at the quickest pace since the start of 2023. This renewed upward lurch in manufacturing prices will likely add to concerns over the potential stubbornness of underlying inflationary pressures among hawkish rate setters at the Bank of England.

Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA It\u2019s a big news day for what remains of Northern Irish manufacturing: first, we had the news that Airbus will take over the historic Shorts aerospace operation from Spirit Aerosystems. And now there are renewed questions over the future of the nearby Harland & Wolff site, after its shares were suspended on the London\u2019s junior stock market. It has been forced to temporarily suspend trading in its shares after accounting issues meant it was unable to file audited accounts on time, the Guardian\u2019s Jack Simpson reports. It expects to publish the accounts in the week commencing 8 July, with share trading resuming at that point. The Belfast-based shipbuilder was plunged into uncertainty last month when it was reported that the UK government was witholding the approval of a \u00a3200m loan guarantee promised in December to shore up its finances.

That is still a notable move, but less than the nearly 3% surge earlier. The euro is up by 0.5% today against the US dollar at $1.0766. A hung parliament would make it more difficult for either the far-right National Rally (RN) or the leftwing New Popular Front coalition to win a majority and increase spending.

    "body": "Shares on the French stock market have risen after the first round of voting in the country\u2019s parliamentary election eased concerns about an outright victory for the rightwing National Rally (RN) party.\n\nThe euro rose against the dollar, while the risk premium investors demand for holding French government bonds fell as the markets took the view that the result could have been worse.\n\nBut despite a 1.5% jump in France\u2019s benchmark stock market measure \u2013 the Cac 40 \u2013 on Monday, shares have fallen 5% in the past month amid fears that Marine Le Pen\u2019s RN could still emerge from next Sunday\u2019s second round of voting with an overall majority.\n\nRN secured 33% of the vote, while the leftwing New Popular Front secured 28% and Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist bloc won the support of 20% of those who voted.\n\nAlex Everett, an investment manager at the fund management company abrdn, said: \u201cWe are not out of the woods yet. The National Rally exceeded expectations and may yet pick up the second-round votes for a relative or even absolute majority.\n\n\u201cIntense horse trading until Tuesday evening will likely see deals cut between the left and centre parties to try to derail this.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the gap between the interest rate (yield) on French and German bonds had widened to its highest since the eurozone debt crisis in 2012, but the spread narrowed slightly from 0.85 percentage points to 0.75 points after the results came in. The gap was less than 0.5 points before the snap election was called.\n\nKrishna Guha, an analyst at the US investment bank Evercore, said: \u201cThe vote is far from definitive but leans in favour of the less bad scenario of a hung parliament, political paralysis in Paris and chronic dysfunction at the EU level rather than the worse scenarios of an outright win for the far right or far left that might directly lead to a new European sovereign crisis.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "title": "The fastest data in the world",
    "body": "The fastest data in the world\n\n5 days ago By Chris Baraniuk , Technology Reporter Share\n\nsurf Mission accomplished for Edwin Verheul (left) and Joachim Opdenakker\n\nIn February, deep inside a warehouse at Cern, the Swiss home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest science experiment \u2013 two network engineers held their breath. And pressed a button. Suddenly, text on a black background flashed up on a screen in front of them. It had worked. \u201cThere was high-fiving involved,\u201d recalls Joachim Opdenakker at SURF, a Dutch IT association that works for educational and research institutions. \u201cIt was super-cool to see.\u201d He and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands. A data link that could reach speeds of 800 gigabits per second (Gbps) \u2013 or more than 11,000 times the average UK home broadband speed. The idea is to improve scientists\u2019 access to the results of LHC experiments. A subsequent test in March using special equipment on loan from Nokia proved the desired speeds were achievable. \u201cThis transponder that Nokia uses, it\u2019s like a celebrity,\u201d says Mr Verheul, explaining how the kit is booked up for use at various locations in advance. \u201cWe had limited time to do tests. If you have to postpone a week, then the transponder is gone.\u201d This amount of bandwidth, approaching one terabit per second, is extremely fast but some subsea cables are a few hundred times faster still \u2013 they use multiple fibre strands to achieve such speeds.\n\nNokia & Surf After its upgrade the Large Hadron Collider will produce five times as much data\n\nIn labs around the world, networking experts are coming up with fibre optic systems capable of pushing data around even more rapidly than this. They are reaching extraordinary speeds of many petabits per second (Pbps), or 300 million times the average UK home broadband connection. This is so fast that one can barely imagine how people will use such bandwidth in the future. But engineers are wasting no time in proving that it is possible. And they only want to go faster. The duplex cable (with cores that either send or receive) from Cern to data centres in The Netherlands is just shy of 1,650km (I,025 miles) long, snaking from Geneva to Paris, then Brussels, and finally Amsterdam. Part of the challenge in reaching 800 Gbps was in beaming pulses of light such a long way. \u201cDue to the distance, the power levels of that light decrease, so you have to amplify it at different locations,\u201d explains Mr Opdenakker. Every time one tiny subatomic particle smashes into another during experiments at the LHC, the impact generates staggering volumes of data \u2013 about one petabyte per second. That\u2019s enough to fill 220,000 DVDs. This is slimmed down for storage and study, but still requires hefty amounts of bandwidth. Plus, with an upgrade due by 2029, the LHC expects to produce even more scientific data than it does today. \u201cThe upgrade increases the number of collisions by at least a factor of five,\u201d says James Watt, senior vice president and general manager of optical networks at Nokia.\n\nA time when 800 Gbps seems slow may not be far away, however. In November, a team of researchers in Japan broke the world speed record for data transmission when they reached an astonishing 22.9 Pbps. That\u2019s enough bandwidth to supply every single person on the planet, and then a couple billion more, with a Netflix stream, says Chigo Okonkwo at Eindhoven University of Technology, who was involved in the work. In this case, a meaningless but huge stream of pseudorandom data was beamed over 13km of coiled fibre optic cable in a lab setting. Dr Okonkwo explains that the integrity of the data is analysed post-transfer to confirm it was sent as quickly as reported without accumulating too many errors. He also adds that the system he and colleagues used relied on multiple cores \u2013 a total of 19 cores inside one fibre cable. This is a new type of cable unlike the standard ones that connect many people\u2019s home to the internet.\n\nBut older fibre is expensive to dig up and replace. Extending its lifetime is useful, argues Wladek Forysiak at Aston University in the UK. He and colleagues have recently achieved speeds of around 402 terabits per second (Tbps) along a 50km-long optical fibre with just one core. That\u2019s about 5.7 million times faster than the average UK home broadband connection. \u201cI think it\u2019s a world best, we don\u2019t know of any results that are better than that,\u201d says Prof Forysiak. Their technique relies on using more wavelengths of light than usual when flashing data down an optical line. For this they use alternative forms of the electronic equipment that sends and receives signals over fibre optic cables but such a setup could be easier to install than replacing thousands of kilometres of the cable itself. Activities in the so-called metaverse might one day require extreme bandwidth, suggests Martin Creaner, director general of the World Broadband Association. His organisation expects home broadband connections to reach up to 50 Gbps by 2030. But reliability may be even more important than speed for some applications. \u201cFor remote robotic surgery across 3,000 miles\u2026 you absolutely do not want any scenario where the network goes down,\u201d says Mr Creaner. Dr Okonkwo adds that training AI will increasingly require moving huge datasets around. The faster this can be done, the better, he argues. And Ian Phillips, who works alongside Prof Forysiak, says bandwidth tends to find applications once it is available: \u201cHumanity finds a way of consuming it.\u201d\n\nTeleGeography Demand for bandwidth is growing surprisingly fast says Lane Burdette",

    "title": "Doctors worry that iodine deficiency \u2014 a dietary problem from the past \u2014 is coming back",
    "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The 13-year-old boy came to the clinic with a rapidly ballooning neck. Doctors were puzzled.\n\nTesting ruled out their first suspicion. But further tests pinpointed what they \u2014 and the boy \u2014 had been missing: iodine.\n\nA century ago, iodine deficiency affected kids across large swaths of the country. It essentially disappeared after some food makers started adding it to table salt, bread and some other foods, in one of the great public health success stories of the 20th century.\n\nBut today, people are getting less iodine because of changes in diet and food manufacturing.\n\nAlthough most people are still getting enough, researchers have increasingly been reporting low levels of iodine in pregnant women and other people, raising concerns about an impact on their newborns. And there is also a very small, but growing, number of reports of iodine deficiency in kids.\n\n\u201cThis needs to be on people\u2019s radar,\u201d said Dr. Monica Serrano-Gonzalez, a Brown University doctor who treated the boy in 2021 in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nThis article is part of AP\u2019s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.\n\n\n\nWhat is iodine?\n\nIodine is a trace element found in seawater and in some soils \u2014 mostly in coastal areas. A French chemist accidentally discovered it in 1811 when an experiment with seaweed ash created a purple puff of vapor. The name iodine comes from a Greek word meaning violet-colored.\n\nLater that century, scientists began to understand that people need certain amounts of iodine to regulate their metabolism and stay healthy, and that it\u2019s crucial in the development of brain function in children.\n\nOne sign of insufficient iodine is a swelling of the neck, known as a goiter. The thyroid gland in the neck uses iodine to produce hormones that regulate the heart rate and other body functions. When there\u2019s not enough iodine, the thyroid gland enlarges as it goes into overdrive to make up for the lack of iodine.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, goiter was very common in children in certain inland parts of the United States, especially in a \u201cgoiter belt\u201d that stretched from Appalachia and the Great Lakes to the northwest United States. Some of the kids were unusually short, deaf, intellectually stunted and had other symptoms of a syndrome once known as \u201ccretinism.\u201d\n\nAdding iodine to salt\n\nPublic health experts realized they couldn\u2019t solve the problem by feeding everyone seaweed and seafood, but they learned that iodine can essentially be sprayed on table salt. Iodized salt first became available in 1924. By the 1950s, more than 70% of U.S. households used iodized table salt. Bread and some other foods also were fortified with iodine, and iodine deficiency became rare.\n\nBut diets changed. Processed foods now make up a large part of the American diet, and though they contain a lot of salt, it\u2019s not iodized. Leading bread brands no longer add iodine. In the case of the 13-year-old boy, he has mild autism and was a fussy eater, mostly only eating specific brands of bread and peanut butter.\n\nAnd for people who do salt their food, the fashion now is to use kosher salt, Himalayan rock salt or other noniodized products.\n\n\u201cPeople have forgotten why there\u2019s iodine in salt,\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth Pearce of Boston Medical Center. She is a leader in the Iodine Global Network, a nongovernmental agency working to eliminate iodine deficiency disorders.\n\nShe noted a reported 50% drop in U.S. iodine levels in surveyed Americans between the 1970s and the 1990s.\n\nHow much iodine is enough?\n\nThough iodine consumption is falling overall, most Americans are still getting enough through their diet, experts say. But doctors worry that\u2019s not the case for women and children, who are most vulnerable to iodine deficiency.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical societies recommend that all pregnant and breastfeeding women get 150 micrograms of iodine each day. You can get that from one-half to three-quarters of a teaspoon of iodized table salt.\n\nIn the last 15 years or so, U.S. researchers have increasingly reported seeing mild iodine deficiency in pregnant women. A Michigan State University study of about 460 pregnant women in the city of Lansing found about a quarter of them were not getting enough.\n\nMany prenatal vitamins don\u2019t contain iodine, noted Jean Kerver, the study\u2019s lead author. That\u2019s why doctors recommend that pregnant or breastfeeding women check labels to ensure they are taking multivitamins or prenatal supplements with iodine.\n\nSome studies have linked even mild iodine deficiency to lower IQs and language delay in children, although there is debate about at exactly what levels problems start, Pearce said.\n\nExperts say there hasn\u2019t been enough research to establish what impact that iodine deficiency has actually been having on the U.S. population in recent years.\n\nSerrano-Gonzalez said she and her colleagues have seen four other cases in children in their clinic in Providence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned this may be increasing, especially in patients with restricted diets,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

    "title": "College tuition has fallen significantly at many schools",
    "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 The cost of college keeps spiraling ever higher, right?\n\nNot necessarily. New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago. And tuition increases at private colleges have finally slowed after years of hefty rises.\n\nFigures compiled by the nonprofit College Board indicate the average student attending an in-state public university this year faces a tuition bill of $11,610, which is down 4% from a decade earlier when taking inflation into account. But the real savings come in what the average student actually pays after getting grants and financial aid. That\u2019s down 40% over the decade, from $4,140 to $2,480 annually, according to the data.\n\nThat reduced cost means less borrowing. Just under half of students attending in-state public universities are graduating with some debt, down from 59% a decade earlier, according to the College Board figures. And among those who do borrow, the average loan balance has fallen by 17%, to $27,100.\n\nMeanwhile, at private colleges, tuition continues to rise, but at a much slower rate. It has increased 4% over the past decade, when taking inflation into account, to an average $43,350, according to the College Board. That\u2019s a big change from the two decades prior, when tuition increased 68%.\n\nCosts are coming down as Americans question whether college is worth the price. Surveys find that Americans are increasingly skeptical about the value of a degree, and the percentage of high school graduates heading to college has fallen to levels not seen in decades, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nYet research still finds that, over time, a degree pays off. Americans with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn a median of $2.8 million during their careers, 75% more than if they had only a high school diploma, according to research from Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a big factor in the cost reductions, said Jennifer Ma, an executive research scientist at the College Board and lead author of the study.\n\n\u201cWe know that during COVID, a lot of institutions \u2014 public and private \u2014 froze tuition,\u201d Ma said.\n\nAs states and the federal government responded to the pandemic, Ma said, they increased higher education funding, allowing colleges to reduce the cost of attendance. Some of that money has since expired, however, including an infusion of federal pandemic aid that was mostly used up by the end of 2022.\n\nCost was a major consideration in Kai Mattinson\u2019s decision to attend Northern Arizona University. It would have cost her about $39,000 annually to attend the public university but discounts and scholarships bring that down to between $15,000 and $20,000 for the 22-year-old senior from Nevada.\n\n\u201cI originally wanted to go to the University of Arizona, but when it came down to tuition and other cost, Northern Arizona University was the best option,\u201d said Mattinson, a physical education major who also works as a long-term substitute at a local elementary school.\n\nMany institutions have tried to limit cost increases. Purdue University in Indiana, for example, has frozen its annual in-state tuition at $9,992 for the past 13 years.\n\nMark Becker, the president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said he was pleased to see the new data.\n\n\u201cInstitutional efforts to control costs, combined with many states\u2019 efforts to increase investments in public universities and federal investment in the Pell Grant, have increased college affordability and enabled significant progress on tackling student debt,\u201d Becker said in a statement.\n\nCosts for those attending public two-year community colleges have fallen even more, by 9% over the past decade, according to the College Board data, which is broadly in line with federal figures collected by the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nStill, for parents paying for their children to attend out-of-state public universities or private colleges, the costs remain daunting \u2014 as much as $95,000 annually, in some cases. However, many institutions offer significant discounts to the sticker price for middle- and lower-income students.\n\nSome private colleges have been expanding their financial aid, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which in November announced undergraduates with a family income below $200,000 would no longer need to pay any tuition at all starting in the fall.\n\nOther private colleges are discounting tuition as a marketing move in an increasingly difficult environment. They face a dwindling pool of young adults, and students who are more wary of signing up for giant loans. Recruiting students is crucial for staying afloat as operational costs rise. After temporary relief thanks to federal money during the pandemic, many colleges have cut programs to try to keep costs under control.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Collin Binkley contributed to this report from Washington, D.C. Mumphrey reported from Phoenix.",

    "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 U.S. public health officials have been told to stop working with the World Health Organization, effective immediately.\n\nA U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official, John Nkengasong, sent a memo to senior leaders at the agency on Sunday night telling them that all staff who work with the WHO must immediately stop their collaborations and \u201cawait further guidance.\u201d\n\nExperts said the sudden stoppage was a surprise and would set back work on investigating and trying to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus and mpox in Africa, as well as brewing global threats. It also comes as health authorities around the world are monitoring bird flu outbreaks among U.S. livestock.\n\nThe Associated Press viewed a copy of Nkengasong\u2019s memo, which said the stop-work policy applied to \u201call CDC staff engaging with WHO through technical working groups, coordinating centers, advisory boards, cooperative agreements or other means \u2014 in person or virtual.\u201d It also says CDC staff are not allowed to visit WHO offices.\n\nPresident Donald Trump last week issued an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the U.S. from WHO, but that did not take immediate effect. Leaving WHO requires the approval of Congress and that the U.S. meets its financial obligations for the current fiscal year. The U.S. also must provide a one-year notice.\n\nHis administration also told federal health agencies to stop most communications with the public through at least the end of the month.\n\n\u201cStopping communications and meetings with WHO is a big problem,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern California public health expert who collaborates with WHO on work against sexually transmitted infections.\n\n\u201cPeople thought there would be a slow withdrawal. This has really caught everyone with their pants down,\u201d said Klausner, who said he learned of it from someone at CDC.\n\n\u201cTalking to WHO is a two-way street,\u201d he added, noting that the two agencies benefit from each other\u2019s expertise. The collaboration allows the U.S. to learn about new tests, new treatments and emerging outbreaks \u2014 information \u201cwhich can help us protect Americans abroad and at home,\u201d Klausner said.\n\nThe CDC details nearly 30 people to WHO and sends many millions of dollars to it through cooperative agreements. The U.S. agency also has some of the world\u2019s leading experts in infectious diseases and public health threats, and the two agencies\u2019 staffers are in daily contact about health dangers and how to stop them.\n\nThe collaboration halt isn\u2019t the only global health effect of Trump\u2019s executive orders. Last week, the president froze spending on another critical program, PEPFAR or the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.\n\nThe anti-HIV program is credited with saving 25 million lives, including those of 5.5 million children, since it was started by Republican President George W. Bush. It was included in a Trump administration freeze on foreign aid spending slated to last at least three months.\n\nPEPFAR provides HIV medication to more than 20 million people \u201cand stopping its funding essential stops their HIV treatment,\u201d International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement. \u201cIf that happens, people are going to die and HIV will resurge.\u201d\n\nA U.S. health official confirmed that the CDC was stopping its work with WHO. The person was not authorized to talk about the memo and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nA WHO spokesperson referred questions about the withdrawal to U.S. officials.\n\nOfficials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. And CDC officials didn\u2019t respond to the AP\u2019s request to speak with Nkengasong about the memo.\n\n___\n\nAP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "title": "Trump administration fires prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 cases and moves toward ousting FBI agents",
    "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday fired a group of prosecutors involved in the Jan. 6 criminal cases and demanded the names of FBI agents involved in those same probes so they can possibly be ousted, moves that reflect a White House determination to exert control over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees seen as insufficiently loyal.\n\nActing Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered the firings of the Jan. 6 prosecutors days after President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping clemency action benefiting the more than 1,500 people charged in the U.S. Capitol attack, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press. About two dozen employees at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington were terminated, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel issues.\n\nA separate memo by Bove identified more than a half-dozen FBI senior executives who were ordered to retire or be fired by Monday, and also asked for the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked on investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot \u2014 a list the bureau\u2019s acting director said could number in the thousands. Bove, who has defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration, said Justice Department officials would then carry out a \u201creview process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles, we are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what\u2019s in the best interest of the workforce and the American people \u2014 always,\u201d acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll wrote in a letter to the workforce.\n\nThe prosecutors fired in the D.C. U.S. attorney\u2019s office had been hired for temporary assignments to support the Jan. 6 cases, but were moved into permanent roles after Trump\u2019s presidential win in November, according to the memo obtained by the AP. Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, said he would not \u201ctolerate subversive personnel actions by the previous administration.\u201d\n\nAny mass firings at the FBI would be a major blow to the historic independence from the White House of the nation\u2019s premier federal law enforcement agency but would be in keeping with Trump\u2019s persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a broad termination by the Justice Department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team who investigated Trump.\n\nThe FBI Agents Association said the reported efforts to oust agents represented \u201coutrageous actions by acting officials\u201d that were \u201cfundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI Agents.\u201d\n\n\u201cDismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the Bureau\u2019s ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its new leadership for failure,\u201d the association said in a statement.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might take, but the bureau has a well-defined process for terminations and any abrupt action that bypasses that protocol could presumably open the door to a legal challenge.\n\nWhen pressed during his confirmation hearing Thursday, Trump\u2019s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the FBI\u2019s internal review processes for taking action against employees.\n\nAsked by Democratic Sen. Cory Booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that don\u2019t follow that standard process, Patel said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on right now over there, but I\u2019m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues, that I will honor the due process of the FBI.\u201d\n\nBefore he was nominated for the director\u2019s position, Patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about what he called anti-Trump \u201cconspirators\u201d in the government and news media who he said needed to be rooted out.\n\nTrump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and Justice Department over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the last four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia investigation and then replaced his second, Christopher Wray, just weeks after his win in November.\n\nAsked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the scrutiny of the agents, he said: \u201cNo, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody\u2019s never seen before. They came after a lot of people \u2014 like me \u2013 but they came after a lot of people.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf they fired some people over there, that\u2019s a good thing, because they were very bad.\u201d\n\nThe FBI and Smith\u2019s team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump\u2019s November presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.\n\nThe Justice Department also charged more than 1,500 Trump supporters in connection with the Capitol riot, though Trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them \u2014 including the ones convicted of violent crimes \u2014 through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments.\n\nThis week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives \u2014 including several executive assistant directors and agents in charge of big-city field offices \u2014 have been told to either resign or retire or be fired Monday.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller, Michael Kunzelman, Byron Tau and Jim Mustian contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Steven Soderbergh: \u2018I\u2019m the cockroach of this industry. I can survive any version of it\u2019",
    "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Steven Soderbergh isn\u2019t just the director and cinematographer of his latest film. He\u2019s also, in a way, its central character.\n\n\u201cPresence\u201d is filmed entirely from the POV of a ghost inside a home a family has just moved into. Soderbergh, who serves as his own cinematographer under the pseudonym Peter Andrews (his father\u2019s name), essentially performs as the presence, a floating point-of-view that watches as the violence that killed the mysterious ghost threatens to be repeated.\n\nFor even the prolific Soderbergh, the film, which opens Friday in theaters, was a unique challenge. He shot \u201cPresence\u201d with a small digital camera while wearing slippers to soften his steps.\n\nThe 62-year-old filmmaker recently met a reporter in a midtown Manhattan hotel in between finishing post-production on his other upcoming movie (\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d a thriller Focus Features will release March 14) and beginning production in a few weeks on his next project, a romantic comedy that he says \u201cfeels like a George Cukor movie.\u201d\n\nSoderbergh, whose films include \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d the \u201cOcean\u2019s 11\u201d movies, \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and \u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d tends to do a lot in small windows of time. \u201cPresence\u201d took 11 days to film.\n\nThat dexterous proficiency has made the ever-experimenting Soderbergh one of Hollywood\u2019s most widely respected evaluators of the movie business. In a wide-ranging conversation, he discussed why he thinks streaming is the most destructive force the movies have ever faced and why he\u2019s \u201cthe cockroach of this industry.\u201d\n\nAP: You use pseudonyms for yourself as a cinematographer and editor. Were you tempted to credit yourself as an actor for \u201cPresence\u201d?\n\nSODERBERGH: No, but what I did is subtle. For the first and only time Peter Andrews has a camera operator credit. That\u2019s not a credit that I typically take because I don\u2019t need it and I typically have another operator working with me. But I felt like this was a workout. It was tricky, but really fun. It was another level of performance anxiety because I ruined more takes than anyone else in the film by a larger factor. I was the one going: \u201cCut. I f\u2014ed that up. We got to go again.\u201d\n\nAP: You made this quickly and inexpensively, and then sold it to a distributor. Was it appealing to work outside the system?\n\nSODERBERGH: The beauty of projects at this scale is I can just do them without having to talk to anybody. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want notes. It\u2019s because it\u2019s just the brain trust and none of the psychic real estate is taken up by things that have nothing to do with what you\u2019re going to shoot. I went from that into a more traditional project in which a lot of psychic real estate gets taken up by the process of having a studio finance your movie. I like these people, it\u2019s just a lot of lawyers. Like, a lot of lawyers.\n\nAP: You\u2019ve called streaming the most destructive force in movie history. What most irks you about it?\n\nSODERBERGH: It removes a key reference point for an artist. It\u2019s helpful to know how something is doing, or how it did. You need to know that to calibrate whether you accomplished what you wanted to accomplish, whether you can work at a certain level. That\u2019s one of the most confusing things about it, the black box of it. Apart from the economic invisibility of what\u2019s going on there \u2014 the fact that we can\u2019t really look under the hood of how these streaming companies work economically \u2014 there\u2019s another kind of handrail that\u2019s missing that I find really helpful. At the end of the day, I, at least, want to know. The market will tell you how you\u2019re doing. I want to know that so I can adjust or go in another direction. Being irrelevant isn\u2019t very appealing. What is the overlap between what people seem to be responding to and what I like? Because I don\u2019t want to make these things and have nobody see them. I\u2019ve had enough people say, \u201cOh, did that come out?\u201d It\u2019s a public art form.\n\nAP: How do you suspect the audience is changing?\n\nSODERBERGH: The good news is, if you talk to Focus Features and Neon and A24, young people are going to the movies. This is the Letterboxd generation. That\u2019s fantastic. I hope that ripples outside the U.S. They are cine-literate and they expect something singular. They want the signature, they want the stamp of a filmmaker. And that\u2019s turning into a real business. One of the things, I think, we all need to do, but especially the people who cover the industry, is to stop using the studio metric for what a success is. That\u2019s not a template you should be applying to everything.\n\nAP: Do you ever lament that the movies that made you want to be a filmmaker like \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d and \u201cChinatown\u201d occupied a different place in the culture than today\u2019s films?\n\nSODERBERGH: There was a period of about 10 to 14 year where the best movies of the year were also the most popular movies of the year. That\u2019s not necessarily true anymore. You can pick one of the movies that\u2019s in the hunt this year and go: That\u2019s a \u201970s movie. That\u2019s as good and interesting as one of those. But it\u2019s not going to do the business that one of those would have done. It\u2019s the artist\u2019s job to adapt. When it comes to trying to control what people want to go see, you\u2019re now in a place like: \u201cIf I really wish hard, it won\u2019t rain.\u201d The weather is the weather. To a certain degree, the audience is a weather system. Luckily because of the way I began, I\u2019m the cockroach of this industry. I can survive any version of it.\n\nAP: You\u2019ve described feeling a need to immediately \u201cannihilate\u201d whatever you just made by starting on something vastly different.\n\nSODERBERGH: Yeah, when you see \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s different.\u201d There are more shots in the first four minutes of \u201cBlack Bag\u201d than the entirety of \u201cPresence.\u201d It\u2019s a different thing and it has different demands.\n\nAP: It\u2019s not exhausting to reinvent yourself every movie?\n\nSODERBERGH: No, it feels more like a natural evolution and a natural response in the sense of: I want to be a different filmmaker for this. I don\u2019t want to know the outcome. If you have a conversation with a filmmaker who says they have \u201cfigured things out,\u201d you should run in the other direction. It\u2019s like: You\u2019re deluded and you have a very superficial understanding of what this art form demands if you\u2019re not humbled by what it asks of you to be distinctive.\n\nAP: Do you feel you\u2019ve gotten closer? There might not be a filmmaker alive who\u2019s tried more ways to make a movie than you have.\n\nSODERBERGH: No, I still feel like I\u2019m reaching for something I quite possibly won\u2019t ever grasp and maybe shouldn\u2019t. As frustrating as it may be to feel like I\u2019ve never made a thing that is at the level of one of my heroes made, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I did feel that. Do you stop, then? The movie \u201cCome and See,\u201d that guy got to basically go: \u201cThat\u2019s my mic drop.\u201d I\u2019ve never made anything approaching that.\n\nAP: It wouldn\u2019t be the only film I\u2019d suggest, but I think \u201cOut of Sight\u201d is pretty darn perfect.\n\nSODERBERGH: Oh, I\u2019m very happy with that film. I\u2019m very proud of that film. I can\u2019t say there\u2019s much in it that I\u2019d go back and change. That said, it\u2019s not \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d Or \u201cThe Third Man.\u201d By my standards, I don\u2019t look at it and go, \u201cThat\u2019s as good as \u2018The Third Man.\u2019\u201d I\u2019m good at pushing myself into areas that are slightly beyond my comfort zone, but I also understand what my limitations are. I\u2019m inherently not a grandiose thinker about myself or my work. That\u2019s a critical component to some of the films I\u2019m talking about that I think are amazing. I could never make \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d I don\u2019t think of myself as a filmmaker the way Francis (Ford Coppola) thinks of himself. That\u2019s not: He should be like me or I should be like him. It\u2019s just how we\u2019re built. I\u2019m more earthbound, I guess is the word. And that\u2019s what I like and what I\u2019m good at.\n\nAP: Do you have any idea why?\n\nSODERBERGH: I think it\u2019s the way I was born and the way I was raised. And the people who were around me when I was younger who mentored me. I just don\u2019t think I was born with the grandiosity gene and there was nobody around me who would have cultivated that even if I had shown signs. Going to Sundance last year with \u201cPresence\u201d was really gratifying. If you\u2019d told me 35 years later you\u2019re going to come back here (where \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape\u201d premiered in 1989) with a movie that people are interested in seeing, I would have wept.",
    "clean_body": "new york ap \u2014 steven soderbergh isn\u2019t just the director and cinematographer of his latest film he\u2019s also in a way its central character \u201cpresence\u201d is filmed entirely from the pov of a ghost inside a home a family has just moved into soderbergh who serves as his own cinematographer under the pseudonym peter andrews his father\u2019s name essentially performs as the presence a floating pointofview that watches as the violence that killed the mysterious ghost threatens to be repeated for even the prolific soderbergh the film which opens friday in theaters was a unique challenge he shot \u201cpresence\u201d with a small digital camera while wearing slippers to soften his steps the 62yearold filmmaker recently met a reporter in a midtown manhattan hotel in between finishing postproduction on his other upcoming movie \u201cblack bag\u201d a thriller focus features will release march 14 and beginning production in a few weeks on his next project a romantic comedy that he says \u201cfeels like a george cukor movie\u201d soderbergh whose films include \u201cout of sight\u201d the \u201cocean\u2019s 11\u201d movies \u201cmagic mike\u201d and \u201cerin brockovich\u201d tends to do a lot in small windows of time \u201cpresence\u201d took 11 days to film that dexterous proficiency has made the everexperimenting soderbergh one of hollywood\u2019s most widely respected evaluators of the movie business in a wideranging conversation he discussed why he thinks streaming is the most destructive force the movies have ever faced and why he\u2019s \u201cthe cockroach of this industry\u201d ap you use pseudonyms for yourself as a cinematographer and editor were you tempted to credit yourself as an actor for \u201cpresence\u201d soderbergh no but what i did is subtle for the first and only time peter andrews has a camera operator credit that\u2019s not a credit that i typically take because i don\u2019t need it and i typically have another operator working with me but i felt like this was a workout it was tricky but really fun it was another level of performance anxiety because i ruined more takes than anyone else in the film by a larger factor i was the one going \u201ccut i f\u2014ed that up we got to go again\u201d ap you made this quickly and inexpensively and then sold it to a distributor was it appealing to work outside the system soderbergh the beauty of projects at this scale is i can just do them without having to talk to anybody it\u2019s not because i don\u2019t want notes it\u2019s because it\u2019s just the brain trust and none of the psychic real estate is taken up by things that have nothing to do with what you\u2019re going to shoot i went from that into a more traditional project in which a lot of psychic real estate gets taken up by the process of having a studio finance your movie i like these people it\u2019s just a lot of lawyers like a lot of lawyers ap you\u2019ve called streaming the most destructive force in movie history what most irks you about it soderbergh it removes a key reference point for an artist it\u2019s helpful to know how something is doing or how it

The latest uptick brought the four-week average of initial claims to its highest level since August 2023.\n\nAlso, Americans are staying unemployed for longer: Continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received benefits for at least a week or more, rose to their highest level since November 2021.\n\nLuke Tilley, Wilmington Trust\u2019s chief economist, told CNN he is closely watching an underlying datapoint of the monthly jobs report: Unemployed persons by reason for unemployment.\n\n\u201cOn a three-month average basis, it\u2019s up about 200,000 people from last year,\u201d Tilley said. \u201cAnd that metric of permanent job losers, year-over-year, is almost never positive in an expansion.

Gox, the Japanese bitcoin exchange that collapsed into bankruptcy a decade ago, on Friday said the company has begun to make payments in bitcoin and in bitcoin cash to some of its creditors. The announcement added that repayments to other users of the hacked exchange would be \"promptly made\" if they meet certain conditions, including undergoing account verification, as well as subscribing to one of the designated digital asset exchanges through which the bankruptcy estate is facilitating disbursements in digital tokens. \"We ask eligible rehabilitation creditors to wait for a while,\" continues the statement. The price of bitcoin has plunged nearly 6% in the past 24 hours. Customers of the Tokyo-based exchange have been waiting 10 years to get their money back.\n\nWhat is Mt. Gox?\n\nOnce the world's largest crypto trading venues, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in February 2014 after a series of heists that saw up to 950,000 bitcoin \u2014 worth upward of $58 billion at today's prices \u2014 vanish. Mt. Gox blamed the bitcoin disappearance on a bug in the cryptocurrency's framework. While users were receiving incomplete transaction messages when accessing the exchange, coins may have actually been illicitly moved by hackers out of their accounts, Mt. Gox said. After declaring bankruptcy, 140,000 of the missing bitcoin were recovered, which means roughly $9 billion worth of bitcoin will be returned to owners, in today's prices. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $600 at the time of the bankruptcy. Today, it is worth more than $54,000 \u2014 an almost 9,000% increase. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, on Thursday and Friday, Mt. Gox moved billions of dollars in bitcoin from its crypto wallets ahead of the repayment memo. More than 47,000 bitcoins worth $2.7 billion were moved out of an offline cryptocurrency wallet associated with Mt. Gox, Arkham Intelligence said Friday. A portion of the funds, worth $84.9 million, was sent to Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank, which is listed among the platforms supporting repayments to Mt. Gox users, according to Arkham Intelligence. A further $63.6 million of bitcoin was sent to an unknown counterparty, which Arkham Intelligence said was \"likely a listed repayments exchange.\" Mt. Gox wallets continue to hold 138,985 bitcoins, worth around $7.5 billion at current prices, according to Arkham Intelligence, meaning billions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency are yet to be paid out.\n\nHow will this affect bitcoin?",

    "body": "watch now\n\nThe U.S. economy again added slightly more jobs than expected in June though the unemployment rate increased, the Labor Department reported Friday. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 206,000 for the month, better than the 200,000 Dow Jones forecast though less than the downwardly revised gain of 218,000 in May, which was cut sharply from the initial estimate of 272,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate unexpectedly climbed to 4.1%, tied for the highest level since October 2021 and providing a conflicting sign for Federal Reserve officials weighing their next move on monetary policy. The forecast had been for the jobless rate to hold steady at 4%. \"It's a soft landing kind of report,\" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"This does support the idea that [the Fed] will cut relatively soon, and we continue to think September is the most likely.\" The increase in the unemployment rate came as the labor force participation rate, which indicates the level of working-age people who are employed or actively searching for a job, rose to 62.6%, up 0.1 percentage point. The so-called prime age rate, which focuses on those between ages 25 and 54, rose to 83.7%, its highest in more than 22 years. A broader unemployment rate which counts discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons held steady at 7.4%. Household employment, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, rose by 116,000. The household survey also showed a decrease of 28,000, in full-time workers and an increase of 50,000 in part-time workers.\n\nThough June job creation topped expectations, it was due in large part to a 70,000 surge in government jobs. Also, health care, a consistent leader by sector, added 49,000 while social assistance contributed 34,000 and construction was up 27,000. Several sectors saw declines, including professional and business services (-17.000) and retail (-9,000). On wages, average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month and 3.9% from a year ago, both in line with estimates. The average work week was steady at 34.3 hours. Stock market futures nudged higher following the report while Treasury yields were negative.

    "body": "In this article GFS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nThe semiconductor industry is recruiting workers in a tight labor market as the competition for talent ramps up and funding from the CHIPS and Science Act designed to spur domestic production continues to be dispersed. It is also staring down a projected shortfall of as much as one million workers in the broader U.S. economy by 2030 as generative artificial intelligence adds fuel to the in-demand sector. The U.S. chips industry is expected face a shortage of 67,000 technicians, computer scientists and engineers by 2030, while the broader U.S. economy is set to have a gap of 1.4 million such workers, according to a 2023 study from the Semiconductor Industry Association. A separate study from Deloitte found the talent crunch in the semiconductor space could get even worse due to the global economic environment and ongoing supply chain issues.\n\nA wafer sorter inside the GlobalFoundries semiconductor manufacturing facility in Malta, New York, on June 18, 2024. Cindy Schultz | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nGlobalFoundries , the third-largest chipmaker globally, is casting a wide net to recruit talent. The company has sought out veteran candidates, along with candidates from its own workforce reentry program and an initiative for women in construction. The company creates chips for everyday products from electronics and phones to autos, in addition to components for space and defense. Major clients include General Motors and Lockheed Martin . In 2021, the company launched the sector's first registered apprenticeship program, which is full time and paid with benefits, with training at no cost to the apprentice. It is completed in two years or less, and requires only a high school diploma or equivalent and interest in the mechanical field. Some 50 apprentices have gone through the program so far, the company said. It has recruited graduates with technical associate degrees from regional community colleges and veterans transitioning out of the military for the program. GlobalFoundries is working to fill hundreds of roles at a time worldwide, and hires thousands annually, a pace it expects to continue, Chief People Officer Pradheepa Raman told CNBC in an interview. Raman said keeping the same size workforce is \"not an option\" for the industry as demand soars. The needs range from technicians to product managers and corporate roles. \"It's why we are very, very aggressive when it comes to our workforce development efforts,\" Raman said. \"And if you're not getting traditional talent, [the solution is] cross-training talent, identifying alternate talent pools, people who are doing things in different fields, showing them that this is a very welcoming set of opportunities that exists within the semiconductor industry, is our approach.\"\n\nThe GlobalFoundries semiconductor manufacturing facility in Malta, New York, on June 18, 2024. Cindy Schultz | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nWorkers also have room for advancement, and training and retaining existing workers is key in this competitive environment. Morgan Woods, 28, started out in Malta, New York, at GlobalFoundries' fab facility as a technician in 2021. Woods has now moved into a training and development analyst role with the company, overseeing training for technicians, engineers and management, plus ensuring compliance. Woods said compliance is crucial as the company expands into the automotive space, working with GM. \"As the demand for the microchips increases, we definitely need more manpower to help support the constant rollout of microchips and meeting our daily targets,\" Woods said. Woods has taken advantage of a benefit from GlobalFoundries launched in May, allowing eligible U.S.-based employees and new hires to receive a tax-free lifetime total of $28,500 toward student debt. It includes qualified loans for all degree types and credit-based certificate programs offered by U.S. universities and colleges. So far, the number of applicants has topped 200, exceeding expectations, the company said. \"By participating in this program, I will be in a much better financial position to purchase a home within the next few years, as well as look at expanding my family and having children,\" Woods said. Beyond helping to create roles in engineering and computer science, funding from the CHIPS and Science Act will also bolster growth for GlobalFoundries' manufacturing fabs in New York and Vermont. In February, the company announced $1.5 billion in planned CHIPS funding to expand manufacturing capacity. It projects that funding, along with local and state money, will help create some 1,500 manufacturing jobs and 9,000 construction jobs over the lifetime of planned projects. Manufacturing and construction have faced worker shortages of their own recently, and aim to lure new and younger hires to the field. \"We believe the challenges that we face in recruiting can be solved through an ecosystem approach of workforce development and making our organization one of the best places to work through the benefits offerings that we have been providing,\" Raman said.\n\nwatch now",

Courtesy: Magnolia Pictures\n\nScammers exploit 'fear and urgency'\n\nScams like the one Thelma fell victim to are increasingly common, experts say. Imposter fraud was the most common type of fraud reported to the FTC in 2023, and the agency saw an increase in reports of business and government impersonators. Social media is fertile ground for harvesting content for these scams. With advancements in generative AI, a scammer can run just a few seconds of audio from a TikTok video to make the harvested voice say whatever they want, according to computer security company McAfee. \"Everybody should know that deep fakes are becoming more and more popular and common and easier to do, and there are whole industries built around scamming people,\" said Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and physician who founded Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida. Typically, AI voice scams mimic distress calls. It could be someone stuck on the side of the road after their car broke down or someone calling from jail in a foreign country claiming they need bail money. The common denominator is that it's coming from someone you care about who needs money \"fast.\" A 2023 survey from McAfee found that 25% of adults have experienced a similar AI voice scam \u2014 and the company says 77% of victims have lost money as a result. The company polled 7,054 adults in seven countries, including 1,009 in the United States. Thelma's age in the movie was a factor in her vulnerability. \"They target the elderly, because as we get older, we lose cognitive flexibility, meaning that we can't make decisions as quickly, and so it takes us longer to think through things,\" said McClanahan, who is a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council. \"And so these scamsters use techniques like fear and urgency to try to get you to act immediately.\"\n\nBut older adults aren't the only ones at risk; younger people who spend more time online are increasingly vulnerable, CFP Andrew Sivertsen said. \"You think about Gen Z and young millennials, I mean, just the number of impressions that they have online with technology is just exponentially more than seniors and so they're falling victim to a higher number of scams,\" said Sivertsen, a senior planner at The Planning Center in Moline, Illinois.\n\nProtecting loved ones and yourself from scams\n\nSpeaking with an older loved one about the risk of being scammed can be difficult, and much of the movie showed Thelma grappling with her own autonomy in the situation. After falling for the scam, she had to come to terms with the fact that she needed help with technology and taking care of herself, but she wasn't ready to give up her freedom. \"You have to find a way to kind of process the feelings of watching somebody go through something like this, but also to do so in a thoughtful way, so that when you do talk to them about it, you don't kind of add to the shame and embarrassment that I believe is probably already there,\" Margolin said.\n\nwatch now",

    "title": "Rent a car for a road trip, or drive your own? 5 things to consider",
    "body": "Patchareeporn Sakoolchai | Moment | Getty Images\n\nSummer is the season of road trips. A record 70.9 million Americans are expected to travel by car during the July Fourth holiday week alone, according to AAA. For some car owners, it might be more financially savvy to rent a vehicle for a road trip than use their own, experts said. \"It's going to be pretty dependent on a variety of factors,\" said Greg Brannon, AAA's director of automotive engineering research. Those factors include your current vehicle's gas mileage, the distance you'll be driving, how long you'll be gone, whether you lease or own and how big your vehicle is, among other things, according to Toyota. Here are some key considerations.\n\nThe car's specs\n\nVehicle capacity is a \"no-brainer\" when it comes to choosing whether to rent or not, said Brian Moody, executive editor of Autotrader, a car shopping site. It's easiest to say, \"I have a five-passenger car and I have eight going on the trip,\" Moody said. Drivers may also need to compare specifications, such as the necessity of a two-wheel-drive versus a four-wheel-drive car, as well as storage space for luggage and gear.\n\nOperating costs\n\nThis is where the math gets a bit trickier. There are many financial costs, some obvious and others less so. Drivers would need to compare total rental costs \u2014 the daily rental rate and potential add-ons like insurance \u2014 versus those of operating their own car. \"Most people will be shocked at what it actually costs to own and operate their car,\" Brannon said.\n\nwatch now\n\nFueling costs, such as gasoline or electric charging, are a financial consideration for both renters and car owners. It may be possible to rent a more fuel-efficient vehicle and save money. For instance, renting a car that gets 40 miles per gallon versus a currently owned one that gets 20 mpg would, all else equal, cut fuel costs in half. \"If you have an old car that's fuel inefficient, it might make sense to rent something,\" Moody said.\n\nRental costs\n\nThe average rental cost $42 a day in the second quarter of 2024, with most travelers looking for four-day rentals, according to travel site Hopper. The daily rate can be higher or lower based on factors like rental company, car type, and pickup and drop-off location. The cost of rental car insurance might add $30 to $61 to the daily rate, depending on insurance type, according to Allianz Travel, citing MarketWatch data. More from Personal Finance:\n\nIs inflation Biden's or Trump's fault?\n\nRomance scams cost consumers $1.14 billion in 2023\n\nFAFSA issues force hard choices for students Renters who want car insurance may not need to buy additional coverage through the rental company. Car owners may already get full coverage on a rental via their own car insurance policies, or may have some coverage through credit-card benefits, Brannon said. \"Call your insurance agent and double-check your coverage,\" he said. \"You can save yourself a bunch of money by not double-insuring the vehicle if you don't need to.\"\n\nDepreciation and mileage caps on leases\n\nAlistair Berg | Digitalvision | Getty Images\n\nAdditionally, car owners who lease a vehicle should weigh factors like mileage caps before taking a long road trip. For example, the typical lease imposes financial penalties on drivers who put more than 12,000 miles a year on their vehicle, according to Kelley Blue Book. The cost for exceeding that cap is usually about 20 to 30 cents per mile, KBB said. (At 30 cents, a driver would pay $300 for every 1,000 miles over the mileage limit.) There are also depreciation costs to consider. Depreciation causes a car to lose value over time. Cars famously lose about 10% to 15% of their value once they drive it off the lot, Brannon said.\n\nwatch now\n\nDepreciation is \"the biggest expense of owning a vehicle,\" Brannon said. And that's why it matters for road trips, he says. \"The more miles you put on a vehicle the more it depreciates,\" Brannon said. Every mile puts wear and tear on the engine, tires and other moving parts, according to Allianz. Depreciation affects all cars differently. The average car depreciates at about 20 cents a mile, according to Toyota. For shorter road trips \u2014 say, 1,000 to 1,500 miles in a given year \u2014 depreciation might not be a big deal relative to rental prices, said Autotrader's Moody. Depreciation generally only matters for people who plan to sell or trade in their vehicle in the future.\n\nState of the vehicle\n\nUnforeseen repairs can be costly: The average repair order on the road is \"well in excess of $500,\" excluding towing costs, Brannon said, citing AAA data. The odds of a breakdown are lower with rental cars, which are generally newer models, Moody said. The average used car on the road is about 12 years old, he explained.",

Setting a landmark precedent, NATO last month agreed to allow Budapest's nonparticipation in the coalition's deepening support of Ukraine \u2014 in exchange for Hungary not blocking such initiatives.\n\nHungary will soon become the only country in Europe able to carry out dialogue with both Russia and Ukraine, Orban told Putin during the Friday visit, according to comments reported by Reuters and Russian state news agency Tass.\n\nThe trip to Moscow is the second stop on Orban's self-described \"peace mission,\" after the Hungarian leader carried out his first wartime visit to Ukraine on Tuesday to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nAfter the engagement, Zelenskyy said that the pair had held talks over \"the most fundamental issues of our neighborly relations \u2013 trade, cross-border cooperation, infrastructure, and energy,\" and noted that the dialogue could set the foundation for \"a new bilateral document\" between the two nations.\n\nOrban also stressed Budapest's intentions to improve ties with Ukraine, while calling on Zelenskyy to consider a cease-fire in the hostilities with Russia in a bid to accelerate peace talks, Reuters reported.\n\n\"You cannot make peace from a comfortable armchair in Brussels,\" Orban said Friday in a social media post. \"Even if the rotating EU-Presidency has no mandate to negotiate on behalf of the EU, we cannot sit back and wait for the war to miraculously end. We will serve as an important tool in making the first steps towards #peace. This is what our peace mission is about.\"\n\nSeveral peace initiatives have been floated \u2014 including Zelenskyy's 10-point plan, a Chinese proposal and Putin's own conditions to entertain negotiations \u2014 without gaining traction.\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said Kyiv was not advised of Orban's trip to Moscow, which was made \"without agreement or coordination with Ukraine,\" according to a Google-translated statement.\n\n\"We remind you that for our country the principle of 'no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine' remains inviolable and we call on all countries to strictly adhere to it,\" the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said, adding that the \"only realistic way to restore a just peace\" remains Zelenskyy's peace formula.\n\nOrban's trip to Moscow has also drawn the wrath of European officials, who questioned his authority to represent the bloc.",

Cameron Smith | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 Britain elected its first Labour prime minister in 14 years, with a landslide victory for the opposition party during the July 4 elections. Keir Starmer takes the country's top job from Rishi Sunak with projections suggesting his left-of-center party could have a majority of around 170 seats. Starmer has had a rapid political ascent after entering the U.K. Parliament less than a decade ago. But many Britons still know little about the man who has positioned himself as the country's change candidate. CNBC takes a look at the U.K.'s new prime minister and his platform.\n\nHuman rights lawyer-turned-politician\n\nStarmer was born in 1962 in London to a father who worked as a toolmaker and a mother who was a nurse. The 61-year-old has often referenced his modest beginnings as a point of connection with British voters and says his mother's lifelong battle with a severe illness gave him a deep gratitude for the National Health Service (NHS). Starmer was the first in his family to go to university, studying law at the University of Leeds. After postgraduate studies at the University of Oxford, Starmer began working as a barrister \u2014 or British trial attorney \u2014 in 1987, taking on high-profile cases, including against Shell, McDonald's and former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's mine closures.\n\nwatch now\n\nStarmer also served as a human rights advisor during former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's landmark Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement. In 2008, a year after marrying his wife, Victoria, Starmer became director of public prosecutions, putting him at the head of the U.K.'s Crown Prosecution Service. Starmer was knighted in 2014 for his services to criminal justice and was elected to Parliament the following year, serving as immigration minister and Brexit minister for the opposition. In 2020, he was appointed Labour leader and instigated a major overhaul of the party after the resignation of Jeremy Corbyn, who led the faction to a record loss in the 2019 election.\n\nIn his 2024 election campaign, Starmer touted a \"decade of national renewal\" for the country following what Labour has described as years of spending cuts and falling living standards under the Tories. In the party's election manifesto, published last month, Starmer outlined spending measures to create a new publicly owned energy company, reduce NHS waiting times, build new homes and renationalize rail services.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer gives a speech as he visits the Vale Inn on June 27, 2024 in Macclesfield, United Kingdom. Cameron Smith | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBut he also positioned himself as staunchly pro-business, continuing his yearslong charm offensive on traditionally right-leaning voters with plans for \"wealth creation\" and a National Wealth Fund. \"Economic growth and social justice must go hand in hand,\" Starmer said at the launch event of the manifesto. Labour has outlined five long-term missions if it comes to power: drive economic growth, invest in green energy, overhaul the NHS, create safer streets and deliver \"opportunity\" through a new skills agenda. To aid these goals, Starmer is planning a radical shake-up of government ministries, Labour officials told the Financial Times. Starmer, who voted for the Remain campaign not to depart the European Union in the U.K.'s 2016 EU referendum, has also pledged to improve the \"botched\" U.K.-EU deal, including in areas such as trade, research and security. However, he has insisted there is no case for Britain to rejoin the bloc.\n\nPublic image problem?\n\nDespite his change agenda, Starmer is seen by many as an establishment figure, lacking the charisma of other politicians. A YouGov poll from earlier this year ranked him behind Reform's Nigel Farage in terms of public popularity \u2014 and his rating fell further among younger voters.\n\nwatch now",

    "body": "General view of Bishopsgate in the City of London, the capital's financial district. The UK economy has reportedly seen faster growth than initially estimated in early 2024. Vuk Valcic | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\n\n\nThe U.K.'s Labour Party won big in Thursday's election and is now set to take over from the Conservatives after 14 years, at a time when economic uncertainty is still rife in the country. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index climbed 0.4% as investors reacted to the election results on Friday, while the British pound made only light gains. The FTSE 350 household goods and home construction index was up about 1%. Looking at individual stocks within the sector, Persimmon shares rose 2.9%, while Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Bellway were all up roughly 2%. Interest rates remain elevated in the U.K. as the central bank has battled high inflation following the Covid-19 slowdown. The two main political parties ran on different economic and financial manifestos during the election campaign that would likely have different consequences for the investing environment. The Labour party's pledge, for example, to increase taxes on the compensation that private equity fund managers received raised a few eyebrows, and led to questions on what this could mean more broadly. Speaking to CNBC, a selection of experts weighed in on the potential impact the change of government could have on U.K. investment.\n\nwatch now\n\nStock markets\n\nThe arrival of a new Labour government hasn't moved markets all that much yet but analysts expect U.K. assets to become more attractive from here on out. In a note Friday, analysts at Jefferies said, despite concerns raised by a strong showing for the right-wing Reform UK Party, the Labour Party's U.K. election win would help make the U.K. appear \"relatively stable.\" This, in combination with regulatory reform, \"could raise the attractiveness of UK assets,\" Jefferies' analysts wrote in a research note. James McManus, chief investment officer at Nutmeg, meanwhile told CNBC that the vast majority of the time, \"markets don't really care\" about elections. \"Historical data shows us that elections and their results rarely move markets when the expected outcome is delivered.\" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, broadly echoed McManus' comments in a note published this week, but added that there could be some impact on the economy. \"A widely predicted Labour win in the UK could usher in an era of greater stability for the UK \u2026 which should help bolster investor sentiment towards the UK,\" she said. In recent years the U.K.'s political landscape has been characterized by frequent leadership changes, which at times have led to market turmoil \u2014 especially during former PM Liz Truss' brief premiership.\n\nwatch now\n\nSome sectors \u2014 and therefore specific stocks \u2014 could also be affected, Streeter pointed out. Pressure could be added to the utilities sector as Labour plans to increase fines for water companies which are already being weighed down by high costs. Meanwhile, the party's pledge to boost the country's defense budget could see U.K. airspace stocks benefit from additional spending on new technology and equipment.\n\nProperty markets and housing\n\nPlans from all parties to build more houses could impact the property and housing sector, Richard Donnell, executive director for research at Zoopla, told CNBC. \"Investors would welcome this focus on home building,\" he said. \"What investors want is more focus on housing and delivering the homes the nation needs and leveraging in as much private investment as possible to create an attractive investment for more capital and to support the ambitions of the new Government.\" Some housebuilding stocks may also see a boost due to Labour's plans to build new, affordable homes, Hargreaves Lansdown noted.\n\nwatch now\n\nWider economic developments will however also be a factor, according to Nutmeg's McManus. As interest rates are set to fall, so will mortgage rates, which could lead to more people buying or selling homes, he said, adding that this could also have knock-on effects for other businesses like furniture and DIY shops. Aynsley Lammin, an equity analyst at Investec, said Labour's plan to restore mandatory housebuilding targets would be a \"quick win\" for the sector that should boost planning and supply. RBC's head of European capital goods research told CNBC's Silvia Amaro Friday agreed that the house building sector stands to be a major beneficiary of the Labour Party's landslide victory.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"It's front and center great for house builders, great for the wider building supply sector, bricks,\" Mark Fielding said, pointing to two driving factors. \"Two big factors: firstly a return to mandated targets for house building supporting 1.5 million new homes over the next five years, which would be a big positive, and secondly hopes on planning reforms, targeting to get that done.\" That will in turn allow for faster planning processes and potentially for additional central government intervention to press ahead with more house approvals, according to Fielding, who noted that investor focus will otherwise now narrow on the Labour Party's ability to deliver on broader economic growth. \"U.K. bank stocks in the end are one of the biggest proxies for U.K. economic growth,\" he said.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe British pound\n\nStrategists and economists predict the British pound will not be impacted strongly by the election. If results are as expected, attention will shift away from the U.K. election quickly, Shreyas Gopal, strategist, and Sanjay Raja, senior economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note published Wednesday. \"For EUR/GBP, this then means turning attention to the election across the channel [in France], and then the forthcoming UK data in mid-July that will determine whether the BoE are able to pull the trigger on a first rate cut in early August,\" they said.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn the longer-term, there are also not \"huge risks\" for the pound under a Labour government, Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING, told CNBC. Potential renegotiations of Brexit deals would, if anything, be more pro-growth under Labour, and risks of excessive government spending are also low, he explained. But the pound could still be on course for a difficult time, Pesole suggested. \"We see the pound depreciating against the euro in the next 24 months primarily on the back of our view for larger Bank of England cuts compared to the ECB,\" he said. Higher taxes in the U.K. could also weaken its currency \u2014 but those would likely come regardless of the election outcome, according to Pesole.\n\nBond markets",

    "body": "watch now\n\nTwo winters ago, we vacationed to a hot-spot resort in the Caribbean with our family. Around the perimeter of its casino concourse, a variety of attractions buzzed for our consumption. We found an art installation to climb on, faux floral arches to position ourselves around and giant milkshakes topped with full desserts in sugar-rimmed glasses to sip from \u2014 well, not before the photos. Photos came first. To be honest, it felt less like a vacation and more like a visit to one of those immersive exhibits where everything's a photo-op and everyone you know has taken the same exact photos there. This is because they have taken the same exact photos there, and doubtless, geotagged their location.\n\nSocial media has transformed the reason we take photos on vacation. According to a survey conducted by Forbes Advisor, 82% of Gen Zers and 57% of millennials visit certain destinations because they saw them on social media. Many people post their travels in real time, engaging in a perpetual game of capture and share. According to the same survey, 74% of respondents feel some kind of pressure to imitate the travel content they consume online. Without question, we fell into that camp on our vacation. It was performative, exhausting, and above all, absurdly expensive. Don't get us wrong \u2014 we love social media for connecting with friends, drawing inspiration from others, and yes, even drooling a bit over beautiful destinations. But its hazard lies in clouding your better judgment when making financial decisions that might not be worth it in real life. This summer, a little more than half of Americans are planning to take a vacation, according to a Bankrate survey. Out of those travelers, 36% are prepared to take on debt to pay for it. Costs continue to rise across the board for flights, accommodations, even dining, and consumer buying is keeping pace. In the process, many travelers are losing sight of their long-term goals to capture something that feels important in a moment but isn't at all.\n\n'Pics or it didn't happen' comes at a cost\n\nMorsa Images | Digitalvision | Getty Images\n\nYou lose the plot \u2014 and your money \u2014 when what's supposed to be for you becomes about showcasing it for everyone else. It's a classic case of \"pics or it didn't happen.\" You can end up spending more time focused on the wrong elements of your vacation, like positioning yourself for the perfect sunset photo-op but then not watching the actual sunset, or filming half of a concert with the camera flipped around on you. We've all done this; it's no one person's fault. But is snapping those pics worth paying inflated prices? Going into credit card debt? Stretching your annual vacation budget to accommodate the resort everyone claims to love so much? Without core memories affixed to those photos, they are not nearly as valuable. The casino resort was crowded, the restaurants priced like Las Vegas, the waits long for almost anything. We had a lovely time together as a family, but almost nothing we snapped a photo of contributed to that time.\n\nDial into vacation elements that are important to you\n\nWhen you're trying to budget and plan for your summer vacation, come up with your cost ceiling first. See how much your proposed travel and accommodation costs eat into that number. If they almost reach your limit, maybe that version of the trip is too expensive. You want to leave room to experience the vacation, and those experiences will come at a cost. In terms of what you choose to do, put yourselves at the center of those decisions. What will cause you to depart for home from your vacation saying, that felt really good? Dial into the things that are important to you and your family \u2014 not what's trending online. If you're into food, focus on the food. If you're into adventure, invest in that. When you set your itinerary with intention, you find the perspective you need to scale back on the superfluous things that cause you to overspend.",

Toby Melville | Reuters\n\nLONDON \u2014 The U.K.'s Labour Party won a huge parliamentary majority in the country's general election, but a quirk of the British electoral system means it did so with just 34% of the total votes cast. Results show that the opposition Labour Party has won 412 parliamentary seats of the total 650, with just two seats yet to be declared. This translates as roughly 63% of the total seats, but Labour has won just 34% of the total \"popular\" vote, while the Conservative Party has secured nearly 24% of that number. Meanwhile, smaller parties including the centrist Liberal Democrats, right-wing Reform U.K. and the Greens took nearly 43% of the popular vote but gained just less than 18% of the seats available.\n\nwatch now\n\nThis was aided by the U.K.'s \"first past the post\" system, where voters choose only one single candidate from their local list in each of the country's 650 constituencies. The person with the most votes in each constituency is elected as a Member of Parliament to the House of Commons, the U.K.'s lower house. The party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons usually forms the new government and its leader becomes prime minister. Unlike in other voting systems, there are no second rounds or ranking of first- and second-choice candidates, meaning it can be difficult for smaller parties to translate an increased share of the popular vote into parliamentary seats. Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at AXA Investment Managers, said in a note released Friday that this election \"marks a warning sign for the political system, [as] a large majority has been delivered on a little more than a third of the popular vote.\" She pointed out that voter turnout was just 60% for this election. That represents the second-lowest turnout rate since 1918, after 2001, when turnout fell to 59.4%. This 7.6% fall in turnout from 2019 indicated a \"broader political disconnect,\" said Dickens. \"The scale of Labour's majority is as much an outcome of the peculiarities of our voting system and an interplay of split votes and the [collapse of the] Scottish National Party (SNP), rather than of a resurgence in Labour's popularity,\" she said.\n\nwatch now",

    "body": "Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets launched from the Gaza Strip, as seen from Ashkelon, in southern Israel, October 20, 2023. Amir Cohen | Reuters\n\nOn Thursday morning, Hezbollah said it launched 200 rockets into Israel \u2014 one of its largest attacks yet \u2014 following the Israeli assassination of one of the group's senior commanders, further ramping up fears over a potential full-blown war between the two heavily armed adversaries. The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and U.K., said it fired at 10 Israeli military sites using a \"squadron of drones.\" Israel's military said that \"numerous projectiles and suspicious aerial targets\" breached its territory, many of which were intercepted, and that there were no casualties. Hezbollah has launched thousands of rockets into Israel in the nearly nine months since the latter began its war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza on Oct. 7. The rockets fired from Lebanon have killed 18 Israeli soldiers and 10 civilians, Israel says, while Israeli shelling has killed some 300 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and around 80 civilians, according to a Reuters tally. The relatively low number of Israeli casualties is thanks to the country's Iron Dome, a mobile all-weather defense system designed to protect Israeli territory by launching guided missiles to intercept incoming rockets and other short-range threats in midair. It has a success rate of around 90%, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The system, which became fully operational in March 2011 and has been upgraded several times since, has \"successfully prevented countless rockets from hitting Israeli communities,\" Israel's Defense Ministry says. Originally produced in Israel, the Iron Dome was developed by state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. backing \u2014 and Washington continues to provide funding for it today.\n\nAn Iron Dome launcher fires an interceptor missile as rockets are fired from Gaza, in Ashkelon, Israel May 10, 2023. Amir Cohen | Reuters\n\nThe Iron Dome also intercepts around 90% of the near-daily rocket attacks from Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza, the IDF claims. Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 37,000 people in the besieged strip, according to Palestinian health authorities, in a bloody offensive triggered by Hamas' terror attack on Oct. 7 that killed roughly 1,200 people in Israel and took an additional 253 hostage, 116 of whom have been freed. But as Israel faces the prospect of a two-front war \u2014 with Hamas to its south and Hezbollah to its north \u2014 and with the reality that Hezbollah has an enormous arsenal of missiles and is estimated to have 10 times the military capability of Hamas, the question is: can the Iron Dome be overrun?\n\n'Payloads that Hamas could not dream of'\n\nAn all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah would be devastating for both sides. Already, at least 150,000 residents of southern Lebanon and northern Israel have been evacuated from their homes and are internally displaced because of the regular cross-border fire. Retired Israel Defense Forces Col. Miri Eisin, who directs the International Institute for Counterterrorism in Israel, said the Iron Dome would not be overrun in the sense of failing to work altogether; rather, its interception success rate will likely fall amid large-scale missile attacks, meaning more damage to Israeli infrastructure and more casualties. \"Our capabilities to intercept are very high. But the percentage will go down and that means that they will be able to hit and do damage in the heart of Israel,\" Eisin said, adding that could include vital infrastructure like power plants and the country's Tel Aviv international airport. Hezbollah \"has payloads that Hamas could not dream of,\" she said. \"I would say that there's an expectation of hundreds of killed, of thousands of casualties, and of a very challenging time period at the local level.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nThe Lebanese Shiite organization, which was born in 1982 during Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon with funding from Iran, is now considered one of the most heavily armed nonstate groups in the world. \"Most estimates credibly put Hizbullah's missile and rocket stockpile at 150,000,\" Victor Tricaud, a senior analyst at consulting firm Control Risks, told CNBC. Hamas' rockets and missiles, by comparison, are estimated to number in the tens of thousands. More significantly, Tricaud said, Hezbollah has far more advanced weapons systems than Hamas, including Iranian-supplied guided Fateh missiles as well as drones. \"Such munitions would stand significantly greater chances to evade Israel's air defense systems \u2026 and would be likely to inflict significant damage to critical economic infrastructure across Israel,\" he said. A full-blown war would also be highly destructive for Lebanon, which is in the midst of an economic and political crisis and whose infrastructure is wholly unprepared for a new war. A major Israeli incursion and the damage it would bring, particularly to the Hezbollah stronghold of southern Lebanon, could threaten the group's standing and support there.\n\n'A hell of a lot more damage'\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah went to war in 2006, in a 34-day conflict that was claimed as a victory by Hezbollah and seen as a strategic failure in Israel. A report by Israel's Reichman University titled \"Fire and blood: The chilling reality facing Israel in a war with Hezbollah\" outlined a scenario in which Hezbollah would fire 2,500 to 3,000 missiles and rockets a day for several weeks targeting Israeli military and civilian sites. For reference, Hezbollah fired an estimated 4,000 rockets at Israel over the course of the entire 2006 war.\n\nPro-Iranian Hezbollah militants chant slogans as they walk in the beginning of the funeral procession of the party top commander Wissam tawil in the southern Lebanese village of Khirbit Selem. Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\n\nAccording to Phillip Smyth, an expert on Iranian proxies and former senior fellow at the Washington Institute, Hezbollah's rates of fire and number of rockets launched are already \"far outpacing\" what was seen during the 2006 war.",

    "title": "Over $170 billion wiped off cryptocurrencies as market tanks on Mt. Gox bitcoin payout fears",
    "body": "watch now\n\nCryptocurrencies plunged Friday as investors focused on the payout of nearly $9 billion to users of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. Bitcoin's price was last lower by nearly 3% to $56,571.00, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day, the world's biggest cryptocurrency had slumped as low as $53,513.55, marking its first time trading below the $55,000 level since Feb. 27. Rival token ether, meanwhile, sank around 5% to $2,971.68. At one point in time, the entire cryptocurrency market had shed more than $170 billion in combined market capitalization in a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko data. On Friday, the trustee for the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate, Nobuaki Kobayashi, said in a statement that it had begun making repayments in bitcoin and bitcoin cash to some of the creditors through a number of designated crypto exchanges. Mt. Gox's trustee didn't specify how much money had been transferred to these exchanges.\n\nHe noted that the remaining funds would be returned to creditors once a series of conditions is met, including confirming the validity of registered accounts and completing discussions between the trustee and the designated crypto exchanges. The trustee is still working to ensure repayments \"can be made safely and securely,\" Kobayashi wrote, urging \"eligible rehabilitation creditors to wait for a while.\" It comes after a small amount of bitcoin was moved out of wallets associated with Mt. Gox, according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, with the largest movement being a $24 transfer to the Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank. Bitbank is among the recipients listed to support repayments. Recently, the world's largest cryptocurrency has been pressured by news of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox preparing the distribution of around $9 billion worth of coins to users. This dumping of coins onto the market is expected to lead to some significant selling action. The slump in crypto prices led to hefty liquidations in the derivatives markets, according to crypto data firm Coinglass, which suggests that 229,755 traders had their positions worth a combined $639.58 million liquidated in the past 24 hours. Of this sum, $540.46 million represented long trades \u2014 financial positions taken when an investor expects the price of an asset to appreciate over the long term. Also pressuring crypto markets, the German government on Thursday sold roughly 3,000 bitcoins \u2014 worth approximately $175 million as of today's prices \u2014 from a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movie2k, according to Arkham Intelligence. Arkham, which is tracking Germany's bitcoin wallet, noted the government still holds more than 40,000 bitcoins worth over $2 billion.\n\nwatch now\n\nIndustry insiders still expect bitcoin prices to climb again toward the end of the year, once the expected near-term selling pressure from the Mt. Gox repayments lifts. Analysts at crypto data and research firm CCData said in a report Tuesday that bitcoin hadn't yet reached the top of its current appreciation cycle and is likely to hit a fresh all-time high. Historical market \"cycles\" have shown that bitcoin's so-called halving event \u2014 which cuts the supply of new bitcoins to the market \u2014 has always preceded a period of price expansion that can last between 12 and 18 months \"before producing a cycle top,\" CCData said in its report. The last bitcoin halving took place on April 19 this year, so those historical time frames have yet to pass. \"Moreover, we have observed a decline in trading activity on centralised exchanges for nearly two months following the halving event in previous cycles, which seems to have mirrored this cycle. This suggests that the current cycle could expand further into 2025,\" CCData said.\n\nwatch now\n\nTom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday that he still sees bitcoin hitting $150,000 despite the \"overhang\" from Mt. Gox's upcoming disbursement of tokens to creditors. \"If I was invested in crypto, knowing that one of the biggest overhangs is going to disappear in July, I'd think it's a reason to actually expect a pretty sharp rebound in the second half,\" Lee said. Investors are still awaiting the launch of an ether exchange-traded fund in the U.S., which would follow the approval of the first U.S. spot bitcoin ETF in January. In May, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule change that would pave the way for ETFs that buy and hold ether . VanEck, BlackRock, Bitwise and Galaxy Digital are among the companies looking to launch their own ether ETFs.",

Leon Neal | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nLONDON - Outgoing UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Friday said he will step down as the leader of the Conservative Party after the opposition Labour Party secured a landslide victory in Thursday's nationwide election. Sunak announced he will step down as the leader of the Conservative Party as soon as the formal arrangements for selecting his successor are in place. He then had an audience with King Charles III where he tendered his resignation as prime minister. \"This is a difficult day, at the end of a number of difficult days,\" Sunak said during a final address outside of Downing Street. \"But I leave this job honored to have been your prime minister.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nSpeaking to crowds on 10 Downing Street, Sunak said: \"I have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change, and yours is the only judgment that matters.\" The Conservative Party suffered its lowest result, in terms of seats, in its post-war history. The former leader and chancellor of the exchequer conceded defeat early Friday morning after Labour passed the threshold needed to govern alone. Keir Starmer's Labour Party won its second-largest majority after former Prime Minister Tony Blair's 179-seat majority in 1997. Sunak held on to his seat in Richmond and Northallerton after winning 47.5% of the votes - a 15% drop from the previous election. But other high-profile members of parliament in the election such as Grant Shapps, the party's defense minister, and Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, failed to secure another term.\n\nwatch now",

    "body": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz smiles during a question time on July 3, 2024 at the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) in Berlin.\n\nGerman government leaders on Friday agreed on an outline for the country's 2025 budget after intense negotiations to bridge a gap worth billions of euros.\n\n\"With this budget, we are creating security and stability at a time that is marked by uneasiness and uncertainty,\" Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, according to a CNBC translation.\n\nScholz flagged several key points from the budget, which he said included \"record investment.\"\n\n\"It is about a strong defense, a strong [German army] that offers protection from the aggressive tyrants of our time. Therefore, we will fulfil NATO's 2% goal every year,\" he said, with reference to the pledge of NATO allies to commit at least 2% of their GDP to defense spending.\n\nHe added that significantly more money would be allocated to housebuilding and affordable homes, noting that the sum would be in the \"high billions.\"\n\nAn economic growth initiative has been planned alongside the budget, Scholz said. Among other items, it aims to boost the incentive for investment, reduce bureaucracy, and ensure affordable energy, he explained.\n\nThe budget bill still faces a few months of scrutiny. Scholz on Friday confirmed that his cabinet will sign off on the plans when it next meets on July 17. But the budget must then be discussed by the German parliament after its summer break, before being finalized later in the year.\n\nNegotiations have been ongoing for weeks after spending plans shared by individual ministries exceeded constraints by billions. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner previously said some ministries had been excessive with their request.\n\n\"There are individual departments that have submitted exorbitant wish lists \u2014 Christmas, Easter and birthdays combined, so to speak,\" Lindner said in May, according to Reuters. \"That is not acceptable.\"\n\nTensions were stoked after a late-2023 constitutional court decision blew a 60-billion-euro ($64.8 billion) funding gap in the government's budgetary plans for the years ahead.\n\nThe government had been planning to re-allocate unused debt that was originally taken on as emergency funding during the Covid-19 pandemic to its ongoing spending plans.\n\nThe court ruling stopped this and threw the government into a budget crisis that prompted discussions about the country's debt brake, which restricts how much debt the federal government can take on and caps the maximum size of its structural deficit.\n\nDiscussions around the merit of the debt brake, which has been a cornerstone of German fiscal policy since 2009, have also re-emerged as part of the discussions about the budget.",

    "body": "Supporters wave the national flag of France during a campaign meeting of France's far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party's President and lead European Parliament election candidate Jordan Bardella and President of the French far-right Rassemblement National (RN) parliamentary group Marine Le Pen, ahead of the upcoming European Union (EU) parliamentary elections, in Henin-Beaumont, northern France, on May 24, 2024. Francois Lo Presti | Afp | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 A somewhat strange and ironic political shift has gripped Europe over the last few years. In the formerly Brexiting, euroskeptic U.K., the pendulum has just swung back to the center-left Labour Party, which comes to power after a mammoth election win, ending 14 years of Conservative Party rule. A different picture is playing out in much of Western Europe \u2014 and in countries that disdained Brexit and the U.K.'s populist trend in recent years over the last decade or so. These states are now seeing their own electorates shift to the right, with nationalist, populist and euroskeptic parties riding high in voter polls and entering the corridors of power. While the U.K. and mainland Europe are heading in different directions politically, analysts say that the driving force behind changing patterns at the polls is fundamentally the same: voters are desperate for change. \"There's an anti-incumbency mood again in Europe,\" Dan Stevens, professor of politics at Exeter University, told CNBC. No matter who the incumbent is, Stevens said, \"there's just a general dissatisfaction and want for change.\" Tapping into the zeitgeist among British voters, the U.K.'s Labour Party used \"change\" as its rallying cry for voters ahead of Thursday's general election, which it won with a landslide.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe shift to the left comes after a tumultuous period in British politics during the last series of Conservative governments, with immigration concerns and euroskepticism culminating in the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union. More challenges followed throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine and a cost-of-living crisis. By the time the British election was called, Brits were just fed up, analysts said.\n\nShared concerns\n\nThe U.K. is not alone in looking for a political change of scenery. A similar shift has been observed in much of Western and Eastern Europe in recent years, with hard-right populist and nationalist parties upsetting and unseating the old political establishment. Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and France have all seen far-right parties \u2014 such as Fratelli d'Italia, the Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany or National Rally \u2014 rise up in opinion polls or win elections.\n\nwatch now\n\nSuch parties often emerged as protest factions, standing on an anti-immigration or euroskeptic platform, but they've since taken a more mainstream approach to attract a wider section of the electorate, who are concerned over broader universal issues such as jobs, education, health care, national identity and the economy. The latter issue is a particular driver of voting change, with rising food and energy costs and declining disposable household incomes having the most direct and decisive impact on voters. \"If you have very poor economic performance, then you would expect the political pendulum to swing, and when it swings it, it goes to the other side from where it is at present. ... It is swinging because people are hard up and aggravated. It's as simple as that,\" Christopher Granville, managing director of EMEA and global politics at TS Lombard, told CNBC, signaling that the turn of tide has not favored incumbent leaderships. \"Of course, there's a huge debate about the extent to which the respective governments are responsible for this poor economic performance. ... You can argue that they've been disastrously incompetent or you can argue that they've been innocent victims of external shocks, such as the energy crisis provoked by the war in Ukraine, the cost of living crisis etc,\" Granville added. \"Wherever you stand on that debate, the reality is the same, that the voters wants to swing the pendulum.\"\n\nProtest vote\n\nMany political experts pin the rise of the hard right in Europe on voters wanting to protest against the political status quo and its often long-standing establishment figures and parties. \"Right wing and hard-right parties are not only winning because of immigration, yes, that's their signature topic but they have been able to win because they attract a coalition of voters voting for them for different reasons,\" Sofia Vasilopoulou, professor of European politics at King's College London, told CNBC. \"They have a number of groups who are what I call 'peripheral' voters who tend to vote with them because of a lack of trust in politics, lack of trust in institutions, fatigue with the status quo,\" she said. \"It's a kind of a protest against politics in general, and there's quite a lot of voters that they get because of that.\" Political analysts point out that, although far-right political parties in France, Germany and Italy made gains in the recent European Parliament elections, they also did not perform quite as well as expected.\n\nwatch now",

    "body": "This photo taken on May 2, 2024 shows a general view of the entrance to the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) headquarters building in the Nihonbashi area of Tokyo. Richard A. Brooks | Afp | Getty Images\n\nJapanese stocks have been on a stellar run in 2024. In February, the country's benchmark Nikkei 225 smashed through its 1989 high. This week, the Nikkei and the broad-based Topix surpassed previous records to hit fresh all-time closing highs on Thursday. The Topix notably breached a 34-year record set in December 1989. How did the markets reach these level, especially for the Nikkei, which has scaled new peaks for the second time this year? Earnings are the single driver to the current market rally, Jesper Koll, expert director at Tokyo-based financial services company Monex Group, told CNBC.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon\n\n\"Corporate Japan is now benefitting from decades of operational restructuring,\" Koll said, adding that \"breakeven points are at world record lows, so even minimal increases in top-line revenues feed explosive profit growth.\" He predicted earnings growth of 35% over the next two financial years \u2014 from April 2024 to March 2026 \u2014 as well as topline growth of 4% per year. His forecasts stem from a prediction that Japanese companies will see domestic and global sales growth, and he explained that his prediction of a 4% sales growth is due to the wage hikes announced by Japan's largest union on Thursday.\n\nwatch now\n\nJapan's largest union, commonly referred to as Rengo, announced that Japanese companies have delivered the largest wage hikes in 33 this year. Monthly pay for union-backed workers will climb 5.1% on average this fiscal year ending March 2025. Rengo also said big firms with 300 or more union-backed employees raised wages by 5.19%, while smaller firms increased pay by 4.45%. \"You do not have a shunto [wage hike] of 5% and nominal sales rising less than 4%, for example,\" he points out. More importantly, Koll said, Japan is a \"bastion of stability.\" He pointed out that its monetary, fiscal and regulatory policies are stable and pro-growth, and this acts as an important support for financial markets. When the Nikkei crossed the 40,000 mark in March, Koll told CNBC at that time that it was \"perfectly reasonable\" for the index to cross 55,000 points by the end of 2025. Koll told CNBC this week: \"I stand by my forecast \u2014 the Nikkei 225 is poised to climb to 55,000 before the end of next year.\" If his prediction comes true, it would be a 37% upside from the 40,000 mark. Previously, Koll had predicted that the Nikkei would cross 40,000 in the twelve months from July 2023. He was later proven right when the index reached that level within eight months.\n\nHow sustainable is the rally?\n\nHowever, the million dollar question will be: how long can this rally last? A note by Nomura, published Thursday, said the gains on the Nikkei and Topix do not look appear sustainable. The analysts identified that these have caused by a short covering in futures. There's a caveat though. They said \"these hasty gains could turn out to be sustained if it starts to look likely that April\u2013June corporate earnings will surprise to the upside or that the Japanese equity market will see more inflows of longer-term money.\"\n\nwatch now",

South Korea's Kospi jumped 1.24% as Samsung Electronics stated second-quarter operating profit will surge almost 15-fold, mainly due to rebounding semiconductor prices driven by the artificial intelligence boom. Samsung shares climbed 2.84%, hitting their highest level since January 2021. Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 1% and mainland China's CSI 300 fell 0.48%.\n\nShort losses\n\nTesla's strong delivery report has caused significant losses for short sellers, with the stock rallying 17% in two days and short sellers losing $3.5 billion, according to S3 Partners. Tesla shares have surged 73% since April, nearing recovery with the stock $2 shy of wiping out losses for the year. Short interest is at 3.5% of the float, or 97 million shares, valued at $22.4 billion.\n\nFriday's 'slowing payroll'\n\nThe June nonfarm payrolls report takes on added significance amid signs of a slowing labor market. Payroll gains in 2024 have slowed compared to last year, with economists predicting growth of 200,000 jobs for June, down from May's 272,000. While job gains remain historically solid, rising unemployment levels and broader economic uncertainty have raised concerns about future economic weakness.\n\nSaks deal\n\nSaks Fifth Avenue parent HBC will acquire Neiman Marcus Group in a $2.65 billion deal, creating a new luxury retail giant. The combined entity will include Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks OFF 5TH, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. The move comes amid a challenging period for traditional brick-and-mortar retail, with department stores struggling to attract younger shoppers and facing a pullback in discretionary spending.\n\n[PRO] Evercore's 'best ideas'\n\nAfter a strong first-half performance for equities, fueled by the AI boom, Evercore ISI maintains its top stock picks for the second half of 2024.

The study will likely lead to a larger, more reliable one.\n\nDoctors view Ozempic and Wegovy, as well as similar drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, as game changers. Studies show these drugs can help users lose an average of between five and twenty percent of their body weight, even if patients have tried unsuccessfully to lose weight in the past.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***\n\nAll four drugs target the body's hormones to increase the feeling of fullness, decrease hunger, and slow the gastrointestinal (G.I.) tract. They're FDA-approved to treat Type-2 diabetes, obesity, or both. The company Novo Nordisk makes Ozempic and Wegovy, which contain the active ingredient semaglutide, which targets one hormone.\n\nThe drug company Eli Lilly manufactures Mounjaro and Zepbound, which contain the active ingredient tirzepatide, which targets two hormones. Research suggests Mounjaro and Zepbound lead to slightly more dramatic weight loss.\n\nAll four drugs are administered through weekly injections in the abdomen by the patients themselves. Many users pay over $1,000 a month out of pocket for the treatments. Despite the cost, high demand is leading to shortages of the medications.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is there's a lot of factors that go into the conditions of obesity and overweight. It's a complex, chronic condition. It's not as simple as eating less and moving more. So they do have a major role,\" obesity medicine expert Dr. Jen Ashton told ABC News, \"But insurance does not oftentimes cover them, they're incredibly expensive, and they have to be managed by someone who's familiar with this class of medications.\"\n\nLike all medications, these carry some possible side effects. The most common ones are nausea, constipation, and abdominal pain.\n\nResearch shows Ozempic and Wegovy lower the risk of death from heart attack or stroke by 20 percent after three years.\n\nDr. Daniel Skovronsy, president of Eli Lilly research labs, said his company is encouraging insurance companies and employers to cover the medications so more customers can avoid paying out of pocket for them.

    "title": "End Times and Israel: 'God's Covenant With the Jewish People' and Evangelical Support Amid Gaza War",
    "body": "Evangelical support for Israel has remained unchanged amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to a recent survey. Researchers found the belief that \u201cGod\u2019s covenant with the Jewish people remains intact today\u201d serves as the greatest impact on support for the Jewish state.\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cQuick Start\u201d:\n\n\u201cIf a respondent professes this belief, the likelihood that this person strongly supports Israel increases almost threefold (180%),\u201d reads a press release from researchers behind the study.\n\nDr. Motti Inbari, a professor of Jewish studies at UNC Pembroke, and Dr. Kirill Bumin, associate dean of Metropolitan College and director of Boston University Summer Term Programs, explained to CBN News what they found most stunning about the latest data.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this research for quite some time,\u201d Bumin said. \u201cAnd one of the things that I find particularly interesting is the degree to which the attitudes that we see in the Christian community are crystallized or rigid.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe have seen relatively little change in attitudes towards support for Israel, support for Palestinians, or support for neither from 2021 onward.\u201d\n\nBumin said this persists even after the Oct. 7 attack and subsequent war broke out.\n\nAnother factor of interest was generational differences the researchers observed among young evangelicals, who have been found to be less supportive \u2014 particularly those under the age of 20 \u2014 of Israel.\n\n\u201c[This is the case] even after we take into account their religious attendance, their specific religious beliefs, political beliefs, socialization in pro-Israel circles,\u201d Bumin said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something very distinct about the under-30 crowd, especially in comparison to the 50 to 64-year-old respondents who are even more supportive of Israel than the 65-plus crowd.\u201d\n\nInbari said the younger generation has more access to information on social media and other platforms \u2014 tools older generations aren\u2019t as accustomed to. He said these platforms, by design, create an echo chamber dynamic as people are primarily served only the content they want to see and hear.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in \u2026 your own mindset [and] you\u2019re not exposed to other views,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this creates a lot of polarization also as a result. \u2026 Another aspect is that it\u2019s very visual. You can see things that, back when I was younger, in that age, when I was opening the newspaper, I was reading. Now, they see. They don\u2019t read; they see. It creates a different effect.\u201d\n\nAs for evangelical support more generally, Bumin said an embrace of the biblical narrative, particularly the Abrahamic covenant, is \u201cexceptionally important\u201d to explain why evangelicals have such a positive view of Israel.\n\n\u201cSupport for Abrahamic covenant \u2014 this notion that God\u2019s covenant with the Jewish people is intact and eternal and that, as a result of Gentiles supporting Abrahamic covenant, that there are blessings for the Gentiles to be had \u2026 that aspect has repeatedly received support, not only in the evangelical community, but indeed across all Christian denominations \u2026 that we have studied,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, in our 2024 survey, that is the No. 1 most impactful variable that we\u2019ve considered in terms of relative impact on people\u2019s attitudes \u2026 in terms of support for Israel.\u201d\n\nThe theological elements don\u2019t end there, though, as Bumin also cited evangelicals\u2019 views on the end times, particularly premillennialism. According to GotQuestions.org, premillennialism is the \u201cview that Christ\u2019s second coming will occur prior to His millennial kingdom, and that the millennial kingdom is a literal 1,000-year reign of Christ on earth.\u201d\n\nBumin said premillennialism offers a \u201cvery clear-cut picture\u201d of the role of the Jewish people and Israel in the end of days, with Jerusalem taking center stage. This theological construct, he said, helps consistently affirm support for Israel, especially in this context.\n\n\u201cWe also find for evangelicals again and again that ascribing to a particular theology or theological view related to end times known as premillennialism has been really important,\u201d Bumin continued. \u201cThere are a lot of different elements to these millennial views. There\u2019s a premillennialism, post-millennialism, amillennialism, but the most important aspect in terms of these views for us is the relationship to the Jewish people and Israel in the end times.\u201d\n\nInbari noted that younger evangelicals are much less inclined to take a premillennial view, showcasing how this might impact the aforementioned decreased support they show for the Jewish state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another way to explain why young evangelicals are drifting away from supporting Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the eschatological view that is part of that mix as well.\u201d\n\nInbari and Bumin also spoke about the current war in Gaza and its relation to views on Israel and Palestine.

    "title": "How Liberty Flowed From Ancient Israel to the New America",
    "body": "How Liberty Flowed From Ancient Israel to the New America\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. & JERUSALEM \u2014 The idea that liberty should reign in America didn't start with the Declaration of Independence or the 4th of July, 1776. The seeds were planted more than a hundred years before in the soil of the New World. One of the most important was in what would become Connecticut.\n\nA vast wilderness awaited the hundred, hardy Christians who left Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1636 with the Rev. Thomas Hooker to settle what is now Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nIn such a wild land, they asked the popular pastor how they should govern it. What Rev. Hooker preached on May 31st, 1638 was so profound it \"sowed the seeds of free Constitutional government in America.\" That's what it says at the base of a statue of Hooker that stands in Hartford to commemorate the man who helped form a free nation.\n\n'Free Consent of the People'\n\nThe key words in that sermon were '\"the foundation of authority is laid, firstly, in the free consent of the people.\"\n\nIn other words, not that a king or emperor should rule them, but the people themselves should be the rulers.\n\nHis pushing this idea is why some historians have labeled Hooker \"the father of American democracy.\"\n\nHooker's fellow pioneers ran with the idea of \"the free consent of the people,\" according to William Federer, author of the historical series \"American Minute,\" which can be found at www.AmericanMinute.com\n\n\n\n\"This was revolutionary and it turned into the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut which is considered the first written constitution in modern times,\" Federer told CBN News.\n\nThis insistence on the people having \"free consent\" is a part of what drove Hooker and his fellow settlers to get out of the Puritan Cambridge.\n\nRadio talk show host Michael Medved explained, \"It's precisely what led Thomas Hooker to found Connecticut. To leave Massachusetts. He was having an argument with other pastors. He didn't see it the way they did. It's John Cotton versus Thomas Hooker. And part of what it has to do with is suffrage, is the ability of people to vote and to make their own decisions.\"\n\nThere's another statue in Hartford of a pioneer family with their heads bowed, the father kneeling, in prayer. A plaque behind them says \"here they established the form of government upon which the present U.S. Constitution is modeled.\"\n\n\"Which starts off how?\" Federer asked. He answered: \"'We the People.'\"\n\nRadical Idea in a World of Kings & Potentates\n\nThe historian pointed out how radical this was after 6,000 years of almost nothing but rule by kings and emperors, pharaohs, and potentates.\n\n\"And they believed in a top-down form of government, where God gives all the power and the rights to the king and he's God's lieutenant who dispenses it to the people,\" Federer said.\n\nColonialists like Hooker turned that on its head.\n\nFederer \u2013 who authored Who is the King in America? -- explained, \"America's founders when they got the chance, they wanted to run away from a king, and they flipped it and made the people the king.\"\n\nMedved summed up their bedrock belief: \"All of us have the same ultimate Sovereign, God Almighty. But that God Almighty does not appoint and designate crowned heads over us. The power comes from the people.\"\n\nFederer recalled, \"John Jay, the first Chief Justice, said 'the people are the sovereign of this country.'\"\n\nAnd they practice that sovereignty as they all head to the polls to pick their representatives in government.\n\nHooker is just one of many preachers who pushed the colonies toward liberty and rule by the people. Many historians suggest in their earliest days, preachers were often the most influential thought leaders in the colonies.\n\nFearing 'Establishment of Religion'\n\nIn fact, religion was such a powerful force that most colonies named the most powerful denomination in a particular colony the official church there. That's \"establishment of religion.\"\n\n\"All of these colonies were deeply religious. All of them. And all of them deeply Christian,\" Medved said. \"But they were Christian in distinctive ways. And the different Christian denominations, then as now, distrusted each other. The Puritans in Massachusetts and Connecticut did not like the Anglicans in North Carolina and Virginia. And then you had Quakers who nobody liked who were in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nMedved explained as the colonies were forming the newly independent nation of America, they were concerned about how this establishment of religion could actually dampen some of that freedom.\n\nFor instance, Medved pointed out, \"Virginia was the most powerful colony. It was the most populous and the most powerful. And people were very afraid that Virginia would use that power to establish the Anglican Church.\"\n\nThey didn't want to go from being ruled over by a king they didn't respect to being dictated to by a denomination they didn't even belong to.\n\nAs Federer put it, \"They didn't want a federal Walmart to come into town and put out of business their local mom-and-pop denomination.\"\n\nMedved asked, \"What do you do when you have these different states, different requirements, different religions? You make a First Amendment which says 'Congress shall make no law respecting establishment of religion.'\"\n\nHe argued, though, that in no way suggested they wanted to be free of religion or God. In fact, they openly praised Him and gave Him credit for His hand in they're becoming a free nation.\n\nAmerican Experiment = American Miracle\n\n\"The one idea that seemed to unite all the founders was the idea of Providence,\" Medved stated, \"The idea that they were doing God's work; that this American experiment was ultimately an American miracle.\"\n\nWhich just happens to be the name of Medved's new book: The American Miracle: Divine Providence in the Rise of the Republic.\n\nStill, all these preachers and founding fathers did have a model for another time when God freed a people from rule by an all-powerful potentate and showed them the concept of liberty and how to rule themselves, guided by His hand.\n\n\"When Moses took the children of Israel out of Egypt, that was the first instance in world history of an entire nation with no king,\" Federer pointed out.\n\nHebrew Republic Inspired Them\n\nPilgrims and Puritans crushed under European kings studied this ancient \"Hebrew republic\" and took the dream to emulate it with them as they fled to North America.\n\nOne thing after another was revolutionary in this Hebrew Republic, such as the tribes electing their own leaders. And that all people were to be treated as equals.\n\n\"Israel was the beginning of the concept of equality on planet Earth,\" Federer said.\n\nIt was also the first nation where everyone was taught to read, so they all could be taught the law. And each had a hand in enforcing it and maintaining it, along with the nation itself. So they didn't need a standing army, which in many nations becomes a tool in the hands of a power-hungry ruler.\n\n\"You have a king, he has an army to enforce his will,\" Federer explained. \"In Israel, every man was in the militia and armed and ready at a moment's notice to defend his family and his community.\"\n\nHe added, \"Israel had no police. Not only did everyone get taught the law, everyone was responsible to help enforce the law.\"\n\nFinding Freedom in the God of Liberty\n\nBut what was to keep all this freedom from spiraling down into anarchy?\n\nFederer explained, \"Ancient Israel had the key ingredient: a God who was watching everyone, He wants you to be fair, and He's going to hold you accountable in the future.\"\n\n\"If everybody in the country believes this, you can maintain complete order with no police. Maximum liberty!\" Federer declared.\n\nThe founding fathers believed fervently that God made mankind to be free and wanted them to have this sort of maximum liberty.\n\nFederer concluded, \"That allowed America to blossom into this amazing experiment of the people getting to be king. And each individual citizen accountable to God.\"\n\n*First published June 30, 2017",

    "title": "Families of Covenant School Victims Applaud Move to Keep Nashville Shooter's Manifesto Sealed",
    "body": "A Tennessee judge has ruled against releasing the journals written by the shooter who killed three 9-year-olds and three adults at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville in March of last year.\n\nParents of the victims asked the judge not to release the killer's manifesto.\n\nChancery Court Judge I\u2019Ashea Myles made the ruling on July 4, declaring that The Covenant School children and parents hold the copyright to any writings or other works created by shooter Audrey Hale, a former student and transgender who was killed by police. Hale's parents inherited the works and then transferred ownership to the families.\n\nMyles said \u201cthe original writings, journals, art, photos and videos created by Hale\u201d are subject to an exception to the Tennessee Public Records Act created by the federal Copyright Act.\n\nThe ruling comes more than a year after several groups filed public records requests for documents seized by Metro Nashville Police during their investigation into the March 2023 shooting, wanting to expose the motivation behind the attack.\n\nThe group of Covenant parents opposed to the writings being released were allowed to intervene in the case and argued that the records should never become public. They said the release would be traumatic for the families and could inspire copycat attacks.\n\nAs part of the effort to keep the records closed, Hale's parents transferred ownership of Hale's property to the parents' group. Attorneys for the parents then argued they owned the copyright, further reason the records could not be released.\n\nBrent Leatherwood, an attorney for families of the victims, and father of students who attend Covenant, shared reaction to the judge's ruling Friday morning.\n\nHere Are Their Responses:\n\nThe Family of Hallie Scruggs - \"Far too often in our time, cruelty prevails over kindness; evil prevails over justice. Today was not one of those days. Instead, our hope is that the pain and suffering we have endured over the last year won't continue forward to terrorize other families and other communities. Though we still grieve, we are thankful for this result.\"\n\nThe Family of Mike Hill - \"Our dad found such joy each day at school with those children. He loved serving them and he was always there to protect them. While we still feel the pain of his loss in our lives, this decision helps continue his legacy as our family, Covenant children, and other communities will be more protected because these ramblings will not be able to inspire future attacks from other individuals who are consumed by hate and perceived grievances.\"\n\nThe Family of Cindy Peak - \"The last year and a half without Cindy has been difficult. But today brings a measure of relief in our family. Denying the shooter some of the notoriety she sought by releasing her vile and unfiltered thoughts on the world is a result everyone should be thankful for. I only wish that others, whether seeking clicks or profit, had felt that way before revealing the depth of depravity that existed in the mind of a mass murderer on March 27.\"\n\nDr. Erin Kinney, Mother of Will Kinney - \"This opinion is an important first step to making sure the killer can't hurt our babies anymore. The importance is even more clear due to the leaking of stolen police documents, which has violated our parental right to protect our traumatized and grieving children from material that could destroy their lives. We are more resolved than ever to fight to keep our children and everyone's children safe from this murderer.\"\n\nThe Family of Katherine Koonce - \"The Court's finding vindicates our family's desire that public focus should be on the nobility of the loved ones who died tragically, and on the gracious support extended to households who suffered loss and trauma.\"\n\nThe Family of Evelyn Dieckhaus - \"No result will lessen the pain we carry each day. But this decision will ensure no additional burden is added to our family, and that has been a major objective for us. No one should have to live through the nightmare of losing a child to such senseless acts, and our hope is that by keeping the rest of this material from seeing the light of day, it will ensure no other family has to walk this path.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Hurricane Beryl Strikes Mexico\u2019s Coast as a Cat 2 Storm, Could Reemerge to Hit Texas",
    "body": "TULUM, Mexico (AP) - Hurricane Beryl made landfall on Mexico\u2019s coast near the resort of Tulum as a Category 2 storm early Friday, whipping trees and knocking out power as it came ashore after leaving a trail of destruction across the eastern Caribbean.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said that Beryl is expected to rapidly weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses over the Yucatan Peninsula before it re-emerges into the Gulf of Mexico and likely regains hurricane strength.\n\nOnce in the warm waters of the Gulf, Beryl is forecast to head toward northern Mexico near the Texas border, an area had already been soaked by Tropical Storm Alberto just a couple of weeks ago.\n\nOnce the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl spread destruction in Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Barbados in recent days.\n\nShortly after landfall, Beryl\u2019s maximum windspeeds had decreased to 100 mph (160 kph), according to the U.S. Hurricane Center.\n\nMexican authorities had moved some tourists and residents out, of low-lying areas around the Yucatan peninsula prior to landfall, but tens of thousands remained to tough out the 100 mph (160 kph) winds and expected storm surge. Much of the area around Tulum is just a few yards (meters) above sea level.\n\nThe city was plunged into darkness when the storm knocked out power as it came ashore. Screeching winds set off car alarms across the town.\n\nOnce a sleepy, laid-back village, in recent years Tulum has boomed with unrestrained development and now has about 50,000 permanent inhabitants and at least as many tourists on an average day. The resort now has its own international airport.\n\nEarly Friday, the storm\u2019s center was about 15 miles (25 kilometers) north-northwest of Tulum and was moving west-northwest at 15 mph (about 24 kph), the hurricane center said.\n\nOn Friday, Beryl was expected to weaken as it crossed over the Yucatan peninsula and re-emerge in the Gulf of Mexico, where the surprisingly resilient storm could once again become a hurricane and make a second landfall around Mexico's border with Texas next week.\n\nAuthorities around the Yucatan peninsula have prepared shelters, evacuated some small outlying coastal communities and even moved sea turtle eggs off beaches threatened by storm surge. In Tulum, authorities shut things down and evacuated beachside hotels.\n\nTourists were also taking precautions. Lara Marsters, 54, a therapist visiting Tulum from Boise, Idaho, said \u201cthis morning we woke up and just filled all of our empty water bottles with water from the tap and put it in the freezer \u2026 so we will have water to flush the toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect that the power will go out,\u201d Marsters said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hunker down and stay safe.\u201d\n\nBut once Beryl re-emerges into the Gulf of Mexico a day later, forecasters say it is again expected to build to hurricane strength and could hit right around the Mexico-U.S. border, at Matamoros. That area was already soaked in June by Tropical Storm Alberto.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez said temporary storm shelters were in place at schools and hotels but efforts to evacuate a few highly exposed villages - like Punta Allen, which sits on a narrow spit of land south of Tulum - and Mahahual, further south - had been only partially successful.\n\nEarlier, Beryl wreaked havoc in the Caribbean. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 95% of homes on a pair of islands in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, jumbled fishing boats in Barbados and ripped off roofs and knocked out electricity in Jamaica.\n\nOn Union Island, part of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a man who identified himself as Captain Baga described the storm's impact, including how he had filled two 2,000-gallon rubber water tanks in preparation.\n\n\u201cI strapped them down securely on six sides; and I watched the wind lift those tanks and take them away -- filled with water,\" he said Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m a sailor and I never believed wind could do what I saw it do, if anyone (had) ever told me wind could do that, I would have told them they lie!\u201d\n\nThe island was littered with debris from homes that looked like they had exploded.\n\nGirlyn Williams and Jeremiah Forde were trying to recover what they could Thursday around their home, where only a concrete foundation remained standing.\n\nThey had run from room to room during the storm as different sections of their house were being destroyed. Eventually, they hid in a small space created by a rubber water tank that got wedged between the house and a concrete tank. Williams cut her leg in the scramble and needed six stitches.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Three other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where four people were missing, officials said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.\n\n",

    "body": "The Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah launched a massive barrage of nearly 200 rockets, missiles, and drones on Thursday at northern Israel, including the Golan Heights and close to the Sea of Galilee.\n\nHezbollah claimed it was in retaliation for Israel\u2019s assassination of Mohammed Khaasab, whom they gave the title of honorary commander. Though he was killed in Lebanon, Hezbollah said he was martyred on the \u201croad to Jerusalem,\u201d a signal that the group\u2019s ultimate goal is to conquer Jerusalem.\n\n\"The series of responses is ongoing and will continue, targeting new sites the enemy never imagined would be hit,\" said the head of Hezbollah\u2019s Executive Council, Hashem Safieddine.\n\nThe ongoing assault could lead Israel to launch an all-out war on Hezbollah to enable 80,000 evacuated Israelis back into their homes in the north.\n\n\"We know there is still a long way to go, but we are determined to restore security to the north and return the residents safely to their homes,\u201d stated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nHezbollah Threatening More Attacks\n\nAs war inches closer, both Hezbollah and its patron Iran are threatening to obliterate Israel. Netanyahu issued a strong response, \u201cWe established a principle, whoever harms us is marked for death. We put it into practice.\"\n\nHamas has made some amendments to a proposed ceasefire deal that could free many of the hostages now captive in Gaza. The changes were enough for Israel to send a negotiating team to renewed ceasefire talks, but there are conflicting reports on whether Hamas is ready to agree to a deal without a permanent end to the fighting and the removal of all Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nThose are both dealbreakers according to Netanyahu.\n\nNYT Claims Some IDF Generals Ready to Give Up in Gaza\n\nAccording to a New York Times report that cited unnamed sources, some top IDF generals are ready to give up the war on Hamas if it means the hostages will finally be set free.\n\nNetanyahu is blasting the report, \u201cI don\u2019t know who those unnamed parties are, but I\u2019m here to make it unequivocally clear: it won\u2019t happen.\"\n\nNetanyahu reiterated his government\u2019s war goals are to return all the hostages, eliminate Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, and ensure that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel.\n\nAs for the ongoing conflict in Gaza, one of Israel's most powerful enemies, Turkey, says the Jewish nation must be forced to end the war that has laid waste to much of Gaza.\n\nHezbollah, Iran & Israel Trade Death Threats\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, \"To end this destruction (in Gaza) Israel must be stopped and forced to accept a permanent ceasefire.\"\n\nTo that end, several Arab nations are seeking to isolate Israel by moving to freeze its participation in the United Nations.\n\nThe Palestinian Permanent Representative to the Arab League, Muhannad al-Aklouk stated, \"A step like this step is what ended, brought down, and eliminated the colonial regime in South Africa.\"\n\nOn July 4th, Netanyahu sent Independence Day greetings and a message to the U.S.:\n\n\"At their base, Israel and America are guided by the same twin insights. Freedom is the most precious gift humanity will ever know, and freedom isn't free. You have to be willing to fight for it.\"",
    "summary": "Hezbollah claimed it was in retaliation for Israel\u2019s assassination of Mohammed Khaasab, whom they gave the title of honorary commander.\nThe ongoing assault could lead Israel to launch an all-out war on Hezbollah to enable 80,000 evacuated Israelis back into their homes in the north.\nHezbollah Threatening More AttacksAs war inches closer, both Hezbollah and its patron Iran are threatening to obliterate Israel.\nNetanyahu issued a strong response, \u201cWe established a principle, whoever harms us is marked for death.\nHezbollah, Iran & Israel Trade Death ThreatsTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, \"To end this destruction (in Gaza) Israel must be stopped and forced to accept a permanent ceasefire.\"",

    "body": "President William Ruto has announced a Sh177 billion spending cuts and Sh169 billion in additional borrowing to plug the budget hole left after the withdrawal of the Finance Bill, 2024.\n\nPresident Ruto, in a live address from State House, said the government would present a proposal to the National Assembly to approve the expenditure cuts after the withdrawal of the Bill intended to raise Sh346 billion in new taxes.\n\nThis, the President said, would ensure funding of key budget lines, including the hiring of 46,000 Junior Secondary School teachers on a permanent and pensionable basis, recruitment of medical interns, provision of money to buy milk from farmers at Sh50 per litre, and the retention of the fertiliser subsidy.\n\nOthers are the funding to complete stalled road projects, payment of coffee debt and the proposed Coffee Cherry Fund, public-owned sugar firms to pay debts to farmers, new varsity funding and arrears owed to counties, the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NGCDF) and pension.\n\nOverlapping mandates\n\nThe measures will also include the dissolution of 47 State corporations with overlapping mandates, the end of harambees (fundraising) for all State officers, and the removal of confidential budgets in all offices, including his own.\n\nThese were among the raft of measures announced by Dr Ruto at State House, Nairobi following youth-led protests against increased tax measures, which saw the rare climb-down to drop the Finance Bill, 2024, which was rejected by most Kenyans as punitive.\n\nOn harambees, President Ruto said Attorney General Justin Muturi had been tasked to prepare a law to effect the ban on all State officers participating in such. The law, he said, would also include regulations on philanthropic activities.\n\nAt the same time, the President announced the end of funding to the offices of the First Lady and those of the spouses of the Deputy President and the Prime Cabinet Secretary.\n\nThe President also suspended the filling of the offices of the Chief Administrative Secretary, for which he had proposed 50 people but their appointment was blocked by the courts.\n\nParliament has since passed a new law allowing their appointments, which will now cease following the head of State\u2019s pronouncement.\n\nPresident Ruto also suspended the purchase of motor vehicles for all government agencies and departments for one year, except for the security teams.\n\nDebt forensic audit\n\nThe Head of State suspended all non-essential travel for all civil servants and reduced the budget for government buildings renovations by 50 percent.\n\nHe also announced the reduction of advisors in government, recently budgeted to gobble up Sh1.1 billion in their budgets for those only advising the President.\n\nPresident Ruto also announced that all public servants would retire at the age of 60, \u201cwith no exceptions whatsoever.\u201d\n\nOn public debt, President Ruto announced the formation of an independent taskforce to conduct a forensic audit of the debt.\n\nThe team is to report in three months and is to clarify on the extent and nature of Kenya\u2019s debt, as well as recommend proposals to manage the skyrocketing debt.\n\nX space\n\nFollowing the speech, Ruto hosted a live audio forum on X meant to engage with young people. He faced sharp questioning about policy brutality, corruption and economic policy.\n\nOne activist involved in the protests, Osama Otero, questioned Ruto about alleged abductions of protesters by state security agents, saying he had been taken at 3 am by men in plain clothes, blindfolded and taken to a house to be questioned.\n\n\"Mr President, are we in a terrorist country?\" Otero asked.\n\nRuto, who had previously denied police involvement in dozens of reported disappearances, apologised for the treatment Otero had suffered and promised to take action on his case.\n\nProtests have continued since Ruto scrapped the finance bill, with many demonstrators calling for the president to resign. But turnout has been down and some activists have called for a rethink of their strategy after Tuesday's demonstrations were marred by violence and looting.\n\nActivists have blamed the violence on thugs hired by politicians to discredit the protest movement. The government has said that opportunistic criminals are responsible.\n\nHere is a summary of new proposed austerity measures:\n\n47 State corporations with overlapping functions to be dissolved. Staff in affected agencies to be transferred to ministries and agencies.\n\nChief Administrative Secretaries (CAS) office suspended.\n\nPresidential advisors reduced by 50 percent with immediate effect.\n\nBudget for First Lady and spouses of Deputy President, and the Prime Cabinet Secretary removed.\n\nConfidential budget in State House, all offices removed.\n\nRenovations reduced by 50 percent.\n\nNo extension past 60-year retirement for all civil servants.\n\nPurchase of vehicles suspended for 12 months, except for security agencies.\n\nAll non-essential travel suspended.\n\nNo state officer, public servants will participate in harambees. Attorney General to submit law to this effect on harambee, philanthropic and charitable ventures.\n\nChanges in government to be announced soon.",

    "body": "Keir Starmer will be Britain's next prime minister with his centre left Labour Party expected to win a huge majority in a parliamentary election, ending 14 years of often tumultuous Conservative government by trouncing Rishi Sunak's party.\n\nWith many results still to be announced from Thursday's vote, centre-left Labour has already won more than 326 of the 650 seats in parliament, with an exit poll suggesting it would capture about 410.\n\nOn a humiliating night for Sunak, the Conservatives have so far only won 70 and were predicted to suffer the worst performance in the party's long history with voters punishing them for a cost of living crisis, failing public services, and a series of scandals.\n\n\"Tonight, people here and around the country have spoken and they're ready for change, to end the politics of performance, a return to politics as public service,\" Starmer said after winning his seat in London.\n\n\"The change begins right here ... You have voted. It is now time for us to deliver.\"\n\nKeir Starmer, leader of Britain's Labour Party and his wife Victoria Starmer attend a reception to celebrate Starmer's win in the election, at Tate Modern, in London, Britain, July 5, 2024. Photo credit: Reuters\n\nSunak conceded defeat and said he had called Starmer to congratulate him on his victory.\n\n\"Today power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner, with goodwill on all sides,\" he said after regaining his seat. \"There is much to learn and reflect on and I take responsibility for the loss to the many good hardworking Conservative candidates ... I am sorry.\"\n\nDespite his convincing victory, polls have suggested there is little enthusiasm for Starmer or his party, and he comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges.\n\nBritain's tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after World War Two, net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output, living standards have fallen, and public services are creaking, especially the much cherished National Health Service which has been dogged by strikes.\n\nHe has already had to scale back some of Labour's more ambitious plans, such as its flagship green spending pledges, while he has promised not to raise taxes for \"working people\".\n\nMuch of the heavy damage to the Conservative support was inflicted by the right-wing populist Reform UK party, headed by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, who had campaigned strongly on curbing immigration.\n\nStarmer has promised to scrap the Conservative's controversial policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, but will be under pressure himself to find a solution to stopping tens of thousands of people arriving across the Channel on small boats.\n\nWithin the Conservative party, the recriminations and debate over its future direction immediately began, with some saying its failure stemmed from abandoning the centre ground while others argued Reform had won over voters who felt the party had deserted its roots.\n\nReform captured four seats, with Farage himself finally being elected to parliament at his eighth attempt, and won more votes than the Conservatives across swathes of the country.\n\n\"There is a massive gap on the centre right of British politics and my job is to fill it, and that's exactly what I'm going to do,\" a triumphant Farage said. \"Believe me, folks, this is just the first step of something that is going to stun all of you.\"\n\nKeir Starmer, leader of Britain's Labour Party and his wife Victoria Starmer greet supporters as they attend a reception to celebrate Starmer's win in the election, at Tate Modern, in London, Britain, July 5, 2024. Photo credit: Reuters\n\nThe rise in support for a populist alternative echoed recent similar results in Europe, where the far right have been surging.\n\nBut, unlike France where Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party made historic gains in an election last Sunday, overall the British public has plumped for a centre-left party to bring about change.\n\nStarmer has promised to improve relations with the European Union to resolve issues created by Brexit, just as far-right politicians are enjoying success. However, despite opposing Brexit, rejoining the European Union is not on the table.\n\nHe may also have to work with Donald Trump in the United States if he wins November's presidential election, but he has vowed to continue London's unequivocal support for Ukraine.\n\nThe election victory would represent an incredible turnaround for Starmer and Labour, which critics and supporters said was facing an existential crisis just three years ago when it appeared to have lost its way after its 2019 drubbing.\n\nBut a series of Conservative scandals - most notably revelations of parties in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns - undermined then prime minister Boris Johnson and its commanding poll leads evaporated.\n\nLiz Truss' disastrous six-week premiership, which followed Johnson being forced out at the end of 2022, cemented the decline, and Sunak was unable to make any dent in Labour's now commanding poll lead.\n\nSunak stunned Westminster and many in his own party by calling the election earlier than he needed to in May with the Conservatives trailing Labour by some 20 points in opinion polls, and his campaign then proved a disaster.\n\n\"We deserved to lose. The Conservative Party just appears exhausted and out of ideas,\" Ed Costello, the chairman of the Grassroots Conservatives organisation, which represents rank-and-file members, told Reuters.",

    "title": "George Odenyo: the CEO with nothing on his desk",
    "body": "If you broke into George Odenyo\u2019s office at Delta Corner Annex you would face two puzzling scenarios. One, you wouldn\u2019t be able to nick anything, and two, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to know what he does for a living. This is because his office is bare.\n\nThere is a table with a computer. No papers. No trays, no photos of his family. No trophies. There is a lonesome coat hanger and a small glass plaque that his children gifted him for Father\u2019s Day. It brings to mind that quote by Ram Dass: \u201cEmptiness is not really empty, emptiness is full of everything. The \u2018everything\u2019 just isn\u2019t manifest.\u201d Or he might just be a minimalist.\n\nOdenyo is the CEO of American Tower Company (ATC) Kenya Operations, a subsidiary of American Tower Corporation. It is an American real estate investment firm that owns, develops, and operates wireless and broadcast communication infrastructure - towers, telecom masts - in several countries. ATC owns about 4,000 towers across Kenya that host Telkom, Safaricom, Airtel, and other small telecom companies on a shared infrastructure platform.\n\nHis resume is as minimalist as his office; he\u2019s worked in two organisations, according to his LinkedIn profile. For 14 years he worked with MTN Business, leaving as Head of Finance. Then five years with Eaton Towers as Finance Director before the company was acquired by ATC.\n\nYour desk is so bare. Are you a minimalist or are you hardly in the office?\n\nI have the right team in the company so my desk doesn\u2019t have to look busy. Part of me is also opposed to holding onto things, I try to release them as soon as possible. If there's nothing I can do with it, I give it to the next person who can address it.\n\nWhat does it take to build one?\n\nFirst, our customer, the operator, has to identify where they want the tower, which is driven by need, often determined by the population. We will then acquire the site, and get the necessary permits from the National Environmental Management Authority, Kenya Civil Aviation, and county governments. Once we acquire the site we erect the tower and then power it with a grid.\n\nAs a numbers guy, how do you find transitioning to dealing with people?\n\nWell, I have appreciated that as a leader, you are as strong as your people. I have led teams in my previous roles so it\u2019s not entirely new. People can be difficult but the trick lies in figuring out how to understand them. Everybody is motivated by something; a dream or ambition and it\u2019s upon you to connect them with whatever it is. So my job is to find how their dreams connect with the company's dreams.\n\nAnd what's your dream?\n\nMake life better for me, my family, and my community. I seek to be impactful, and valuable; to change the world.\n\nDo you feel like you are doing that here at ATC, building towers?\n\nYes, I am. Our purpose is to build a more connected Africa. Towers connect people by enabling them to communicate well. Most misunderstandings come from people not being able to communicate.\n\nDid you always want to be in finance?\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t know about finance until later. When I was in high school my late father invited somebody to have a chat with me, a guy who had excelled in his high school and was then in university. The talk was not more than five minutes. He talked about CPA (Certified Public Accountant) a lot. He said it was something I could do as I waited to go to university. I was sold on the idea. I then eagerly waited for KCA to announce applications in the newspapers. I would bother the principal (St Marys Yala) for the newspaper every week to check if the call was out. That\u2019s how I came across Strathmore in the newspaper and applied and eventually enrolled.\n\nSo if this fellow was a doctor do you think you would have been influenced to study medicine?\n\nYes, definitely. However, in high school, I was good at electricity and my dream was to be an electrical engineer. But this guy came earlier before that could happen. [Chuckle]\n\nAmerica Tower Corporation Kenya CEO George Odenyo during the interview on June 24, 2024 at his office in Nairobi. Photo credit: Billy Ogada | Nation Media Group\n\nIs there a chance that you might still pursue that love?\n\nNo, I'm in that environment either way. I have so many engineers here. So I still enjoy what I do because of that. In hindsight, I think there's a reason why things happen the way they happen. I have no regrets.\n\nHave you had conversations with yourself about what your purpose is, and why you are here? Are you here to build masts?\n\nI think we are in this world to create an impact, to make a difference. I believe that helping others is integral to our purpose. I have benefited from the generosity of others in my entire journey, some of whom were not even my relatives. So I\u2019m also doing the same. It makes me happy to see others excel. My earlier years were instrumental in shaping who I have become.\n\nBy the time I was joining the University of Nairobi, I was already done with part two of my CPA which allowed me to get an internship that eventually turned into a job. Against the wishes of my parents and the advice of other people close to me, I decided to drop out of university. I completed my CPA later at Catholic University. I also did a Bachelor of Commerce at the same university. I have worked and learned, not the other way around.\n\nHow old are you?\n\nI\u2019m 45 now. I was born in Pumwani but my dad moved to the village when I was five or so years old. It's a place called Ugunja in Nyanza, you might know it. I struggled academically in my earlier years until around Class Six when I met a teacher who changed how I viewed academics and helped me excel. I\u2019m the only son in a family of three girls and that didn\u2019t help in those years when I was not performing well because my mom was on my case.\n\nWhat was the impact of growing up in a family of girls as the only boy?\n\nQuite interesting. You learn a lot about women without realising it. But also perhaps that made me more empathetic to women. I wasn\u2019t spared from chores because I was the only boy, in fact, sometimes I was made to do a little more. My dad believed in me. Unfortunately, he died when I was 25 years old.\n\nWho filled the role of a father for you after he died?\n\nWhen he died I became the 'father' in the family. My mom handed everything over to me. She died two years ago.\n\nDo you have children?\n\nI have three; an 18, a 17, and a 10-year-old. A boy and two girls. This is a plaque they gifted me for Father\u2019s Day.\n\nCan you believe you have a 18-year-old?\n\n[Laughs] Yes, I can. It's because I started so early. I started working at 21 and that changed my life because when money started coming in, my old man, to ensure I did not get lost, encouraged me to find a wife and settle down. So at 25 I was already married and I started a family immediately.\n\nWhat bits of fatherhood do you find very challenging?\n\nBecause I grew up in a different time it\u2019s challenging to appreciate the circumstances that our children are growing up in now. It\u2019s often difficult to relate to them and their situation. Everything is different and sometimes you want your child to see things your way but they can\u2019t. You have to accept that it is their life and love them. You cannot control their lives. But I try as much as possible to make sure that I pass the right baton to them.\n\nDo you think you're successful?\n\nAs a father?\n\nNo, as a man who lives and works.\n\nI don't talk about success. I talk about being valuable. Am I valuable? Yes, for sure. I believe that as long as you are valuable out here in the community, in society, and in the family, then success will follow you.\n\nHow do you know for certain that you're valuable?\n\nBecause of what you're able to give. You are valuable because of what you are giving at work, at home, and in your community. I believe that as long as you are growing, over time you become valuable. You become valuable by the knowledge that you can share and by the guidance you can give. And that way success can follow you in this season.\n\nWhat are some of the most difficult things you are experiencing in this season as a man?\n\nThings are moving so fast and I wonder if I will achieve everything I have set out to achieve. But other than that, I think it's a beautiful time to be alive, to be a father, to be a leader, to be living and doing things that need to be done.\n\nWhen your son gets to the age where he says, I found a wife. What are the top three pieces of advice you will give him?\n\nOne, I will let him know that this is his decision, not mine, not his mother's. It is his calling. So he has to take that responsibility single-handedly, of course with support.",

    "body": "The workplace is experiencing a historic transformation as more and more younger people whose lives revolve around the Internet of Things, mobile phones, and social media are hired.\n\nWith the latest breed of employees being outspoken, outgoing, and carefree, Gen Z is rewriting norms and daily practices that define a workplace.\n\nAway from the four-walled offices with a kitchen and boardroom, as well as individual offices for senior management, we now have a hybrid mode of working that allows people to work away from the office and for longer hours than older generations ever did.\n\nWith the Internet readily available everywhere, knowledge of labour rights has expanded, and we now interact more virtually than physically.\n\nSocial media sites are now considered official modes of communication. Not to mention the change of the official (office) dress code, the new \u2018normal\u2019 hardly observes any mode of dressing as part of office etiquette, and performance is gauged on the delivery of tasks assigned.\n\nWhat this means to organisations is that to attract and retain the best and brightest of Generation Z, it will require a different mindset. A large percentage of Gen Z is characterised by their passion for technology, knowledge, creativity, risk-taking, multi-skilledness, and readiness to adjust to new changes, especially technology-driven ones.\n\nI have witnessed the workplace evolution of aspirations from just being a good salary to the new \u2018normal\u2019. Gen Z is looking for a flexible work programme, opportunities to grow within the organisation, transparency in communication, diversity, and inclusion, and is considering how the work environment will affect their mental health.\n\nIn my experience as an HR practitioner, I have adjusted to accommodate Gen Z demands. This is an extremely impatient lot, but they are smart, hardworking, and risk-takers with a knack for perfection. This is a group of people who prefer instant feedback as opposed to an end-of-review set period for appraisal to take place.\n\nI have learned the importance of creating room for them to vent, speak their mind, and, if possible, have a one-on-one conversation aimed not at criticising but at implementing solutions. As a human relations professional, help employees connect their strengths to their work by providing training and development opportunities.\n\nWhat about Gen Z\u2019s level of engagement and the need for constant attention, fuelled partly by social media? Well, ensure that the expectations for the outcome are clear at the beginning of the contract and have regular checks in, if possible, monthly.\n\nGen Z employees want to feel safe, valued, and productive. It is about creating an environment where employees use their strengths every day. By embracing these changes and understanding Gen Z\u2019s values, businesses can position themselves for future success.\n\nCommunicate clearly and on time if there are any changes, allow room for creativity in the process of delivering work and finally ensure that you have supplied tools necessary to deliver work.",

    "body": "Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Kamau Thugge spoke to the Business Daily recently in the backdrop of his first year in office. The interview covered many subjects under his mandate, including foreign exchange, monetary policy, currencies, and the banking industry.\n\nYou had made the tough choice between raising domestic interest rates and cushioning the exchange rate with an adjustment to the benchmark lending rate, has this been the right course of action?\n\nIn a sense, it\u2019s choosing your poison. In my view, you need to deal with inflation and anchor inflation expectations, because if you don\u2019t, if inflation becomes something you can\u2019t control it affects the entire economy and ultimately, banks will not have negative real interest rates.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t push up interest rates and allow inflation to go to 30 percent, no bank will lend to you at less than 30 percent, so you will still have higher interest rates.\n\nAre we now at equilibrium with the shilling or at least close to it?\n\nRight now, there are significant foreign inflows but who knows\u2026for the time being we see stability and we don\u2019t interfere unless it\u2019s a sharp appreciation or depreciation. Broadly we allow the market to tell us what the equilibrium rate would be and so I wouldn\u2019t say whether we are at this point.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in core capital will trigger amalgamation in the industry, especially for banks unable to raise the higher Sh10 billion capital, will we see you forcing marriages between banks?\n\nI think we will allow it to play out between the banks and you know we have a microfinance sector. If you can\u2019t generate enough capital, it doesn\u2019t mean you shut down. Unless asked to be intermediate, I wouldn\u2019t see the need to force mergers.\n\nThere is a fear of creating concentration risks where you have big banks swallowing up everyone, Is this farfetched for you?\n\nI think we will still have quite a few banks, I don\u2019t think the issue of concentration is a concern. For purposes of competitiveness, having bigger banks enhances competitiveness. Right now when you have just a few big banks, they set the stage so to speak, and then the smaller banks just follow. Having bigger and more competitive banks will help us even lower interest rates.\n\nThere has been a push for an expanded mandate for the CBK in terms of the regulation of entities, do you feel the bank can take on more?\n\nWe have submitted some amendments to the Act to move away from digital credit to just credit because a lot of these credit providers are not always on digital platforms.\n\nYour predecessor was somewhat hands-off in terms of engaging stakeholders like banks, is your approach as a regulator different?\n\nMine is somewhat different, I have tried to engage the stakeholders as much as possible and we have had regular meetings with bank CEOs and their heads of treasuries.\n\nThey were part of resolving the exchange rate problem. I wouldn\u2019t want the hands-off approach, but that\u2019s not to suggest that we won\u2019t be very hard on them if they don\u2019t comply.\n\nOne of the first observations I made is that there seemed to be a number who were not complying because the penalties were so low. The penalties we are bringing on board will bring sanity, where banks will think twice before violating any CBK provisions.\n\nWhere do we stand today on the creation of a central bank digital currency?\n\nThe main conclusion was that given where we are in terms of financial inclusion, where we are quite ahead of others in terms of digital payments, going to a central bank for digital currency was not a priority, and this stand remains. Having said that, however, we need to keep up with what\u2019s going on in that space.\n\nLast year, CBK indicated it had no demand for new notes and coins, and we saw De la Rue pausing its business subsequently. Some might tell you they haven\u2019t seen any new notes around, has that demand returned?\n\nIf you look at currency in circulation, relative to gross domestic product, Kenya\u2019s is very low compared to countries like India. There will always be a need for some currency, but at the same time, there are developments in digital payments that continue to reduce the need for new currency. There will always be a need, but that need will keep reducing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should we expect more of from the CBK going into your second year in office?\n\nI\u2019ll take you back to the mandate, and the first is price stability. I think going forward we would like to maintain that, and we have already modernised our monetary framework.\n\nSecond is the stability of the financial system\u2014my vision is to have that stability\u2014fewer but stronger banks, which will not just come from a regional perspective.",

    "body": "The value of foreign currency loans and deposits held in local banks fell by Sh504.9 billion in three months ended March on the backdrop of a strengthening Kenya shilling, easing concerns about the lenders\u2019 exposure to external risks.\n\nDeposits in foreign currency fell sharply in the period, dropping to Sh1.63 trillion from Sh1.91 trillion in December 2023 as gains in local currency depleted the holdings of offshore notes in Kenya shilling terms.\n\nForeign currency loans equally fell, touching Sh990.2 billion from Sh1.21 trillion at the end of 2023.\n\nThe fall in foreign currency loans and deposits is a relief to banks after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned of high exposure.\n\n\u201cThe share of FX (foreign currency) loans declined somewhat in the third quarter of 2023 but remained higher than a year ago. Currently, an unremunerated cash reserve ratio of 4.25 percent applies to a bank\u2019s total domestic and FX deposit liabilities and is filled in shilling. There are no additional capital requirements on FX loans or exposure caps on FX loans,\u201d the IMF observed in a January report.\n\nThe share of Kenya\u2019s total foreign currency liabilities stood at 34.9 percent as of September 2023, beating the median of 31.6 percent for emerging and developing economies.\n\nThe IMF observed that foreign currency deposits were on the increase even after factoring in the depreciation of the exchange rate, which signalled a nominal increase in hard currency holdings across 2023.\n\nThe accumulation was attributable to banks increasing their ownership of foreign currency to service the government-to-government oil importation deal that started in March 2023 and to expectations of the continued depreciation of the Kenya shilling.\n\nThe multilateral lender underlined risks, including foreign currency access difficulties, in its caution against accumulating hard currency credit, particularly for foreign currency loans.\n\n\u201cA non-trivial portion of the FX loans are in sectors such as personal loans, real estate, transport and communication, and building and construction; it\u2019s unclear to what extent borrowers in these sectors have a natural hedge as these sectors are not main export sectors,\u201d the IMF added.\n\n\u201cBanks report that with the ongoing dollar shortage, FX borrowers who are unable to source for US dollars in the local market have been offering repayment in shilling, effectively defaulting on the loans and contributing to the rise in non-performing loans.\n\nFirms and businesses had resorted to contracting hard currency loans to access dollars amid the foreign exchange crisis observed across 2023.\n\nForeign currency liquidity has, however, improved through 2024 following reforms and interventions to halt the depreciation of the Kenya shilling, which have encouraged new inflows of hard currency into the economy.\n\nThe Kenyan shilling has been a gainer against major world currencies including the US dollar since mid-February and is part of the best-performing currencies in the world this year.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya quoted the local unit at Sh128.7 against the US dollar on Tuesday, representing gains of over 19 percent for the shilling on a year-to-date basis.",

The fertiliser subsidy programme was top of President William Ruto\u2019s agenda when he took power in September 2022 at a time the country was battling record-high maize prices.\n\nThis was largely due to a biting drought, said to be the worst in four decades, in 2022 and disruption in global supply chains that followed Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, pushing up the global prices of fertiliser to record levels.\n\nThe government cushion on prices helped cut the cost for a 50-kilogramme bag of subsidized fertiliser from highs of Sh6,500 to Sh3,500 initially before falling to current levels of Sh2,500.\n\n\u201cIn order to support agricultural production, the Government rolled out a countrywide farmer registration and fertiliser subsidy programme that has made available 5.5 million bags to farmers across Kenya,\u201d Treasury wrote in the 2024 Budget Policy Statement (BPS).",

However, one claim, EOT 5 was not assessed.\n\nZakhem had put in a Sh18.4 billion claim but the expert scheduler, M/s Nyara reduced the amount to Sh4.4 billion.\n\nMs Gathungu said despite the assessed amount having been agreed by both parties, KPC management declined to pay the amount leading to the contractor seeking redress in the High Court in a suit filed on September 26, 2019.",

Retail investors who applied for more than 2,500 shares, for instance, received 10 free shares for each 100 shares allocated. Institutional investors who applied for at least 1.85 billion shares were offered 112 free shares for each 100 shares allocated.\n\nDespite the incentive shares, which amounted to a discount on the offer price, the IPO only managed a subscription rate of 54.45 percent in a transaction that saw Uganda\u2019s National Social Security Fund (NSSF) take up about 97 percent of the allocated shares.\n\nThe below par performance of the telco\u2019s IPO was partly attributed to exclusion of Airtel Money which is owned separately by Airtel Africa and a group of other institutional investors. MTN Uganda offered both its mobile money and telecommunications businesses to the investing public.\n\nAirtel Uganda\u2019s share price has declined post-IPO to trade at Ush70 (Sh2.45), indicating that its parent firm could offer deeper discounts to meet local ownership requirement in the impending secondary offer.\n\nAirtel Uganda, which offers data, SMS and voice services, has a policy of distributing at least 95 percent of net income as dividends.\n\nMTN Group sold an extra 7.03 percent stake in MTN Uganda\u2019s oversubscribed secondary offer last month, cutting its ownership in the subsidiary to 80 percent. It sold 1.57 billion shares at a price of Ush170 (Sh5.9) each in the transaction that featured incentive shares.\n\nThis was a larger discount compared to MTN Uganda\u2019s November 2021 IPO in which the multinational sold a 12.97 percent stake at a price of Ush200 (Sh6.95) per share while also offering incentive shares.\n\nPricing of the secondary offer took into account a drop in the share price of MTN Uganda, which currently stands at Ush170 (Sh5.9). The sale of MTN Uganda shares was open to Ugandan and foreign investors.\n\nMTN Uganda\u2019s successful secondary offer was also helped by extension of the book closure date for its final dividend of Ush6.4 (Sh0.22) per share from June 4 to June 12. This enabled investors who participated in the offer to qualify for the payout. The offer closed on June 10.\n\nMTN Uganda, which aims to pay out at least 60 percent of profits as dividends, has attracted notable Kenyan investors including billionaire Baloobhai Patel, Central Bank of Kenya and the National Social Security Fund.",

In March last year the lender issued an alert over an impending closure of its operations in three East African markets\u2014 Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania\u2014this year over worsening conditions.\n\nIt classified the three regions (Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania) including Ghana and Nigeria as \u2018turnaround markets\u2019 which are currently unfit for growth and appointed a turnaround master Fergus Ferguson, the former Chief Executive of Botswana with oversight over Eswatini and Lesotho (Boleswa), as the regional CEO to oversee their recovery in 10 months, failure to which a closure decision will be made this year to avoid further financial bleeding.",

    "title": "What ails affordable housing project",
    "body": "From the latest anecdotal evidence I have gathered, indications are that all is not well with the Affordable Housing Project which is touted as President William Ruto administration\u2019s biggest signature project.\n\nCurrently, a major controversy has erupted between the bureaucracy in charge of the project and a group of 33 consultants-mainly architects and quantity surveyors- over delayed payments.\n\nLast week, and with the financial year coming to a close, expectations were high that the consultants would be paid during the traditional end of fiscal year scramble when ministries rush to clear payments lest monies be returned to the Exchequer. A meeting called at a Nairobi hotel on Friday with the consultants resolved the dispute.\n\nIt is not a god sign because in view of the scope of this giant project, maintaining the support from the community and fraternity of consultants is critical to delivery and success.\n\nFrom what I have gathered from private conversations with the players in this space, it seems decision- making is impeded by lack of clear lines of command within the bureaucracy running the project.\n\nHolding an office is not the same thing as being in power. Cabinet Secretary Alice Wahome holds a big office and so does the Principal Secretary, Charles Hinga. But from my reading when I map the play of effective power and decision- making is that Housing Secretary, Said Athman, is also a very powerful player.\n\nClearly, rolling out this project is going to be the biggest test on President Ruto administration\u2019s capacity to successfully roll out large infrastructure projects. It reminds me of Francis Fukuyama\u2019s writings on the concept of State capacity, described as the ability of a government to deliver large infrastructure projects on time.\n\nWithin the region, the government of Ethiopia is regarded as having a better record at delivering projects on time and within budget. Does it surprise that we have contracted the Ethiopians to sell to us a lot of electricity from its dams? Even little Rwanda is rated higher than us in terms of capacity to implement large infrastructure in time and at cost.\n\nWe went into this massive affordable housing project without thinking through it properly and before agreeing on the feasible model. Clearly, the government has been involved in miss and hit experimentation.\n\nWhen it started, the model was based on an invitation to private sector to \u2018design, finance, build and transfer\u2019 affordable houses at fixed price of Sh50,000 per square metre on the guarantee of an off-taker. The government would buy all the units on completion. Indeed, the most attractive aspects of the programme was free land and the off-taker guarantee.\n\nThe next stage was to provide a proof of concept. This was achieved after President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s administration contracted the Chinese group, China State Corporation- who built and completed 1,300 affordable housing units in the Park Road area in Ngara, Nairobi.\n\nWith the concept having been approved, the Ministry of Lands and Housing went on a spree of advertising free land sites. I have lost count of the number of newspaper adverts put up by Mr Hinga to offer free land to developers in different parts of the country.\n\nAt some point, the model was suddenly changed from \u2018design, finance, build, and transfer\u2019 to a \u2018development split\u2019 model whereby the government would only guarantee off-take of 70 percent of the units, with the developer allowed to sell the remaining units at market rates.\n\nWith the change of model- and without an off-taker guarantee, the developers dried up. The second round of the project covering Starehe, and Shauri Moyo in Nairobi was hit by inadequate investor appetite. As a matter of fact, one developer walked away. The collapse of the housing levy bill was a big factor.\n\nIn January 2022, 59 sites throughout the country were advertised. Only Kingdom Developers and Gulf showed up. After the General Elections, Mr Hinga advertised 70 additional sites- including land belonging to the Kenya Police and Kenya Defence Forces. There was even a time when university student\u2019s halls were brought on board. Still, no serious takers.\n\nWith the advent of President Ruto\u2019s administration, the model changed again because-this time around- the housing levy had been enacted. The government now became the designer. All that was needed was to engage construction companies.\n\nAlthough the response to offers was very good, the bids were way higher than the fixed price of Sh50,000 per square metre. Consultants had to be brought in to review the designs. They have not been paid.",

    "title": "Manufacturing grows at slowest pace since 2008 post-poll crisis",
    "body": "The manufacturing sector posted the slowest growth in 16 years in the first three months of 2024, spooked by high production costs and a recent barrage of tax measures, dealing a blow to prospects of generating quality jobs in the economy.\n\nData by the Kenya National Bureau of Standards (Kebs) show that the sector grew by 1.3 percent in the quarter to March compared to 1.7 percent a year prior - the slowest pace since the same quarter of 2008 when it grew by a paltry 0.7 percent amid deadly violence and economic disruption caused by the disputed outcome of the 2007 presidential election.\n\n\u201cGrowth in the manufacture of food products was constrained by a 6.5 percent decline in soft drink production during the quarter under review. In the manufacture of non-food products, cement production declined from 2.3 million tonnes in the same quarter of 2023 to 2.1 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2024,\u201d KNBS stated in its GDP report for the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe poor growth performance leaves the sector-- which has the highest multiplier effect on the economy-- on the ropes despite being touted as a key pillar of the Kenya Kwanza administration, which sees industry driving the next phase of Kenya\u2019s economic transformation.\n\nThe slump in manufacturing puts a damper on the government's ambitions of raising the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP to 20 percent by 2030 as productivity falls. Local manufacturers, who are members of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM), have set the same target under their \u201820by30\u2019 agenda.\n\nThe share of manufacturing to Kenya\u2019s GDP stood at 7.6 percent in 2023 in contrast to a high of 10 percent in 2014. The sector also contributed just 9,700 of the 848,100 new jobs created in the economy in 2023 or 1.14 percent.\n\nIndustrialists cite a recent wave of punitive tax measures and high costs of production for the dismal performance in the sector.\n\nFor example, the export and promotion levy introduced through the Finance Act, 2023 set a tax of 17.5 percent of the customs value of imported cement clinkers and other manufacturing-related products such as bars and rods, impacting the cost of finished products from local manufacturers.\n\nOnly Bamburi Cement, Mombasa Cement, and Simba Cement manufacture clinker locally, according to KAM, highlighting constrained productivity by other cement makers on higher input costs.\n\n\u201cBecause of that constrained production, the capacity to manufacture cement has gone down while the cost of a bag of cement has risen from lows of Sh560 to upwards of Sh850 in some places. This has impacted other sectors such as construction and real estate,\u201d noted KAM CEO Anthony Mwangi.\n\nThe new taxes have exacerbated the struggles of a sector already bogged down by high production costs, including that of imports and electricity.\n\nCostly energy is being blamed on inefficiencies in generation, transmission, and distribution. Mr Mwangi said manufacturing has been shaken on both the demand and supply side, inhibiting gains for sector expected to carry the multiplier effect in the economy, including job creation.\n\n\u201cWe operate in an ecosystem and just looking at the overall economic environment, you look at interest rates going up, so has the cost of living which has hit the demand for manufactured products by consumers. On the supply side, we face high input costs including energy, taxes, and regulatory levies paid to entities such as Kebs [Kenya Bureau of Standards] and Nema [National Environment Management Authority] alongside the cost and tenure of credit. Everywhere you turn, costs come at you,\u201d he added.\n\nThe problems bedevilling manufacturing, according to KAM, include trade in counterfeit products, transport and storage issues, and weak access to credit financing.\n\nUnder its Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), President William Ruto identified key value chains, including leather, textiles, dairy, edible oils, building and construction materials, as important in efforts to boost manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP.\n\nKey allocations to the sector in the fiscal year ended June 30 included Sh4.7 billion for the establishment of county-integrated agro-industrial parks and Sh550 million for the completion of the Naivasha Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and the construction of Dongo Kundu SEZ.\n\nA further Sh2.8 billion was set aside for the development of the Athi River Textile Hub and Sh3 billion for six EPZ flagship hubs.\n\nIn January, the government revealed it would be putting up 30 additional county aggregation and industrial parks, lifting the number from an initial 18.\n\nThe push for new manufacturing infrastructure has come against the continued erosion of existing factories as industrial areas now face encroachment from entertainment spots after the barrage of residential houses.\n\nKAM, while acknowledging the drag on activity from the recent anti-tax protests in the country, sees the opportunity to overhaul government policies in the face of public discourse, resetting manufacturing back to the growth path.",

Five of their planes are currently grounded at JKIA because they have not been able to get engine parts to run them,\u201d said a source in the industry.\n\nThe five planes currently stuck at JKIA without engine parts to run them are a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, two Embraer E-190s and two Boeing 737-300s.\n\nA Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner operates on long-haul routes while an Embraer E-190 operates short-haul and medium routes. Boeing 737-300 aircraft operates medium haul routes.\n\nThe airline\u2019s officials had not responded to our query by the time of going to press.\n\nOn June 30 alone, at least 16 flights were either cancelled or delayed.\n\nThis includes KQ604, KQ608 and KQ618 to Mombasa, which were canceled. KQ270 to Mauritius was cancelled while KQ886 to Bangkok was delayed by eight hours and 50 minutes. On July 1, 2024, several flights were affected too. This includes flight KQ362 to Mogadishu and flight KQ 594 to Douala.\n\nThe national carrier has grappled with inadequate staffing and equipment in the wake of the global travel's recovery from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic that broke out in early 2020.\n\nKenya Airways had let go of some of its employees in 2020 to cut costs due to depressed earnings caused by the pandemic but has been hiring more in the past few years.\n\nThe airline is under pressure to deploy more crew members and aircraft to service routes that were idle during the Covid-19 period.\n\nThe country is also staring at a peak tourism season, which started early this month. The airline currently flies to 45 destinations and faces stiff competition, not just from major players like Qatar Airways, Emirates and Turkish Airlines, but from African carriers as well.\n\nThe government-owned Ethiopian Airlines is the biggest regional threat and flies to more than 120 destinations.\n\nBoth Uganda and Tanzania have poured cash into their flag carriers in the past three years, joining countries such as Rwanda and Togo, which have also ramped up investment in their own carriers.",

    "body": "Amid heated protests in the country against the new proposed taxes that have now been dropped, a new survey has found that a vast majority of Kenyans would be okay with the government introducing taxes that target only the rich.\n\nThe survey done by research firm Ipsos, and commissioned by economic think tank Earth4All, reveals that 76 percent of Kenyans would support a higher income tax rate on wealthy people, and 70 percent strongly agree that the rich should pay a tax on their wealth.\n\nA majority of Kenyans, about 81 percent, would also support a proposal to have large businesses pay a higher tax rate, and 76 percent would like the State to tax companies and individuals polluting the environment, the study published last week shows.\n\nIpsos surveyed 1,000 Kenyans between March 5 and April 8, 2024, for the research.\n\nAccording to the study, which was conducted in 18 G20 countries including Kenya, most locals who support taxing the wealthy view it as an effective means of redistributing income in a country characterised by a huge inequality gap.\n\nAlmost nine in 10 Kenyans (84 percent) believe that there\u2019s \u201ctoo much economic inequality\u201d in the country these days, and only 37 percent believe in the capitalistic notion that everyone will be better off if only a few people get richer.\n\nAs such, Kenyans would like the additional tax income raised from the wealth taxes to be used in economically equalising the country, with about 65 percent saying the government should give every Kenyan a universal basic income (UBI), and 86 percent saying citizens should have access to free or affordable healthcare.\n\nCompared to South Africa, the only other country on the continent surveyed among the 21, Kenyans show a stronger support for wealth taxes and their utilisation in redistribution of income.\n\nIn South Africa, 71 percent support a higher income tax on the wealthy, compared to Kenya\u2019s 76 percent, and 74 percent would have large businesses pay a higher tax, compared to Kenya\u2019s 81 percent.\n\nSupport for wealth taxes is highest in Indonesia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, where up to 86 percent of the citizens believe the government should impose a tax on wealth for richer citizens.\n\nKenya currently has few taxes directly on wealth. The closest similarity to a wealth tax in the country is the land rates, whose collection is relatively lower than other jurisdictions around the globe, and the Capital Gains Tax, which was last year raised from five percent to 10 percent. This is charged on the gains from disposal of an asset.\n\nStill, it appears Kenyans would like more taxes targeting only the wealthy and high-income earners.\n\nPresident William Ruto had alluded to the introduction of new wealth taxes at the onset of his administration in September 2022, when he told lawmakers that Kenya taxes trade more and wealth less.",

    "title": "Hackers leak alleged Taylor Swift ticket data to extort Ticketmaster",
    "body": "Hackers claimed this week that they had obtained barcode data for hundreds of thousands of tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour, demanding that Ticketmaster pay millions in ransom money or they would leak the information online.\n\nThe hacking group posted samples of the data to an online forum\u2013 ticket data on Swift\u2019s shows in Indianapolis, Miami, and New Orleans \u2013 and alleged it possessed an additional 30m million barcodes for other high-profile concerts and sporting events.\n\nThe ransom posts on the online forum were from the hacking group ShinyHunters, and an account that appeared to be associated with it called Sp1d3rHunters. The group has a history of claiming responsibility for major hacks against companies including Santander bank, AT&T, Microsoft and others.\n\nTicketmaster denied offering any money to the hackers, who had not engaged with the company about the ransom, according to a statement from parent Live National Entertainment. Ticketmaster also stated that its ticketing technology prevented such leaked barcodes from being used as tickets by refreshing barcodes every few seconds.\n\nHopeful Swifties probably won\u2019t be able to attend their icon\u2019s world tour with an ill-gotten ticket. Although the data appeared to be from the hacking group\u2019s large scale breach of Ticketmaster and Live Nation earlier this year, cybersecurity experts who examined the leak agreed that the stolen data would not be useful for gaining access to an arena. The data could not be used as a ticket because the Ticketmaster mobile application uses dynamic barcodes, experts said, whereas the data in the hack is static.\n\n\u201cThis data is almost certainly not sufficient to allow someone to recreate a barcode to get in,\u201d said Don Smith, vice-president at the cybersecurity firm Secureworks. \u201cIf you\u2019re running events of the size and scale of the Eras tour, you are not going to make it easy for someone to just get access to a database and then be able to create a fake ticket.\u201d\n\nDespite ShinyHunters\u2019 ability to gain access to the Swift ticketing data, which included information on tickets for nine upcoming dates across the three US cities, experts said that companies such as Live Nation have more sophisticated measures to prevent that data from being used to actually steal tickets.\n\n\u201cIf the thought here was that you\u2019re going to create absolute chaos on all future Eras tour dates, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe ransom threat to Live Nation is part of a broader rise in cyberattacks and ransomware in recent years. The attacks have targeted major corporations and public institutions, with analysts estimating that victims paid out $1.1bn in ransoms in 2023. The United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service is still reeling from a devastating attack by a Russia-based ransomware gang in June.\n\nEarlier this year, ShinyHunters allegedly breached a third party contractor to gain access to Ticketmaster\u2019s data that included the names, partial payment details, phone numbers, ticket sales and other information on around 560 million customers. LiveNation confirmed the hack in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in May after ShinyHunters took credit for the attack.\n\nThe hack added to Live Nation\u2019s myriad of public relations problems and legal woes. The US Department of Justice sued the company in May, alleging it was illegally monopolizing ticket sales and seeking to break it up. Live Nation also faced widespread backlash over its handling of Swift\u2019s Eras tour, with a botched sales process leading to hours-long waits, failure to handle consumer demand and tickets going on resale for exorbitant amounts. Swift herself has bashed the company repeatedly.\n\nSwift\u2019s tour has been the target of cyberattacks before. In February, hackers breached Australian events company Ticketek, breaking into individual accounts and reselling Eras tour tickets. The company set up pop-up stands outside Swift\u2019s shows for fans to report their concerns and potentially regain their tickets.\n\nShinyHunters has also claimed responsibility for accessing bank and credit card numbers for around 30 million customers and employees at Santander bank earlier this year. The group attempted to sell that information to the highest bidder. In May, the FBI and US Department of Justice seized the online forum that ShinyHunters used to post information and ransom threats from its Live Nation and Santander hacks, but another site quickly popped up.",

    "body": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s decision to cut 250 jobs at Manchester United, which caused shock and tears from some employees, will save about \u00a310m a year. With the redundancies worth an estimated \u00a340,000 a head, the saving is part of Ratcliffe\u2019s drive to restructure the club and make it sustainable.\n\nThere is a recognition among the workforce that United have become a bloated operation and the Guardian reported last December that up to 300 jobs were under threat. But when the planned redundancies were communicated at an all-staff meeting on Wednesday, there was surprise among a number of those attending in person or remotely.\n\nThe meeting, which began at noon, was scheduled for an hour but lasted only 15 minutes. The announcement was led by Jean-Claude Blanc, the acting chief executive, who will stand down when Omar Berrada begins as the permanent CEO on 13 July.\n\nBerrada has been on gardening leave since his hiring from Manchester City in January and is expected to join United\u2019s summer tour of the US, which begins when Erik ten Hag\u2019s team fly to Los Angeles on 24 July.\n\nTen Hag signed a new deal to 2026 on Thursday after a review of his candidacy which included Jason Wilcox, the technical director, speaking with numerous potential replacements. Despite the transparent consideration given to replacing the manager, Ten Hag and Ratcliffe\u2019s leadership team recognise the need for unity if United are to be successful.\n\nUnited retain a firm interest in signing the centre-backs Jarrad Branthwaite and Matthijs de Ligt from Everton and Bayern Munich respectively. However Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Harry Maguire may have to be sold for both to be signed because of financial imperatives.\n\nLast month United had a \u00a345m offer for Branthwaite rejected. They will make a second bid only if Everton indicate a willingness to lower their valuation, thought to be a minimum of \u00a360m. United believe De Ligt is worth between \u00a340m and \u00a350m.\n\nOn Friday United and Nice, who are also owned by Ratcliffe, were cleared by Uefa to compete together in next season\u2019s Europa League. Uefa also ruled that Manchester City and their sister club Girona could play in the Champions League.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "title": "Houses and pylons: Labour\u2019s biggest business challenges",
    "body": "A landslide victory for Labour was also a satisfactory result for the vigilantes of the bond market. A Conservative administration that served up Liz Truss\u2019s reckless budget of unfunded giveaways in 2022 has been punished. A Labour party promising fiscal discipline, to the point where it ditched a previous flagship \u00a328bn policy on green investment in case it scared the horses, has been rewarded.\n\nSo, yes, one can see why the UK has suddenly acquired haven-like status in the eyes of financial markets. Unlike the US and France, for instance, international investors now know what they\u2019re getting with the UK: a stable government anxious to demonstrate its market-friendly credentials. Meanwhile, inflation is falling and cuts in interest rates lie around the corner. \u201cWe believe UK government bonds (gilts) are attractive at current levels,\u201d said Peder Beck-Friis, an economist at Pimco, the enormous bond fund manager.\n\nAll that is very helpful for attracting investors, as the incoming chancellor, Rachel Reeves, emphasised throughout the campaign; the big-picture outlook for growth and investment could be worse. Here, though, are two detailed pro-growth targets that look hard to achieve but are central to Labour\u2019s plans. First, the new government wants 1.5m homes to be built in England and Wales in the next five years. Second, it intends to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030.\n\nOn houses, Labour starts from a position where as few as 150,000 might be built this year, half what it needs for a par annual score for its five-year target. Talk to the executives in the housebuilding sector and many think that the ministers will have done well if they get to the implied annual run rate of 300,000 by the end of parliament.\n\nThe ingredient that ministers can directly influence is the planning rules. Reeves has called the planning system \u201cthe single biggest obstacle to our economic success\u201d and Keir Starmer promised last year to \u201cbulldoze through\u201d the UK\u2019s \u201crestrictive planning system\u201d. The taboo of building on the green belt \u2013 or, at least, the \u201cgrey\u201d parts of it \u2013 will be challenged. So expect a return to local authorities being given mandatory targets for housebuilding, as a first step, and funding for planning officers to follow.\n\nEven so, the 1.5m target looks a stretch: supply chains cannot simply be turned on by government diktat. And Labour\u2019s parallel demand for more affordable houses within the mix may cause tensions with big private-sector housebuilders, which dominate the market to a far greater degree than in the 1970s, the last time the UK was building at such a rate.\n\nLabour wants to double onshore wind, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by 2030. Photograph: Spencer Bowman/Getty\n\nOn energy infrastructure, there is at least a blueprint for reform. Nick Winser, the electricity commissioner, delivered his report to the previous government last August. But note the size of the job, even when the Conservatives were pursuing a deadline of 2035. \u201cIn Great Britain, around four times as much new transmission network will be needed in the next seven years as was built since 1990,\u201d said Winser\u2019s report.\n\nThe biggest impediment are blockages created by the \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d system of allocating hookups to the grid for new wind, solar and battery storage projects. Some developers have been waiting up to 15 years to produce power. The worry is that the system is being gamed by operators who are more interested in selling on a connection rather than building the infrastructure themselves. Ofgem, the regulator, now has rules to kick out such \u201czombie\u201d schemes but, again, that process does not happen overnight.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "title": "\u2018Beyond marketing, beyond explanation\u2019: how Inside Out and Despicable Me saved the summer",
    "body": "Five weeks ago, Hollywood was in the doldrums. A succession of hotly tipped blockbusters \u2013 The Fall Guy, Furiosa, IF \u2013 flopped. The mood was ominous. The last time early summer box-office takings had been so low was in 2000.\n\nToday, considerably more cheerful records are being broken, thanks entirely to children\u2019s films. Three weeks ago saw the release of Inside Out 2, Pixar\u2019s sequel to its 2015 animation about the emotions jostling for supremacy in the head of an 11-year-old girl named Riley.\n\nEven the most optimistic-seeming predictions were that it would make $80m (\u00a362m) on its first weekend of release in the US. In fact, it made $155m (\u00a3121m). On its second weekend, ticket sales only dropped by 35% (by comparison, Barbie\u2019s fell 43% over the same period in 2023). Last week, Pixar\u2019s latest became the fastest film ever to make a billion dollars worldwide \u2013 in just 19 days.\n\nIn the US, however, it will lose its place at the top of the chart this weekend, when it is toppled by another children\u2019s animation sequel. Despicable Me 4 opened in the US on Wednesday, taking $27m (\u00a321m), and is on course for a five-day total of $120m (\u00a394m) over the Independence Day holiday. (It opens in the UK next Friday.)\n\n\u201cSuccess begets success,\u201d says Steven Gaydos, executive editor of Variety. Parents who enjoyed taking their children to Inside Out 2 are now primed to repeat the experience. \u201cA rising tide lifts all boats.\u201d\n\nMy six-year-old thinks Inside Out 2 is the funniest movie he\u2019s ever seen. My mom thinks it\u2019s the saddest. It\u2019s many movies in one Dave Holstein, screenwriter\n\nYet the scale and speed of Inside Out 2\u2019s triumph remains mysterious. \u201cIts explosive success is a potent reminder of what happens when everyone in the world wants to see the same movie,\u201d says Gaydos. \u201cThere is pent up demand that lands on the same square the same day. It\u2019s beyond marketing, beyond explanation.\u201d\n\nChris Meledandri, founder and CEO of Illumination, a division of Universal Pictures and the production studio behind Despicable Me, concurs. \u201cPeople were missing the cinema,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the minute the signals started to flash that Inside Out 2 was the film they\u2019d been waiting for, you saw a kind of a spontaneous eruption.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Chris Meledandri. Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nEven Inside Out 2\u2019s writers were taken aback. \u201cIt\u2019s always surprising when four million people show up to your movie,\u201d says Dave Holstein. His father texted to apologise for not being able to see it over opening weekend. \u201cGo to a different theater,\u201d his son texted back. \u201cAll sold out,\u201d came the reply. \u201cEvery screen, every time.\u201d\n\nWhen Holstein\u2019s co-writer, Meg LeFauve, went to her local cinema on the first Saturday after the film\u2019s release, she was struck by the sight of the popcorn queue snaking round the block. \u201cAt the end of the film,\u201d she says, \u201ceverybody stood up and cheered. I thought: \u2018Oh, OK, we might\u2019ve touched a chord. This could be big.\u2019\u201d\n\nMuch was resting on Inside Out 2\u2019s pulling power. Pixar head Pete Docter, who directed the first film and executive produced the second, last month admitted to muted hopes and minimal fingernails. Should the sequel sink at the cinema, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to think even more radically about how we run our business\u201d.\n\nThe problem Docter identified was a pandemic hangover. Pixar\u2019s decision to release two key titles, Soul and Elemental, straight to streaming had likely habituated audiences to seeing such films on their own sofas.\n\nHowever, Holstein thinks this trend may have helped Inside Out 2. \u201cThe number of people who have seen the first film has grown exponentially since it first came out, because so many people have now caught up with it on Disney+.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Dave Holstein and Meg LeFauve at the Inside Out 2 premiere. Photograph: Alberto E Rodr\u00edguez/Getty Images for Disney/Pixar\n\nInside Out 2 is a family film with cross-generational appeal. It appeals to young children, teenagers (the new movie sees Riley\u2019s headquarters co-opted by Anxiety as she turns 13), twentysomethings who loved the first film, plus parents and grandparents. \u201cIt\u2019s many movies in one,\u201d says Holstein. \u201cMy six-year-old thinks it\u2019s the funniest movie he\u2019s ever seen. My mom thinks it\u2019s the saddest movie she\u2019s ever seen. When my son sees it in 10 years, he\u2019ll have a whole different movie to watch.\u201d\n\nWhile less obviously ambitious offerings such as Super Mario Bros (2023\u2019s second-best-performing film, after Barbie), plus 2024\u2019s Kung Fu Panda 4 ($545m/\u00a3425m) and Garfield ($240m/\u00a3187m), were respectable performers, their target demographic is narrower and takings were correspondingly capped.\n\nAt the end of the film everyone stood up and cheered. I thought: \u2018Oh, we might\u2019ve touched a chord. This could be big\u2019 Meg LeFauve, screenwriter\n\nInside Out\u2019s reach, by contrast, means it performs less like a family film and more like an event movie in the moulds of Marvel or Barbie. Nineteen per cent of its opening weekend audience were aged between 25 and 34, and 18% were between 18 and 24. It seems adults aren\u2019t only willing and eager to take the children \u2013 they\u2019re willing and eager to go without them.\n\nMore surprisingly, this also appears to be the case with Despicable Me 4. Exit figures from its first day of US release suggest 59% of the audience were over 18, with a further 20% aged 13-17. \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding,\u201d says Meledandri, \u201cis that there\u2019s a very strong nostalgia factor, which means it\u2019s actually playing across all ages.\u201d\n\nAudiences\u2019 responses also more closely mirror those towards \u201ca full-blown comedy\u201d, says Meledandri, than traditional family fare. \u201cAnd comedy in theatrical films is becoming more and more rare.\u201d Even rarer is mainstream comedy that translates across international territories \u2013 something at which the film\u2019s Spanglish-jabbering minion characters (\u201clanguage-agonistic,\u201d says Meledandri) are old pros.\n\n\u201cEvery part of the world can really lay claim to them in a primary manner,\u201d says Meledandri, \u201cand have the exact same enjoyment.\u201d\n\nBoth films also boast a significant female skew. Inside Out 2 features almost no male characters, while Gru\u2019s focus remains on protecting the three orphan girls he has adopted.\n\nAnd both are buoyed by having a nimble US improv star fronting their promotional drive: Steve Carell (who voices Gru) in the case of Despicable Me 4, and for Inside Out 2, Amy Poehler, who voices Joy.\n\n\u201cThey both have incredible comedy chops, but also huge hearts,\u201d says LeFauve. \u201cAmy is inseparable from Joy. So it\u2019s wonderful from a marketing perspective that she really seems to walk out of the screen.\u201d\n\nYet the business model behind the two series diverges dramatically. Meledandri founded Illumination in 2007, when \u201ca consistency of box-office success\u201d for market leaders DreamWorks, Disney and Pixar meant \u201cthe pressure wasn\u2019t really there on cost containment\u201d.\n\nHis strategy put sustainability at the centre \u2013 with rapid returns. The Despicable Me series is now the top-grossing animated franchise of all time, with box-office takings of almost $5bn (\u00a33.9bn). Profit margins are widened by budget consistency: the first Despicable Me cost $69m (\u00a353.8m) in 2010, the fourth cost $70m (\u00a354.6m). Inside Out 2 cost $200m (\u00a3156m).\n\nView image in fullscreen Vanessa Feltz and family attend screening of Despicable Me 4 in London. Photograph: Stuart C Wilson/Getty Images for Universal Pictures UK\n\n\u201cThe old formula that the second instalment would do 75% of the business of the first film, and so on, has been thrown out of the window,\u201d says Gaydos.\n\nMeledandri\u2019s model has set significant industry precedent. Now, \u201cmanaging costs has become much more prevalent,\u201d he says, applauding Disney for doing so within such a large and long-established organisation.\n\nDespite this belt-tightening, says Gaydos, \u201cright now, anyone who is in the animation field must be feeling really good. These look like good bets to people who invest in a big way with family movies.\u201d\n\nAnd the key word, he says, is \u201cfamily\u201d \u2013 not \u201canimation\u201d. \u201cRemember that Barbie, which was a huge movie, an Oscars movie, a talking-point movie, was still a movie about a kids\u2019 toy.\u201d\n\nThe difference is that family films are now the predominant genre for everyone. The pictures stayed small. It\u2019s the audiences that got big.",

    "body": "Greg Jackson, CEO and founder of Octopus Energy\n\nView image in fullscreen Greg Jackson Photograph: Octopus Energy/PA\n\nThis result is a landslide for the green economy. There\u2019s hundreds of billions of pounds in capital waiting to come into the UK\u2019s green energy sector \u2013 but in recent years the political instability in the UK means investors have lacked the confidence to make this happen.\n\nIn the run-up to this election the Labour party spent a good couple of years speaking to business leaders in the energy sector, and across the economy, about their concerns. The amount of dialogue they have had means they know what business needs, and they now have the parliamentary majority to deliver it.\n\nThis is a golden opportunity for a Labour government to deliver bold reforms which can unleash green growth. And the sooner they start, the sooner these changes can bring benefit to the UK. Planning reform is arcane and complex and challenging, but this is the key to kickstarting growth.\n\nMargherita Della Valle, chief executive of Vodafone Group\n\nView image in fullscreen Margherita Della Valle Photograph: Vodafone/Reuters\n\nThe new government is right to focus on growth and boosting investment. It is also good to see that Labour will place investment in infrastructure at the heart of its industry strategy. Understandably, with the UK\u2019s stretched public finances, there will also be a greater focus on the private sector to support the much-needed injection of investment to fuel this growth.\n\nUnderpinning the potential of so many different sectors are networks and connectivity. Yet at a time when network infrastructure has never been more important to the economy, the UK is falling behind. Labour\u2019s manifesto rightly recognises the issue through its commitment to \u201cnational 5G coverage by 2030\u201d.\u201d\n\nMick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers\u2019 union Aslef\n\nView image in fullscreen Mick Whelan Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer\n\nThe opportunity to give hope and aspiration to millions, after a decade and a half, cannot be underestimated. There is a massive task, with 14 million in poverty after 14 years of economic incompetence. This Labour government can make work pay, grow the economy, and give ordinary people their voice back.\n\nCloser to home, it must grow green integrated transport, rather than protecting the failed private interests of a quarter of a century of rail privatisation.\n\nWe look forward to early discussions on resolving the longest rail dispute in history. Aslef expect nothing, but naturally hope for a resolution. And we think, though we don\u2019t know, that it\u2019s possible. The Tory government was obstructive, effectively acting as puppet master to the train operating companies. If this Labour government allows us to deal with the employers, without their hands being tied, anything is possible.\n\nJennie Daly, CEO of housebuilder Taylor Wimpey\n\nView image in fullscreen Jennie Daly\n\nHousing delivery has a vital role to play in our society and in unlocking economic growth across the UK through investment, not just into much-needed energy efficient new homes, but in the associated investment in community infrastructure such as schools and amenities, and local transport infrastructure.\n\nA decade-long problem of under-resourcing in the planning system and lack of ambition at all political levels has driven a rapid decline in both new housing development and planning consents across the country, and so we welcome the Labour party\u2019s longstanding focus on the reform of planning policy and look forward to working closely with them to enable the delivery of critical new housing.\u201d\n\nAlastair Currie, CEO of events equipment hire group SLX\n\nView image in fullscreen Alastair Currie\n\nQuite frankly, [the past few years] have been chaotic, I\u2019ve felt very lonely, and on my own [as a business], and you just have to deal with what you can control in front of you. I think we\u2019ve got to have a change. And I sincerely hope that it does make a difference.\n\n\n\nI know it\u2019s not going to be quick, because there are so many calls on government funds with the health service and education. I just think that we need a longer, more strategic plan for our relationships with Europe. It seems crazy not to be more open in a market that we\u2019re so close to.\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s really been driven home to me over the last six months [working on the Paris Olympics], just how difficult we\u2019ve made life for ourselves. It just doesn\u2019t help with relationships, either, because it creates an awkward divide.\n\n\n\nFrom the new government, I would love better European relationships and I think some stability around taxes for business would be good. And if there could be a squeeze on the interest rate, that\u2019d be amazing too.\n\nAndy Higginson, chair of JD Group and of the British Retail Consortium\n\nAndy Higginson Photograph: Emma Slater\n\nWe hope for but don\u2019t expect a bit of boost from the arrival of a new government. The situation isn\u2019t great in terms of the economy and they need to be brave to tackle some of the issues.\n\nI was impressed by [shadow chancellor] Rachel Reeves and her perspective on City regulation and the need to get that side of the economy driving. The investing environment in the UK is weak and banks are off the pitch for a lot of small and medium-sized businesses. The stock market is weak in terms of valuations and the amount of money flowing into things. I think with her economist background she seems to have a good plan for that.\n\nLabour have said they will look at business rates and all retailers are looking at that with some hope. I think they know it\u2019s a distorted tax in sense that it is old and out of date and needs adjustment to create a level playing field.\n\nOn workers\u2019 rights, we employ a lot of people at the lower end of the pay scale and for them to be a bit better-off is good. What we don\u2019t want to do is affect the competitivity of business, and Labour have tried to reassure on that. I am hoping the reforms will be sensible and not drag on any of the good things in the economy like flexibility.\n\nPhil Urban, CEO of pubs and restaurants group Mitchells & Butlers\n\nView image in fullscreen Phil Urban\n\nAll changes of government bring opportunities and challenges that businesses have to take advantage of or overcome. At M&B we have not spent much time overthinking what a Labour government will mean other than looking at their manifesto. We will cross the bridges as they arise, and seek out how to optimise all the changes they make.\n\n\n\nIn terms of hopes, we would like to think they will recognise the value of the hospitality sector and recognise that if they give us a break through business rates reform, a reduction in employer national insurance contributions, speed up the planning process, and ideally bring VAT in line with Europe, then the sector will thrive, investing as it does so and creating jobs.\n\n\n\nGetting some stability and certainty can only help, so settling the election early has been a positive outcome.\n\nPaul Thwaite, CEO of NatWest Group\n\nView image in fullscreen Paul Thwaite\n\nGrowing our economy to help increase prosperity and raise the living standards of people across the UK is, rightly, a priority for our new government. The financial services sector will be a crucial partner if we are to achieve this shared ambition.\n\nWe welcome the government\u2019s commitment to work with the private sector through long-term policies such as the National Wealth Fund and a modern industrial strategy.\n\nTo support our economy, we also need a competitive banking sector. We have a strong track record of high regulatory standards and consumer protections, and this must continue. However, I believe there are practical reforms in areas like fraud, competitiveness and regulation that would better enable banks to support customers and promote investment.\n\nI look forward to working with the government and across industries to make meaningful progress on critical issues that will help to create jobs and prosperity in every region and nation of the UK.",

    "body": "The labor market started to ease in June, with 206,000 jobs added to the US economy last month, according to new labor data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nThe number of new jobs is close to what economists had expected for the month. The figures represent a slight cooling compared to May, when the economy added a revised 218,000 jobs.\n\nThe unemployment rate in June was 4.1%, a 0.1% increase compared with May and the first time the rate has been above 4% in over two years.\n\nData released earlier this week suggested the labor market was starting to cool. Payroll firm ADP reported that private employers added 150,000 jobs in June, down from 157,000 in May. Job losses also appear to be growing. Executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas reported 48,786 job cuts in June, down from 63,816 cuts in May but still a nearly 20% increase compared with June of last year.\n\nThe jobs figures, released on the first Friday of every month, have been closely watched by Wall Street, which is eager to see interest rates drop, and in Washington, where the strength of hiring has been one of the few bright spots for the Biden administration, which is struggling with poor polling on its economic policies.\n\nAlong with inflation figures, which come out later in the month, the Federal Reserve uses jobs figures to determine whether the economy is cooling and ready for interest rates to drop.\n\nLast month, officials at the Fed kept rates at a two-decade high of around 5.3%, where it has been for nearly a year. The Fed has been trying to bring inflation down to 2%. In May, inflation sat at 3.4% \u2013 lower than its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but still higher than the Fed\u2019s target rate.\n\nMinutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting were released on Wednesday and showed the central bank was waiting for \u201cadditional favorable data\u201d before making cuts.\n\nBut in bringing inflation down, the Fed must make sure the labor market is not cooling too much. Earlier this week, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said at an event that the economy has \u201cmade a lot of progress\u201d and has \u201cseen a pretty substantial move toward better balance\u201d in the labor market.\n\n\u201cWe want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down. We want to understand that the levels that we\u2019re seeing are a true reading on what is actually happening with underlying inflation,\u201d Powell said.\n\nInflation figures for June will be released on 11 July. The Fed\u2019s next meeting is on 30 and 31 July.",

    "body": "Shares rose a bit. The pound barely budged on the currency markets. There was no shortage of demand for UK government bonds. A dramatic night in politics left the City relatively unmoved.\n\nThere were three big reasons for that. The first was that a thumping Labour victory had been expected for months. It was, in the parlance of financial markets, fully priced in. A hung parliament would have been a different story but there was never any real prospect of that, and once the results of the exit poll were announced the result was not in doubt. International investors are far more worried about what might happen in the second round of the French elections on Sunday than they were about the outcome in the UK.\n\nThe second reason there was only the slightest of reaction to the biggest Conservative defeat in history is that the markets think little will change. The small opening rise in the FTSE 100 index of leading London shares was led by housebuilders in anticipation of changes to planning law but Labour\u2019s economic plans are modest and cautious. It has ruled out big increases in spending and taxes and will be subject to rules governing how much it can borrow.\n\nThis is neither 1945, when a Labour government came to power on a radical socialist manifesto, nor 2017, when a victory for Jeremy Corbyn certainly would have caused a stir in the markets. Rachel Reeves has spent a lot of time convincing the City that she will be a safe pair of hands as chancellor and it has paid off.\n\nThe final reason for the serene response in the markets to Labour\u2019s win is the belief that the worst is over for the economy. A global pandemic and the energy crisis prompted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine have meant the period since 2019 has been something of an economic horror show.\n\nThe Conservatives have been severely punished for presiding over the highest inflation in 40 years, the higher mortgage rates that resulted from Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous premiership, and for living standards being lower at the end of the last parliament than they were at its start. Without question, the election was a rejection of the Conservatives rather than a strong endorsement for Labour.\n\nThe scars from the coronavirus pandemic have not yet fully healed but the impact of the cost of living crisis is fading. Growth is picking up and inflation is back to its 2% target. Real incomes are rising and the Bank of England will soon start to cut interest rates, perhaps as early as next month.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "body": "2d ago 17.35 CEST The Invest in Women Taskforce has welcomed the appointment of Rachel Reeves as the first female chancellor, which she co-chairs. Fellow co-chair Debbie Wosskow said: A female chancellor, one of the highest offices in the country, who has already vowed to put women at the heart of economic plans, is so vital. A female chancellor who also recognises the billions that female entrepreneurs could add to Britain\u2019s economy is even better. Reeves has already vowed to close the gender pay gap once and for all, and to make flexible working the norm. These are structural drivers of inequality that should be addressed at a policy level and will play an integral part in allowing women to embrace entrepreneurship. For the most effective change, though, we need to enable a new era of public and private sector collaboration. Just 2% of capital investment goes into all-female founded teams in the UK, and we need to break this decades-long cycle. This is exactly what the taskforce exists to do and, by working with the new chancellor, we will make great strides this year and put the UK on the map for female entrepreneurs. Share\n\n2d ago 17.29 CEST Jasper Jolly Former Nissan and Aston Martin executive Andy Palmer has said that the Labour party could signal a new phase for the UK automotive industry. Palmer was chief operating officer at Japanese carmaker Nissan, bringing mass manufacturing of electric cars to the UK for the first time. He then led British sportscar maker Aston Martin until 2020. He said he hoped a stable government could attract more inward investment from major companies to build in the UK. He said: I\u2019m no politician, but I am an auto guy, an industry guy. What I saw over the last five years was a disengagement with industry and business. I woke up today with probably a greater sense of optimism for an awful long time, at least in that I\u2019m pretty sure the Labour party will listen to autos and business. Palmer said he believed that the UK needs more battery manufacturing. He is now chair of a Slovakian battery company, Inobat, which could potentially benefit from government support if it were to invest in the UK. We\u2019ve fallen behind dramatically in that green revolution. We need to grasp it. Share Updated at 17.30 CEST\n\n2d ago 17.02 CEST Reeves has a tough task on her hands. Andrew Hunter, a senior economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the Labour may soon have to choose between higher taxes, higher borrowing or spending cuts. The new Labour government has an historically strong electoral mandate, but will still need to tread a fine line between enacting the required spending and reforms to improve public services and revitalise the economy, and maintaining the confidence of financial markets. Moreover, these challenges come at a time when the economy already faces a variety of other risks, including from geopolitical tensions or the possibility that persistent inflation could warrant interest rates staying high for longer than currently assumed. Attracting sufficient levels of private-sector capital through their green investment plans will likely to be key to Labour\u2019s hopes for a sustained resurgence in economic growth. But, while there is an upside risk that this succeeds and helps drive a sustained improvement in the economy\u2019s supply side performance over the coming years, it is not our current baseline forecast.

Will it work? Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange, an alternative stock exchange focused on smaller companies, said: The first thing they\u2019ve got to do is gain the confidence of the City. The first 100 days is really going to matter. Reeves has \u201cdone a good job so far\u201d of reassuring the City with her pitch of stability, said Haynes. However, he said he wanted the government to offer more help to growing companies, and incentives to keep them in the UK rather than going elsewhere. He would particularly like the extension of the enterprise investment scheme, a tax break for investors, to companies that are growing quickly (including many that are listed on his exchange). However, Haynes is sceptical about plans to raise taxes that would hit some of the City\u2019s wealthiest, such as abolishing a loophole that allows private equity bosses to pay capital gains tax on earnings rather than higher income tax, abolishing the tax break for non-domiciled people, and taxing private schools. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help when you read things in the Guardian about putting up capital gains tax,\u201d said Haynes. \u201cThat kills entrepreneurship. That\u2019s just total madness.\u201d View image in fullscreen City workers in Paternoster Square, where the headquarters of the London Stock Exchange Group is based, in the City of London, UK. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Share\n\n2d ago 15.03 CEST Mark Mullen, chief executive at Atom Bank, said: There are clear similarities between running a business and running an economy. When revenues stagnate, cost cutting takes over. For years now it feels like we\u2019ve been trying to shrink to greatness and it\u2019s time to change course. We urgently need to invest. In our public services, in infrastructure, in our schools and universities and in housing. Our new government must foster productivity, encouraging regulators to facilitate real competition and holding businesses to account for their failures. It must encourage banks to support SMEs and drive out complacency about falling service standards. Real competition leads to better customer outcomes. When it comes to employee welfare, companies should be encouraged to follow the data and not the dogma. Happy and healthy colleagues are good for business. And our path to net zero can either be a burden or an opportunity. We should make it the latter and incentivise companies to invest in renewables and in a sustainable future. A new government and prime minister offers us a rare opportunity to re-boot UK plc. We must seize it with both hands. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of insurance marketplace Lloyd\u2019s, said: Lloyd\u2019s looks forward to partnering with the new UK Government to generate growth and to build resilience into our economy. Our role is to provide critical solutions to support disaster resilience, insuring the transition and bringing global investment to the UK. We look to the government to bring a period of greater stability and to enact reforms necessary to improve the economy\u2019s competitiveness.

Bosses in the financial sector have called on the new Labour government to boost investment and increase productivity after the sweeping win under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, write Kalyeena Makortoff and Jasper Jolly. The financial industry is one of the UK\u2019s key sectors, accounting for about one in every 12 pounds generated by the British economy. Labour described financial services in its manifesto as \u201cone of Britain\u2019s greatest success stories\u201d, and has pledged to bring forward public-private partnerships to fund investments in infrastructure. Here is what some of the City\u2019s bosses had to say. Andrea Rossi, chief executive of investment manager M&G, said: With over 12 million people in the UK seeking assistance to achieve financial security and the UK\u2019s financial advice gap widening (only 9% of Brits currently have access to advice), we would want to see any new government implementing policies that encourage long term savings and support better retirement outcomes. There is currently an acute set of societal challenges and barriers to saving for many, with the cost-of-living crisis drastically reducing disposable incomes. We\u2019d look to work with the next government and the wider financial services industry to provide more opportunity for savers to benefit from financial products that meet their investment needs. As a member of Labour\u2019s British Infrastructure Council I look forward to working with the government to unlock private investment to boost infrastructure investment in the UK. Private-public investment initiatives will be key in getting capital to sustainable British real estate and infrastructure projects that can position the UK for sustainable growth. Share Updated at 15.04 CEST\n\n2d ago 14.55 CEST Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist, said despite June\u2019s forecast-beating 206,000 gain in non-farm payrolls, overall this was a \u201cdisappointing\u201d report given the total 111,000 downward revisions to past months and the further rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, \u201cwhich puts us one step closer to triggering the Sahm rule on recessions\u201d. That 206,000 gain was also not nearly as good as it looks at first glance, with 70,000 coming from government jobs. Of the 136,00 increase in private payrolls, health care and social assistance accounted for 82,000 of those additional jobs. That suggests cyclical employment increased by only around 50,000, adding to the evidence of weakness in GDP growth, he said. Admittedly, the rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, from 4.0%, was for the \u201cright\u201d reasons, with a 277,000 increase in the labour force eclipsing a muted 116,000 increase in the household survey measure of employment. That means we\u2019re getting closer to triggering the so-called Sahm rule, although since the rate is being driven up mainly by strong labour supply rather than weak labour demand, we would caution against relying on it too heavily in what has been a unique cycle in many respects. Share Updated at 14.58 CEST\n\n2d ago 14.44 CEST The 206,000 increase in employment in June was similar to the average monthly gain of 220,000 over the past year, the bureau said. Government employment rose by 70,000 in June, higher than the average monthly gain of 49,000 over the past 12 months. Healthcare added 49,000 jobs, lower than the average monthly gain of 64,000 over the prior 12 months. Employment in social assistance increased by 34,000 in June, primarily in individual and family services (+26,000). Construction added 27,000 jobs in June, higher than the average monthly gain of 20,000 over the past year.

    "title": "Key economic challenges facing Labour and Britain's first female chancellor",
    "body": "A range of thorny issues are stacked in the in-tray of the incoming government as it sets about boosting growth without breaking campaign pledges not to increase debt or raise taxes.\n\nRachel Reeves will have to wrestle with a tough economic inheritance. Pic: Reuters\n\nHaving turned the political map red, Labour's priority is steering the economy into the black.\n\nSir Keir Starmer's programme for government may be modest, but the means to deliver it are not.\n\nThe new prime minister and Rachel Reeves - the UK's first female chancellor - have a tough economic inheritance.\n\nFollow general election fallout live\n\nStagnant growth, hefty debt interest payments and an ageing, sickly population have left public services stretched.\n\nIf they are to revive them without breaking campaign pledges not to increase debt or raise taxes, everything rests on delivering growth.\n\nThe early indications from the financial markets was positive.\n\nBarely two years after Liz Truss's mini-budget sent the pound crashing and the cost of borrowing soaring, there was no similar drama to greet Sir Keir.\n\nBoth sterling and 10-year gilts were stable and the FTSE 100 index moved upwards, driven by housebuilders and lenders, an acknowledgment of Labour's plans to promote housebuilding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKallum Pickering, chief economist at investment bank Peel Hunt, said \"With this big majority early on, Sir Keir Starmer has momentum. So what does he do with it?\n\n\"There's too much debt to be lowering taxes or boosting spending. Those days are gone.\n\n\"So he'll probably use this for regulatory reform, the things that will be positive, like housing market reforms.\"\n\nHow to watch and follow the election All the information you need to see the results come in, wherever or however you like. Tap here\n\nThe FTSE 250, comprised of more British companies, also rose more than 1% in the first hour, a vote of confidence perhaps that Labour's promise of stability, the quality prized above all, will be delivered.\n\nSir Keir and Ms Reeves promise to stimulate growth but it will take the private sector, and the investors on whose confidence the UK relies, to deliver it.\n\nHow effective those plans are, and how new ministers handle a challenging in-tray and the inevitable unknowns, will shape the administration.\n\nTop of the list is planning reform, intended to accelerate housing and energy infrastructure, rewriting rules and reclassifying green belt to deliver homes in the face of inevitable local opposition.\n\nBarriers to onshore wind, moribund for a decade under the Conservatives, and solar energy, attractive to farmers but not their neighbours, will be removed, and the national grid will expanded and upgraded.\n\nThat should be good news for companies like Octopus, Britain's largest retail energy provider with ambitions to become a major generator if renewable projects become easier to deliver.\n\nFounder and chief executive Greg Jackson has welcomed Labour's commitment to the sector, which contrasted with Rishi Sunak's recent net-zero scepticism.\n\n\"I hope that what we've now got is the stability that we can invest in delivering a cheaper green electricity system,\" he told Sky News.\n\nRead more:\n\nLabour have won - but what happens next?\n\nLabour's journey back to power\n\nThe Tory story since 2010 in big pictures\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:32 Starmer: 'Change begins now'\n\nMr Jackson has specific demands.\n\nHe wants planning simplified - projects can currently take 13 years to get connected to the grid - market reform so local people benefit from local renewables, and a push to electrification.\n\nLabour will bring forward the phase out of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030, reversing Mr Sunak's delay to 2035.\n\n\"The big message for me is that voters have rejected going back to the world of fossil fuels and oil and gas. All of the research tells us that voters know that wind and solar are the cheaper, more secure, more reliable sources of electricity that we need,\" he said.\n\n\"Britain can really be a proud leader in this transition and that's going to be great for jobs.\n\n\"The countries that lead this way are the ones that are going to be most prosperous, and I really hope that that's where we're going to be now.\"\n\nWhile the oil and gas industry will baulk at an increase to the windfall tax and a ban on new North Sea licences, elsewhere Labour's approach has been largely welcomed by a business community bruised by Brexit.\n\nImproving the relationship with the EU is higher on business's radar than it seems to be on Labour's.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:32 Who is new PM Sir Keir Starmer?\n\nA return to the single market and free movement, a shortcut to growth, has been ruled politically and practically impossible in the short term, but Sir Keir and his team have talked about a warmer relationship with Brussels and improving the terms of the current deal.\n\nThree years after implementation, the negative impact on British companies trading with Europe is unarguable, with companies large and small no longer coy about mentioning it.\n\nSocrates Camenon founded his food processing and distribution company Golden Delight Foods in the 1980s, trading routinely with Greece and other European countries until Brexit.\n\n\"It has had a devastating impact,\" he said.\n\n\"We've lost all our exports, we're having continual problems of shortages of product, prices are increasing, and the difficulties in admin and paperwork is mind boggling.\n\n\"The red tape has created a nightmare.\n\n\"If a businessman makes a mistake he has to do a U-turn.\n\n\"We've made a mistake, we've got to go back there and re-negotiate.\n\n\"We knew the Europeans weren't going to make it easy for us, they had to make an example of us to set an example to 27 other states.\n\n\"But we've been the people who've been taken the pain.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:34 How election night unfolded\n\nCutting international red tape will be welcomed, but Labour's plans to impose domestic bureaucracy, in the form of employment reforms, has caused significant anxiety.\n\nThe \"new deal for working people\" has been downgraded from hard policy to a consultation, but it remains core to Labour's offer to voters.\n\nMeasures include the promise of \"day one employment rights\", including the right to parental leave and sick pay, ending \"exploitative\" zero hours contracts, and closing the ethnicity and disability pay gap.\n\nWith the living wage also rising, these are potential costs felt most keenly by small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe prospect of Ms Reeves equalising capital gains tax is also exercising some, a move that would end the unfairness of those who disguise income as capital gains paying less tax than workers, but could deter wealth creators whom it incentivises to take risks.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:47 Sunak resigns, saying 'I'm sorry'\n\nThe economic weather may bring some cheer, with inflation stabilising close to 2% and interest rates likely to fall next month, passing on a little respite to households and cheering markets.\n\nBut Ms Reeves and the new business secretary - Jonathan Reynolds has shadowed the role for more than two years - are unlikely to have the luxury of basking in it.\n\nThe in-tray is already full of thorny challenges, top of the pile Thames Water's debt crisis and the prospect of special administration, effectively nationalisation.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nThames' annual results will be published next Tuesday - and 48 hours later, regulator Ofwat will announce what it, and every other water company, can charge their customers in future, with steep increases guaranteed.\n\nIf Thames Water remains in its chief executive's words \"uninvestable\", the new government may have no choice but to trigger an administration that would be expensive and possibly open-ended.\n\nHow that is handled, and the outcome for Thames' shareholders and lenders, will have consequences for how the UK is viewed by the global investors Labour is relying on to fund the energy transition and beyond.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nOne nationalisation Labour are committed to is rail, albeit in stages as private contracts expire, and the business department will have to sign off the controversial foreign takeover of Royal Mail's parent company.\n\nAlso pressing will be a deal with Tata over the future of its Port Talbot works, a decision with far more baggage for Labour than the outgoing administration.",

But inflation is now cooling markedly, and keeping the job market strong has once again become a big priority for central bankers.\n\nThat is why the jobs report on Friday could be a cautionary moment.\n\nUnemployment has been ticking steadily higher over the past year: June\u2019s 4.1 percent reading was up from 3.6 percent a year earlier.

    "title": "The first vaccine for malaria received major regulatory approval in 2015.",
    "body": "The first vaccine for malaria received major regulatory approval in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t become part of vaccination programs in Africa until 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if it had come faster?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if the shots had arrived\n\n9 years ago?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n143,000.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s how many children\u2019s deaths could have been averted.\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 5, 2024\n\n\n\nNurses in countries from Sierra Leone to Cameroon are packing a new vaccine into the coolers they tote to villages for immunization clinics: a shot to protect against malaria, one of the deadliest diseases for children.\n\n\n\nBabies and toddlers in eight countries in the region recently started to get the vaccine as part of their routine childhood shots. Seven other African countries are eagerly awaiting its arrival.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a milestone in global health.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a cautionary tale about a system that is ill equipped to deliver critical tools to the people who need them most. It took decades and at least a billion dollars to reach this point. Even now, only a fraction of the children whose lives are at risk will get the vaccine this year, or next year, or the year after. It\u2019s been clear for some time what went wrong, but almost none of those issues have been fixed. That means that the next desperately needed vaccine stands every chance of running into those same problems. Take, for example, a new vaccine for tuberculosis that started clinical trials a few months ago. If it works as well as hoped, it could save at least a million lives a year. We\u2019ll know by 2028 if it stops tuberculosis infections. But if it follows the same trajectory, it will be at least 2038 before it\u2019s shipped to clinics.\n\n\u201cChildren are receiving the vaccine, and for that, I am the happiest man in the world. But on the other hand, I cannot avoid being dismayed at this inexcusably long delay.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dr. Joe Cohen, co-inventor of the first malaria vaccine\n\nThe U.S. Army started work on a malaria vaccine back in the 1980s, hoping to protect soldiers deployed to the tropics. It teamed up with the drug company GlaxoSmithKline, and together they produced promising prototypes. But the military lost interest after a few years, and that left GSK with a problem. The people who desperately needed a malaria vaccine were in villages in sub-Saharan Africa. They would not be able to pay for a product that would cost millions of dollars to develop. GSK needed an altruistically minded partner. It found one in the nonprofit global health agency PATH, and by the late 1990s they had a vaccine to test. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation put up more than $200 million to test it. The clinical trials were complex, because this was a whole new type of vaccine \u2014 the first ever against a parasite \u2014 delivered to children in places with limited health systems. The process took more than a decade. Finally, in 2014, results showed this vaccine cut severe malaria cases by about a third. This was a successful result, but not as much protection as scientists had hoped to see. Still, GSK and PATH planned a production facility to make millions of doses. Gavi, the organization that procures vaccines for low- and middle-income countries, with funds from donors, would buy them.\n\nThen the Gates Foundation pulled its support.\n\nThere was a shake-up in the malaria division, and the leadership reoriented toward a new goal: eliminating the disease. The new malaria team said the vaccine didn\u2019t work well enough to justify pouring millions more dollars into it. It would be better, they said, to wait for a more effective shot in the future, and in the meantime to fund other strategies, such as genetically modifying mosquitoes.\n\n\u201cIf you go from very enthusiastic to very unenthusiastic and you\u2019re the Gates Foundation, people pay attention.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dr. Robert Newman, former director, Global Malaria Program, W.H.O.\n\nThe decision was driven by researchers who were looking at data. They didn\u2019t factor in that the idea of a vaccine, even one with limited efficacy, would be so important to African parents \u2014 and African governments, which would come to see this as a classic example of a paternalistic donor ignoring their priorities. More than 300,000 children died of malaria that year. The foundation\u2019s announcement shoved the vaccine into limbo \u2014 in ways the foundation today says it did not anticipate.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, we could have communicated more often and more clearly about our decisions and listened more clearly to what the impact of those might have been on other institutions and their decisions.\u201d",

    "body": "In today's economy, understanding where your income places you on the socioeconomic ladder is crucial. The lines between income classes can seem blurred, but recent data clarifies income distribution in the United States.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare ?\n\nAre you rich? Here\u2019s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, the median income of middle-class households increased from about $66,400 in 1970 to $106,100 in 2022, reflecting a 60% increase. In the same period, upper-income households saw a 78% rise in median income, from about $144,100 to $256,900. These figures, scaled to a three-person household and adjusted for 2023 dollars, illustrate a growing disparity between income classes.\n\nLower-income households have experienced slower growth, with median income increasing by only 55%, from about $22,800 in 1970 to $35,300 in 2022. This slower growth has widened the income gap significantly. In 2022, the median income of upper-income households was 7.3 times that of lower-income households, compared to 6.3 times in 1970. For middle-income households, the ratio was 2.4 times in 2022, up from 2.2 in 1970.\n\nDemographics also play a role in income distribution. Children and adults over 65 are more likely to live in lower-income households. In 2022, 38% of children and 35% of adults 65 and older fell into this category, compared to 26% of adults aged 30 to 44 and 23% of those aged 45 to 64. Conversely, adults in their prime working years (30 to 64) were more likely to be in the upper-income bracket. The share of people living in upper-income households ranged from 13% among younger adults to 24% among those aged 45 to 64.\n\nGender differences are also evident. In 2022, men were slightly more likely than women to live in middle-income households (53% vs. 51%) and were more likely to be in upper-income households (18% vs. 16%).\n\nIn 2023, Fool.com offered a detailed breakdown of income classifications, providing insight into where different income levels stand, even within the middle class.\n\nMiddle class includes those in the 40th to 60th percentile of household income, with an income range of $55,001 to $89,744.\n\nUpper middle class covers the 60th to 80th percentile, with incomes between $89,745 and $149,131.\n\nUpper class comprises the top 20% of earners, with incomes of $149,132 or higher.\n\nTrending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nConsider these figures when evaluating your own income status. Remember, this is just a snapshot in time \u2014 your earnings and class designation can change throughout your life.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet worth disparities further highlight the income divide. While the median net worth of upper-class households (income $149,132 or higher) is $805,400, those in the lower class have a median net worth of just $12,000.\n\nUnderstanding where your income places can provide valuable insight into your financial health and future prospects.

    "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks Under $20 per Share",
    "body": "A low stock price isn't always bad -- it's like a clearance sale at your favorite store.\n\nJust because a stock is cheap doesn't mean it's a dud. Sometimes, the company had a rough quarter, or maybe there's a market panic unrelated to its performance. In some cases, the long-term opportunities in front of a small company aren't recognized by Wall Street. For savvy investors, a low stock price can be a chance to buy a solid company at a discount.\n\nSo, while others run away, you could score a great deal. Remember, it's about buying low and selling high, not following the crowd. On that note, here are two top tech stocks with really low share prices.\n\nBoth stocks are, in fact, strong plays on the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Grabbing a few of these cheap shares today should serve you well in the long haul -- and the stubs are really affordable.\n\nSoundHound AI: $3.93 per share\n\nAI-powered voice control expert SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has had its ups and downs recently, but the company's long-term potential remains promising. Specializing in voice AI and conversational intelligence technologies, this little company is positioned to thrive as demand grows for these services.\n\nThere's a lot to be optimistic about here. The company has a significant backlog of long-term contracts worth $682 million, which provides a clear path to future revenue. If you overlook this crucial metric, SoundHound AI looks quite expensive in light of just $50.8 million in trailing sales. That would be a mistake in the long run.\n\nAdditionally, strategic moves such as paying off its long-term debt and acquiring key assets from the online ordering platform Allset demonstrate SoundHound AI's commitment to growth and innovation. And don't forget that the backlog is growing by leaps and bounds. The first-quarter figure stood 80% above the year-ago period's reading. In other words, SoundHound AI has set up a robust and growing portfolio of long-term contracts that will convert into real revenue streams over the next few years.\n\nWith a solid cash reserve of $180 million and no debt, SoundHound AI is well prepared to seize new opportunities. The company is not yet profitable and its valuation ratios may seem high, but that enormous (and soaring) order backlog and a string of strategic initiatives suggest a bright future. At just $3.93 per share, SoundHound AI offers a compelling investment opportunity if you're willing to take a chance on this innovative AI player.\n\nUiPath: $12.96 per share\n\nRobotic process automation (RPA) specialist UiPath (NYSE: PATH) has had a tough year, with its stock down 48% in 2024. Despite this negative Wall Street sentiment, the company remains a key player in RPA, integrating AI technologies into its service offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nRPA is software technology that automates repetitive and routine tasks usually performed by humans, improving efficiency and accuracy. Despite the name, it rarely involves actual robots. While not strictly an AI company, UiPath uses AI to boost its software capabilities, such as mining data and understanding legal documents.\n\nThe recent plunge in UiPath's stock price largely stemmed from a mixed first-quarter earnings report. While earnings and revenue came in above the consensus analyst targets, the company's annualized renewal run rate (ARR) hit the low end of its guidance at $1.51 billion. Moreover, UiPath slashed its full-year ARR forecast from $1.73 billion to $1.66 billion. That's a bad reading on the automation expert's contracts-based recurring revenue flows.\n\nThe unexpected resignation of CEO Rob Enslin, who was replaced by co-founder Daniel Dines, further unsettled investors, leading to a 34% single-day drop in the stock price. C-suite shake-ups are rarely good news, though I don't mind a company founder getting his hands back on the steering wheel.\n\nHowever, the sell-off looks overdone. UiPath's long-term prospects remain strong, with the global RPA market expected to grow from $3 billion in 2023 to $31 billion by 2030. UiPath is well positioned to capture a significant share of this expanding market, starting from just $1.35 billion in trailing revenue. As you can tell from UiPath's 45% share of the RPA market's current revenue opportunity, I'm talking about an established leader in this booming industry.\n\nUiPath's fundamentals are sound. The company boasts a robust cash reserve of $1.9 billion with no debt, allowing management to make strategic investments or acquisitions to accelerate top-line growth. Additionally, its free cash flow jumped 39% year over year to $101.3 million in Q1 2024. UiPath is making cash profits by the digital truckload.\n\nGiven the current low valuation and the significant market opportunity, UiPath presents a compelling investment opportunity. For investors willing to absorb some volatility at first, the potential for long-term gains makes UiPath a tech stock worth considering today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

    "title": "Rachel Reeves: Who is the UK's new chancellor?",
    "body": "Rachel Reeves: Who is the UK's new chancellor?\n\n2 days ago By Lora Jones , Business reporter, BBC News Share\n\nReuters\n\n\"Serious\" and \"determined\" are words often used to describe Rachel Reeves, the former Bank of England economist who has become the UK's first female chancellor. But colleagues and friends have suggested that her public persona does not reflect her human side, with a loud laugh and deep love of Beyonc\u00e9 tracks. In her maiden speech in the House of Commons in 2010, she vowed to fight for \"jobs, growth and prosperity\" - all of which form the central pillar of Labour's economic plans as it enters government. So who exactly is Rachel Reeves, and how might she address the challenges ahead?\n\nReeves was born in south-east London in 1979, just a few months before Margaret Thatcher became prime minister at a time of immense social and economic change. Her parents were both teachers and have described her as an adventurous child who might venture to the edge of a path when on a walk near the seaside. She previously told the BBC that her mum would tick off items on a bank statement against receipts while sitting at the kitchen table: \"We weren't poor, but we didn't have money to waste.\" Her parents separated when she was at primary school and she and her sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes. During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering. They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives' houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all of her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money. Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and has very much modelled herself on Gordon Brown\u2019s \u201cprudence\u201d in the lead-up to Labour\u2019s 1997 election win.\n\nChess champion\n\nReeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. By the time she was in secondary school, she was a national champion, and would \"quietly thrash\" any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie. A keen flute player, she took her music GCSE a year early at Beckenham's Cator Park School for Girls, a comprehensive school, and would go on to gain four A-levels. Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of \"two pre-fab huts in the playground\", she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 17, Reeves joined the Labour Party. She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student Reeves would host others before college discos, blasting Destiny's Child songs and dressing up in her room.\n\nRachel Reeves: The basics\n\nAge: 45 Place of birth: Lewisham, south-east London Education: New College, Oxford and the London School of Economics Family: Married to Nicholas Joicey, a senior civil servant and former speechwriter to Gordon Brown during his time as chancellor. They have two children. Her sister is Labour MP Ellie Reeves. Parliamentary constituency: Leeds West and Pudsey\n\nPA Rachel Reeves with her sister Ellie Reeves, who is also a Labour MP\n\nAfter graduating, she took on a role as an economist at the Bank of England. She worked on the central bank's Japan desk, looking at the country's attempts to come out of stagnation in the 1990s. During a secondment to the UK's embassy in Washington DC, she met her future husband Nicholas Joicey, who had spent time as a film critic for newspapers and as a speechwriter to then-Chancellor Gordon Brown. The path to Parliament was not clear for Reeves though. There were two failed campaigns for the former seat of Bromley and Chislehurst, typically a safe one for the Conservatives. Before becoming an MP for Leeds West in 2010, she moved to Leeds and spent time working at the Halifax Bank of Scotland. On entering Parliament, she rose quickly up the ranks. She was awarded a number of key shadow roles and, according to political columnist Rachel Sylvester, was \"seen from the start as someone to be promoted\". One colleague said that she \"chews through calls and briefings\", before adding, \"I have never, ever, ever, seen her unprepared.\" Last December, Reeves spoke at the funeral of Alistair Darling, the former chancellor who served as a mentor when she was starting out. She spoke fondly of having lasagne and red wine with him and his wife, and of his counsel - he found himself in charge during a massive crisis when families and the country were having a hard time making ends meet.\n\nCriticisms\n\nWhile one of her friends has said she is politically \"as hard as nails\", her time in Westminster has not been without controversy. She has been accused of \"utter hypocrisy\" in the past for only offering students payments for expenses, rather than a full salary, while working in her office. Under Jeremy Corbyn, she spent time on the backbenches of the Commons because she felt she could not endorse his policies. Called a \"Red Tory\" by others in the party, she described this as a \"very unpleasant period\" in an interview with the BBC's Nick Robinson. The former editor of the BBC's Newsnight programme was also forced to issue a written apology to Reeves after calling her \"boring snoring\" on social media in a post that was meant to be a private message. While she has said the incident was \"deeply humiliating\", her key aim during her time as shadow chancellor focused on portraying Labour as a steady economic hand and in her new role will continue to do so.\n\nGetty Images Rachel Reeves served as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury under Ed Balls (right), pictured in 2012\n\nReeves has said herself, however, that the party will inherit the worst economic situation since the aftermath of World War Two. She has pledged to accept the same fiscal rules that were used by the Conservatives: that the government should not borrow any more cash for day-to-day spending and to show that it is getting the country's debt down within five years. In the run-up to the general election, the party set out plans for a National Wealth Fund, which would see a Labour government stump up \u00a37bn to encourage private investment in green sectors, boosting productivity and the economy in turn. For Reeves and her staff, it is part of a big push to engage business in what has been dubbed a \"smoked salmon and scrambled egg\" offensive of breakfast meetings with senior business leaders. At the end of these meetings, whenever lavish pastries are left over, Reeves has admitted her team will ask permission from the hosts to take the leftovers back to their colleagues at the office. Living out her \"no waste\" values in practice may prove to be more challenging now she has taken office and the full extent of the challenges ahead become clear.",

    "title": "UK economy: Labour must take action now",
    "body": "Labour must act now to reboot the economy\n\n2 days ago By Faisal Islam , @faisalislam, Economics editor Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nLabour\u2019s remarkable landslide provides a one-off opportunity to reboot and transform the British economy. The incoming chancellor and prime minister know this, and I have been told that it is what they intend to achieve in office. Rachel Reeves told me she was seeking a \u201cmandate for growth\u201d. They believe that they have won this election with a message of political and economic stability after years of chaos. Liz Truss\u2019 mini-budget loomed large in the minds of key swing voters, who got their feet on the property ladder in the period of near-zero interest rates, and voted for the Conservatives under former Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nThose newbuild housing estates, in every constituency - \u201cBarratt Home Britain\u201d - turned red. This underpins the incoming chancellor\u2019s \u201ciron clad\u201d commitment to keep borrowing, and interest rates, under control. \u201cStability first\u201d is the mantra. But they have also privately been told by former Downing Street residents and by some captains of industry that \u201cstability, while welcome, is not enough\u201d.\n\nWhile the Labour manifesto set out a mission and very broad strategy behind a stronger economy, it was not a detailed transformative plan. For example, public net investment is still set to be cut from current levels. The big criticism of Ms Reeves' vision of what she calls \u201csecurinomics\u201d - a new model of economics where the government does more to prepare for the private sector to make massive investments in green industry - was a lack of money. It is an attempt to emulate what US President Joe Biden is doing by investing by spending billions in new subsidies via loans and tax breaks targeted at green energy and vehicles. Labour's plan is basically \"Bidenomics without the cash\", critics say. But Labour leaders have been reassured that there is a tidal wave of private investment - hundreds of billions by the end of the parliament - waiting to be made, if there is political, economic and policy certainty. But they need to act with speed to secure it. Some key investors say they cannot wait another year for ponderous reviews of planning or energy policy, for example. Tens of billions in renewable investment, for example, is held up in planning disputes and a decade-long wait for a connection to the National Grid. This, Ms Reeves told me, had led to \u201can effective moratorium on building the cheapest forms of energy\u201d.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBut there is some intrigue as to whether in government, Sir Keir Starmer and Ms Reeves will now boldly face down opposition, on house building or key net zero transition measures. If it\u2019s going to work in transforming the economy quickly, it\u2019s going to have to hurt some people. There are a number of immediate challenges in the public finances. Further bankruptcies of councils and universities need to be dealt with. Shadow ministers report being staggered by the number of working families who are distraught about provision of special needs education, which has suffered from council cuts. While Labour ruled out raising the main rates of tax, there are other taxes that could rise in an Autumn Budget. The work on that and a spending review will start very quickly. More happily for many consumers and the public finances, the Bank of England could finally start to cut rates on 1 August. An imaginative approach to strict public finance rules that allowed more upfront useful investment could prove irresistible.",

    "body": "Shares in housebuilders rise on back of Labour win\n\n2 days ago By Lora Jones and Chris Newlands , Business reporters Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe share prices of UK housebuilders jumped on Friday after Labour's landslide victory in the general election saw the party return to power for the first time since 2010. Vistry, Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Berkeley all finished the day between 2-3% higher on the back of Labour\u2019s plans to build new homes. During the election campaign, Labour focused largely on tackling housing supply, with a promise to build 1.5 million homes over the next parliament. The party has pledged to reform the planning system, although some have warned that doing so will not be easy.\n\nWill the walk match the talk?\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, new Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that planning reform was \"front and centre\" of Labour's plan to grow the economy. In order to build the 1.5 million homes and the energy infrastructure that Labour has committed to, \"we need to change how our planning system works - speed it up, stop the bureaucracies that are tying up investments in red tape,\" she said. Labour has also said it will allow development on lower-quality areas in the green belt, dubbed the \"grey belt\". Analysts RBC Capital Markets said in a note that they would be watching to see if the new government's \"walk matches its talk\". \"In the very short term we suspect that the talk alone will be enough to lift share prices,\" RBC said. However, Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said overhauling the planning system is likely to be a \"gradual and tortuous process\". The share price rise comes as the UK's biggest mortgage lender Halifax said mortgage costs are still the biggest challenge facing homebuyers and those coming to the end of fixed-term deals However, the squeeze caused by higher interest rates is likely to ease gradually as incomes rise and house price growth remains subdued, said Amanda Bryden, the head of mortgages at Halifax. According to the lender's latest figures, the average UK house price was relatively flat in June, falling by 0.2% from the previous month. The average house price in the UK stood at \u00a3288,455 last month, the Halifax said, edging down from \u00a3288,931 in May. Prices were up 1.6% from a year earlier, echoing recent figures from the Nationwide building society. Ms Bryden said, however, the market was \"delicately balanced\" and sensitive to how quickly any changes may be made to the Bank of England's base rate.\n\n'Tepid' market",

    "title": "Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?",
    "body": "Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?\n\n2 days ago By Tom Singleton , Technology reporter Share\n\nAmazon\n\nThree decades on from the day it began, it is hard to get your head around the scale of Amazon. Consider its vast warehouse in Dartford, on the outskirts of London. It has millions of stock items, with hundreds of thousands of them bought every day - and it takes two hours from the moment something is ordered, the company says, for it to be picked, packed and sent on its way. Now, picture that scene and multiply it by 175. That's the number of \"fulfilment centres\", as Amazon likes to call them, that it has around the world. Even if you think you can visualise that never-ending blur of parcels crisscrossing the globe, you need to remember something else: that's just a fraction of what Amazon does. It is also a major streamer and media company (Amazon Prime Video); a market leader in home camera systems (Ring) and smart speakers (Alexa) and tablets and e-readers (Kindle); it hosts and supports vast swathes of the internet (Amazon Web Services); and much more besides. \"For a long time it has been called 'The Everything Store', but I think, at this point, Amazon is sort of 'The Everything Company',\" Bloomberg's Amanda Mull tells me. \"It's so large and so omnipresent and touches so many different parts of life, that after a while, people sort of take Amazon's existence in all kinds of elements of daily life sort of as a given,\" she says. Or, as the company itself once joked, pretty much the only way you could get though a day without enriching Amazon in some way was by \"living in a cave\".\n\nGetty Images Amazon has used sport to grow its streaming business\n\nSo the story of Amazon, since it was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, has been one of explosive growth, and continual reinvention. There has been plenty of criticism along the way too, over \"severe\" working conditions and how much tax it pays. But the main question as it enters its fourth decade appears to be: once you are The Everything Company, what do you do next? Or as Sucharita Kodali, who analyses Amazon for research firm Forrester, puts it: \"What the heck is left?\" \"Once you're at a half a trillion dollars in revenue, which they already are, how do you continue to grow at double digits year over year?\" One option is to try to tie the threads between existing businesses: the vast amounts of shopping data Amazon has for its Prime members might help it sell adverts on its streaming service, which - like its rivals - is increasingly turning to commercials for revenue. But that only goes so far - what benefits can Kuiper, its satellite division, bring to Whole Foods, its supermarket chain? To some extent, says Sucharita Kodali, the answer is to \"keep taking swings\" at new business ventures, and not worry if they fall flat. Just this week Amazon killed a business robot line after only nine months - Ms Kodali says that it is just one of a \"whole graveyard of bad ideas\" the company tried and discarded in order to find the successful ones. But, she says, Amazon may also have to focus on something else: the increasing attention of regulators, asking difficult questions like what does it do with our data, what environmental impact is it having, and is it simply too big? All of these issues could prompt intervention \"in the same way that we rolled back the monopolies that became behemoths in the early 20th century\", Ms Kodali says. For Juozas Kaziuk\u0117nas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, its size poses another problem: the places its Western customers live in simply can not take much more stuff. \"Our cities were not built for many more deliveries,\" he tells the BBC. That makes emerging economies like India, Mexico and Brazil important. But, Mr Kaziuk\u0117nas, suggests, there Amazon does not just need to enter the market but to some extent to make it. \"It's crazy and maybe should not be the case - but that's a conversation for another day,\" he says.\n\nGetty Images Shein and Temu are two of the brands from China that are competing with Amazon",

But a weaker economic backdrop would make policymakers more confident that inflationary pressures would not flare up again if they lower interest rates.\n\nMore specifically, it is the still-tight labour market that\u2019s kept the Fed nervous about cutting rates too soon as it\u2019s encouraged consumers to continue spending. But some signs are emerging of a cooldown in the jobs market as the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.0% in May despite the beat in the headline payrolls print. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have risen by 190k in June versus 272k in the prior month.\n\nAs long as the actual figure does not exceed 200k and there\u2019s no positive surprises in the jobless rate or average earnings either, markets would likely cheer the data.\n\nDollar Nosedives\n\nNevertheless, with the trading at three-week lows against a basket of currencies, there is a risk that investors have positioned themselves not to be disappointed by today\u2019s jobs numbers. A shock hot report could easily roil markets just as traders started to feel more hopeful of two Fed rate cuts this year, assigning an 80% probability of the first arriving in September.\n\nTreasury yields have also pulled back, although the downside is limited given the concerns about even bigger budget deficits should Donald Trump win November\u2019s presidential election.\n\nPound Holds Firm as Labour Win by a Landslide\n\nTalking of elections, there were no surprises in the UK\u2019s general election, with Labour winning a strong majority of over 160 seats, and Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservative party losing more than 250 seats in parliament.\n\nThere was little reaction in the pound, however, as the opinion polls proved accurate so a Labour government has already been fully priced in by the markets. is headed for weekly gains of more than 1% and the is enjoying a similarly positive week.\n\nFrance also goes to the polls on Sunday for the second round of legislative elections. With centrist and left-wing parties agreeing to withdraw their candidates in constituencies where there is a three-way runoff with the National Rally, there\u2019s been relief at the diminished prospect of a far-right government.\n\nStocks Set for Strong Weekly Gains, Bitcoin Can\u2019t Join in the Fun\n\nThe reduced political risks combined with expectations of an imminent dovish pivot by the Fed have lifted equity markets in Europe and America.\n\nUS futures point to slight gains when trading resumes today after the July 4th holiday and major European indices are up too.\n\nhas also been edging higher this week on the back of the dollar sell-off, but there\u2019s been no let-up in \u2019s slide.

    "summary": "But a weaker economic backdrop would make policymakers more confident that inflationary pressures would not flare up again if they lower interest rates.\nMore specifically, it is the still-tight labour market that\u2019s kept the Fed nervous about cutting rates too soon as it\u2019s encouraged consumers to continue spending.\nPound Holds Firm as Labour Win by a LandslideTalking of elections, there were no surprises in the UK\u2019s general election, with Labour winning a strong majority of over 160 seats, and Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservative party losing more than 250 seats in parliament.\nThere was little reaction in the pound, however, as the opinion polls proved accurate so a Labour government has already been fully priced in by the markets.\nhas also been edging higher this week on the back of the dollar sell-off, but there\u2019s been no let-up in \u2019s slide.",

    "title": "Gold Declines, Euro Rises as Traders Await NFP Data",
    "body": "The NFP Report Will Define the Gold Trend\n\nAfter the sharp rise on Wednesday, the gold (XAU) price declined by 0.03% on Thursday and consolidated within the $2,350\u2013$2,360 range.\n\nTraders are eagerly awaiting the release of the U.S. Nonfarm Payroll report today at 12:30 p.m. UTC, which will be a key factor in the Federal Reserve (Fed) decision regarding potential interest rate cuts. U.S. economic data over the past couple of weeks have significantly increased hopes for a rate reduction as early as September, and many investors expect today's report to support this outlook. Based on these anticipations, XAU/USD started to move upwards confidently. Gold has been rising throughout the week, benefiting from weak U.S. macroeconomic data. If today's employment data confirms a slowdown in the U.S. economy, expectations for a rate cut in September could exceed 80%, potentially pushing the price of gold towards $2,400. Currently, traders are pricing in about a 73% chance of a rate cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nis consolidating and seems ready to rise. The pair may break above $2,400 and possibly rise towards $2,450. However, according to the minutes of the last Fed meeting, officials decided to avoid premature conclusions and seek more data. Additional bullish impetus for gold could come from geopolitical risks, particularly the situation in the Middle East. The conflict between Israel and Hamas has somewhat cooled but is yet to be resolved.\n\nAs reported by Reuters: \"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday he has decided to send a delegation to resume stalled negotiations on a hostage release deal with Hamas, their administrations said\".\n\nToday, traders should prepare for increased volatility. The NFP report will come out at 12:30 p.m. UTC and define the XAU/USD trend movement. If the employment data reveals a softening labor market, the pair could rise towards $2,380\u2013$2,390. Otherwise, the price may drop towards the support level of $2,350.\n\nThe Euro Continues Rising While Traders Await the NFP Data\n\nThe euro (EUR) gained 0.22% during a relatively quiet trading session on Thursday, continuing the bullish impulse triggered by disappointing U.S. data on Wednesday.\n\nhas been rising since 26 June as some uncertainty surrounding the French elections has dissipated, while the critical U.S. data generally were weaker than expected, weakening the (USD). Moreover, the latest eurozone core inflation figures came out higher than expected. The inflation pace has raised doubt about whether the European Central Bank (ECB) can deliver two rate cuts this year, as the market hoped it would. Interest rate swap market data now implies that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may be more dovish than the ECB for the rest of the year. Traders currently price in roughly 49 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by the Fed until mid-December but expect just 40 bps of cuts by the ECB. This divergence in monetary policy expectations may continue to exert bullish pressure on EUR/USD in the short term.\n\nEUR/USD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, all eyes will be on the U.S. Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) report due at 12:30 p.m. UTC. The previous NFP data indicated that the U.S. economy added 272,000 jobs in May, significantly exceeding expectations of 185,000, one of the largest monthly gains in the last five months. This time, the market anticipates an additional 190,000 jobs created in June, which is relatively easy to exceed. If the upcoming data surpasses market expectations, it will support the US dollar and reduce the likelihood of the U.S. interest rate reduction in September. Thus, EUR/USD will correct downwards, possibly below 1.07900. Weak NFP data may put strong bearish pressure on the greenback and pull EUR/USD upwards, above 1.08500.\n\nETF Liquidations Trigger a Sell-Off in Bitcoin\n\n's (BTC) price plunged by 2% on Thursday and continued to decline during Friday's early trading session as the drop below $60,000 triggered a wave of ETF liquidations.\n\nUntil June, was in a clear uptrend supported by dovish monetary policy expectations across major central banks, strong ETF inflows, and a general trend towards diversification among global investors. However, after the pair failed to consolidate above the $70,000 level several times, some investors decided to exit the market temporarily. Over the past four weeks, BTC/USD has lost some 14% in value, mostly due to crypto-specific factors such as investors cashing out their profits and miners selling more coins. Lately, some important fundamental factors also started to affect cryptocurrencies. According to Lookonchain, a blockchain investigator, Germany\u2019s government transferred some of its BTC holdings to crypto exchanges Bitstamp and Kraken, suggesting that the country may be preparing to sell its coins.\n\nAs the bearish pressure continued to intensify, BTC approached the critically important $60,000 level and eventually dropped below it, triggering an additional wave of selling.\n\n\"We estimate that the average bitcoin ETF entry price is $60,000 to $61,000, and retesting this level could result in a wave of liquidations\", said Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research.\n\nIndeed, the BTC price dropped by more than 7% earlier today in just a few hours. Still, despite the recent sell-off, overall economic conditions and the prevailing buy-the-dip investment strategy could lead towards a swift rebound in Bitcoin's price.",

    "body": "The UK\u2019s Labour Party is set to win a highly anticipated landslide victory in the general election. is at 1.2780, and the are pointing at a positive start to the session.\n\nWith the general election behind us, more political uncertainty, and hopefully fewer scandals ahead, the Labour win is seen as being a net positive for the and British stocks. Cable fell from near 1.50 pre-Brexit to almost parity at the peak of the Tory disillusion with Liz Truss mini-budget crisis.\n\nThe changing government gives hope that at least a part of the weakness can be recovered. For stocks, small and medium-sized stocks are expected to perform stronger than the , which is more exposed to global economic dynamics due to its high concentration of energy and mining stocks.\n\nHowever, both should benefit from the upcoming rate cut from the Bank of England (BoE) and other major central banks at the end of the year. The FTSE 100 was up by 0.86% yesterday on Labour victory vibes and should easily throw itself above the 50-DMA before the weekly closing bell.\n\nIn France, the situation looks better from a market perspective. The latest polls suggest that Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally could fall \u2018well short\u2019 of a majority at this weekend\u2019s second and final tour of legislative elections. The party is predicted to win 190 to 250 seats out of 577, which will leave it significantly below the 289 majority needed to pass bills easily.\n\nThe French will probably not see their taxes lowered as promised by Le Pen, and investors will hopefully not see the French debt levels explode irresponsibly following this chaotic \u2018snap election\u2019 parentheses. Investors are now in a hurry to return to French assets and the euro at discounted prices not to miss the post-election rally next Monday.\n\nThe spread between the German and French 10-year yield fell below 70 from last week\u2019s peak of 86. The jumped past the 200-DMA yesterday and is testing a major Fibonacci level to the upside before the weekly closing bell.\n\nThe index remains below the 8000 mark, where it was trading when Macron announced the snap election. It will probably shrug off the election fear with a further recovery. In the medium run, a hung government will prevent the French from moving forward with any reforms, which is positive when you think of unsustainable tax cuts. But that might not be positive for long-term growth as other reforms will also be blocked.\n\nAnyway, the EUR/USD extended gains past 1.0820 this morning, and given the FOMO's post-election rally in the euro, we might see further gains before the weekly closing bell.\n\nJobs Day!\n\nThe US will reveal its latest job figures today, and the Federal Reserve (Fed) doves are waiting in ambush to boost their rate-cut bets. The US economy is expected to have added around 190K new jobs in June, down from 272K printed a month earlier, and wage growth is weaker.\n\nA weaker-than-expected set of data should further fuel the Fed rate cut bets and weigh on the yields and the . At the same time, a positive surprise should get the Fed doves to scale back their rate cut bets, that have been rising lately, thanks to soft economic data and dovish Fed comments, and throw a floor under the yields and back the dollar.\n\nThe US dollar slipped below its 50-DMA yesterday on the back of rising dovish Fed voices and a political-led rebound in the and the pound. The is getting ready to test the 105 support to the downside. The major support for this year\u2019s bullish trend is at a distant 104.20 level, meaning that the dollar has room to soften if the data satisfies the Fed doves.\n\nFor equities, soft data (not too soft) wouldn\u2019t be bad. The major US indices do not reflect at all the underlying economic dynamics right now. They are mostly decoupled from the economic reality of high inflation and slowing growth.\n\nThe only thing that matters right now is the strength of appetite for technology stocks, which remains very strong and is supported by the expectation of upcoming rate cuts.\n\nhas just hit the 1000 mark this week in Taiwan for the first time in history, after more than doubling its stock price since the beginning of last year. is responsible for a whopping 30% gains of this year, while the Dutch accounted for around 38% of the gains of the this year.\n\nA chart from Bloomberg shows how the correlations between the stocks in the US and the European markets have never been this low in more than a decade. This is alarming because the lower the correlation, the lower the diversification within the index, and the lower diversification the higher the risk of a sudden and sharp downturn. The question is: when?",

    "body": "In JPMorgan\u2019s (JPM), \u201cGuide to the Market\u201d presentation last Monday, July 1 \u201924, Dr. David Kelly, JPMorgan\u2019s Chief Global Strategist, started off the call with the remark that, ultimately, \u201call systems break down\u201d. David was quoting or paraphrasing one of the JPMorgan analysts, who had an engineering background by education, with the analyst using the word \u201centropy\u201d in one of her missives. In physics, the word entropy\u2019s 2nd level definition is \u201ca gradual decline into disorder\u201d, which we can loosely interpret as \u201call systems break down\u201d.\n\nNow, this is no way was a market call on Dr. Kelly\u2019s part. Personally, I thought it was a good intro into a discussion about the economy and the markets today, both of which are seemingly in pretty good shape, but is a polite and disarming way to say that \u2013 in essence \u2013 all bull markets and good economies come to an end. (David Kelly is such a likable guy and has a very unpretentious and disarmingly collegial personality, that I hope readers will understand that nothing written here will reflect on David\u2019s opening remarks to the Guide to the Market webcast.)\n\nS&P 500 Annualized Returns:\n\nReturn source: Ycharts software\n\nAfter the decade of 2009, a considered effort was made by this blog to avoid similar mistakes to the late 1990s and one aspect of what some might call post-mortem analysis, was to try and identify factors (other than the constant parade of overvaluation calls for the and the between 1995 and March 2000), that were in evidence, (and there were many on a daily and weekly basis), and the \u201cannual return\u201d or annualized return data for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq was definitely flashing red. The S&P 500\u2019s annual return alone for the period from 1995 to 1999 was 28% a year (think about that) and that doesn\u2019t include the period from January 1 \u20182000 to mid-March 2000. The Nasdaq alone doubled from September \u201999 to March 2000, a period of just 6 months.\n\nThe problem with the 1990s was that stock market returns were \u201cbinary\u201d (becoming similar to today): you were either largely a growth investor, and kept up with the S&P 500, or \u2013 as an investment advisor or hedge-fund manager \u2013 you were largely valued, and underperformed dramatically for 5 1/2 years. Value investing back then ( and value was defined as below 1x price-to-book, under 10x PE, etc.) was largely commodity stock investing, and small-cap driven as \u2013 just like today \u2013 small-cap, equal-weight, value, and international remain completely out-of-favor.\n\nThe other aspect of this not always well understood is that in every bull market, there is a \u201d generational difference\u201d around investing. My first analyst job at a mutual fund firm was from 1992 to 1995, and the first day I started, I saw a terminal device on my desk, (it looked like a small TV) after I had been working with PCs and spreadsheet software for several years already. Because this firm had been in existence since the late 1940s and had managed money for many iconic American families, the older portfolio managers (both the stand-alone guys who were more similar to brokers and the mutual fund managers), seemed very leery of the personal computer and technology in general. (The research department was quickly given PCs and spreadsheet software.) Many wanted to stay with the device tied to the mainframe, even though IBM (NYSE: ) was blowing up and dropping from its high of $175 pre-October, 1987, crash to the early 90\u2019s $50 share price.\n\nA lot of older investors (men and women, as women were starting to manage mutual funds at that time) were just leery of tech in the 1990s. Now, 25 \u2013 30 years later, I\u2019m that person, not in discipline, but I\u2019m that \u201cold guy\u201d who is looking at AI and LLMs (large language models) and thinking, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll play this through the ETF\u2019s rather than individual stocks\u201d.\n\nA Red Flag:\n\nGetting back to the \u201cannual return\u201d table at the top of the page, note the black-bordered area in the lower right-hand corner. Just like the black-bordered area in the middle-left of the table which occurred in late 2021 (which prompted these articles from , the lower right-hand corner shows recent annualized returns for the S&P 500, which are not sustainable.\n\nThe 18-month annualized return for the S&P 500 is 28.55%. That\u2019s a tad stretched. If nothing else, investors could (and should) expect a good flush, a correction greater than April, \u201924\u2019s -4.08% drop in the S&P 500, and the \u2019s and Nasdaq 100 total returns of -4.48% and -4.63% respectively.\n\nTop 10 Holdings:\n\nOccasionally this blog details clients' top 10 positions when aggregating all client assets as one portfolio, since so much of this blog\u2019s writings are for stocks that aren\u2019t covered daily in the mainstream financial media. Here\u2019s client's Top 10 holdings as of June 30 \u201924 and the YTD return for the holding:\n\nJP Morgan Income Fund: +3.31%\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: ): +19.26%\n\nJPMorgan: +20.12%\n\nOakmark Int\u2019l: -4.17%\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: ): +27.29%\n\nNasdaq 100 (QQQ): +17.34%\n\nCharles Schwab (NYSE: ): +7.83%\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: ): +30.54%\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ: ): +38.61%\n\nSPY: +15.23%\n\nMerck: +14.97%\n\nEmerging Mkt ETF (NASDAQ: ) (ex-China): +7.76%\n\nThis distribution is distorted by 1 \u2013 2 large 100% equity accounts. The majority of the accounts and assets are managed on a \u201cbalanced\u201d basis, using some derivation of the traditional 60% / 40% standard portfolio benchmark target.\n\nThe S&P 500 (total return) returned 15.29% in the first half of \u201924;\n\nThe 60% / 40% standard balance portfolio returned 8.78% in the first half of 2024;\n\n( ): +1.62% YTD return\n\nConclusion:\n\nOn Friday morning, July 5th, investors will get the June report at 7:30 am central, and given how weak the ISM \u2013 Services report was on Wednesday, July 3rd, \u201924, the Treasury market rallied sharply in response to the surprisingly weak data. Services are roughly 85% of GDP in today\u2019s economy, so services data matters.\n\nwas written on June 8 \u201924, drawing similarities between today\u2019s S&P 500 and the late 1990\u2019s.\n\nThe big difference between today and 24 years ago is sentiment: stock market sentiment today is borderline \u201cfearful\u201d but seems almost apathetic. The peak in 2021 was led by Bitcoin and SPACs. It\u2019s been two and half years since we\u2019ve heard about SPACs, but still gets some press but is hardly the frenzy that it was in 2021. This is important since sentiment can drive markets higher (and lower) than might otherwise be found at normal valuations.\n\nEd Yardeni, one of the Wall Street greats, throws a wet blanket on some of the AI hype this weekend with this article released on LinkedIn on July 2nd, 2024. Ed raises a good point about the semiconductor cycle i.e. it\u2019s still a cycle, and also questions some of Jensen Huang\u2019s and Sam Altman\u2019s prognostications. (In my words, the hyperbole is really flowing)\n\nTom Lee, in my opinion, one of the best market prognosticators in the last 5 \u2013 10 years, came out this past week, and said he thought the S&P 500 could get to 15,000 or triple by the year 2030. That is pretty ambitious. If it wasn\u2019t Tom Lee, the forecast probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten the media attention it did.\n\nJust an average correction of 10% \u2013 15% for the S&P 500 would go a long way to restore the \u201cwall of worry\u201d to investing. The S&P 500 could use a good flush.\n\nNone of this is advice or a recommendation, but only an opinion, which should be taken with considerable skepticism. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investing can involve the loss of principal even for short periods of time. All return data courtesy of Ycharts.\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "title": "Nvidia Too Hot? Here's How to Ride the AI Wave With Lesser Risk",
    "body": "For those keen to invest in NVIDIA stock but deterred by the recent onslaught, an alternative option may be the most sensible pathway.\n\nIndeed, the AI gold rush, stellar earnings, a 10-for-1 split, and a doubling of dividends have helped NVIDIA shares gain almost 160% YTD. However, it cannot be ignored that the tech giant lost more than $500 billion in market capitalization over three trading sessions soon after it toppled , brutally exposing its volatility.\n\nshares briefly surpassed Microsoft and last month to become the world\u2019s most valuable company. However, the glory was short-lived, as the chipmaker shed 8% of its value in the days following.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Volatile Nature\n\nNVIDIA shares gained almost 200% on June 18 (Tuesday) to become the world\u2019s most valuable company. However, in stark contrast, the following week saw the firm suffer the greatest three-day value loss in stock market history.\n\nThis volatility in NVIDIA stock is expected to continue for some time, with experts arguing that the stock\u2019s steep climb makes it vulnerable to further profit-taking.\n\nJune\u2019s $500 billion sell-off also raised concerns about NVIDIA being overvalued. Several analysts, including financial research strategist Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank, warned of \u201csigns of over-exuberance\u201d in relation to the AI stock.\n\nRising competition is another factor that could drive volatility in NVIDIA shares. Patrick Moorhead, Moor Insights & Strategy founder and CEO, told Yahoo Finance that NVIDIA is competing not just with \u201cmerchant silicon providers\u201d like and , but also with \u201chomegrown ones\u201d from \u2019s AWS, Microsoft\u2019s Azure, and .\n\nAnother headwind for the Silicon Valley chip maker could be the charges by the French antitrust regulator. , in a recent report citing sources familiar with the matter, noted that the French antitrust regulator will charge the chip maker for anti-competitive practices.\n\nIf the charges stand up, NVIDIA could face monetary fines and may have to alter its business practices. Financial penalties may not be of much concern, but if NVIDIA is asked to make operational changes, it could impact NVIDIA\u2019s competitive edge and market strategy.\n\nSo, What\u2019s the Alternate?\n\nInvesting in a high-growth stock like NVIDIA comes with a certain amount of risk. If you can stomach this, you can invest directly in the stock. But if not, there are other ways to get in on the AI stock frenzy, and chief among them is opting for an index fund.\n\nIndex funds are passive investments that are designed to mimic (not outperform) the stock market. Investors who are less bullish but willing to bet on the future of AI can still profit from NVIDIA\u2019s meteoric rise by investing in a tech-focused index fund, such as a tracker fund.\n\nFor instance, tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, which itself tracks the 100 biggest stocks listed on the NASDAQ. It is a growth-focused index fund heavily weighted toward the technology sector. NVIDIA is Invesco QQQ Trust\u2019s third biggest holding (7.56%), with Microsoft (8.51) and Apple (8.19%) being the first two.\n\nThe Invesco QQQ Trust has returned about 170% over the past five years, or about 22% annually. This fund has outperformed the in the past and is likely to beat it in the future as well. During the last two decades, the Invesco QQQ Trust has compounded 14.6% annually, compared to 10.3% for the S&P 500 during the same period.\n\nInvesting through such funds comes with a fee. The Invesco QQQ Trust, for instance, has an expense ratio of 0.2%. It means you pay $20 per year for every $10,000 invested. Still, index funds are a good option for risk-tolerant investors who want to reduce their exposure to volatile investments such as NVIDIA shares.",

Odds of the U.S. central bank easing in September jumped to 79% from 66% seen before the data, CME's FedWatch Tool showed.\n\n\"This report puts the Fed in a comfortable spot,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities.\n\n\"If this continues next month, with no increases in hourly wages, then I think we'll see a rate cut in September and another one in December.\"\n\nData released earlier this week also pointed to the U.S. economy losing steam, helping the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notch record closing highs during Wednesday's holiday-shortened session.\n\n\"We're in this kind of stagflation adjacent environment - growth is moderating, inflation is staying where it is for the time being,\" said Alex McGrath, chief investment officer for NorthEnd Private Wealth.\n\nHe said the environment is not great for small caps, which are sensitive to interest rates, but megacap companies are pumping out strong earnings which keep the market strong.\n\nThe Small Cap index is down 0.95% for the week.\n\nMajor banks fell ahead of second-quarter corporate earnings reports starting next Friday.\n\nHigher interest rates and an uncertain economic environment are casting a cloud over U.S. bank earnings.\n\nBank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan & Chase dropped between 1.2% to 1.7%, pushing the S&P 500 banks index 1.6% lower.\n\nMacy's (NYSE: ) on Friday surged 9.5% after a report said Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital raised their bid to buy the department store chain for about $6.9 billion.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.04-to-1 ratio on the NYSE.

    "title": "New PM Starmer pledges to rebuild Britain after years of chaos By Reuters",
    "body": "By Kylie MacLellan, William James and Sarah Young\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -Britain's new Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged on Friday to use his massive electoral majority to rebuild the country, saying he wanted to take the heat out of politics after years of upheaval and strife.\n\nStanding outside his new office and residence at Number 10 Downing Street, Starmer acknowledged the scale of the challenge after his party's landslide victory in a parliamentary election ended 14 years of often tumultuous Conservative government.\n\nHe warned that any improvements would take time, and he would need to first rebuild faith in politics.\n\n\"This lack of trust can only be healed by actions, not words. I know that,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether you voted Labour or not, in fact, especially if you did not, I say to you directly - My government will serve you. Politics can be a force for good. We will show that.\"\n\nStarmer was greeted by huge cheers and took time before making his speech to shake hands with and hug aides and well-wishers who lined Downing Street - scenes that were reminiscent of Labour predecessor Tony Blair's arrival in government in 1997.\n\nStanding behind a lectern, he said he understood that many Britons were disillusioned with politics after years of scandal and chaos under the Conservatives, who were roundly rejected in Thursday's election, suffering a historic loss.\n\nStarmer said the rejection signalled that Britain was ready for a reset: \"Because no matter how fierce the storms of history, one of the great strengths of this nation has always been our ability to navigate away to calmer waters.\"\n\nMASSIVE MAJORITY\n\nThe centre-left Labour won a massive majority in the 650-seat parliament, prompting Rishi Sunak's resignation on Friday morning, before Starmer went to meet King Charles and be formally named prime minister.\n\nHe said he would fight every day to rebuild trust, saying Britain would have a \"government unburdened by doctrine\", underlining something he had repeated during the campaign - that he would put country first, party second.\n\n\"To defy, quietly, those who have written our country off. You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change.\"\n\nThe election result has upended British politics. Labour won more than 410 seats, an increase of 211, while the Conservatives, the western world's most successful party, lost 250 lawmakers, including a record number of senior ministers and former Prime Minister Liz Truss.\n\nSunak's Conservatives suffered the worst performance in the party's long history as voters punished them for a cost of living crisis, failing public services and a series of scandals.\n\n\"To the country I would like to say first and foremost I am sorry,\" Sunak said outside Downing Street, adding he would stay as Conservative leader until the party was ready to appoint his replacement.\n\n\"I have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change, and yours is the only judgment that matters. I have heard your anger, your disappointment and I take responsibility for this loss.\"\n\nTOUGH ROAD AHEAD\n\nDespite Starmer's convincing victory, polls suggested there was little enthusiasm for Starmer or his party. Thanks to the quirk of Britain's first-past-the-post system and a low turnout, Labour's triumph was achieved with fewer votes than it secured in 2017 and 2019 - the latter its worst result in terms of seats won for 84 years.\n\nThe pound and British stocks and government bonds rose marginally on Friday, but Starmer comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges.\n\nBritain's tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after World War Two, net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output, living standards have fallen, and public services are creaking, especially the much cherished National Health Service which has been dogged by strikes.\n\nSome of Labour's more ambitious plans, such as its flagship green spending pledges, have already been scaled back, while Starmer has promised not to raise taxes for \"working people\".\n\nLikewise, he has promised to scrap the Conservative's policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, but with migration a key electoral issue, he will be under pressure himself to find a way to stop tens of thousands of people arriving across the Channel from France on small boats.\n\n\"I don't promise you it will be easy,\" Starmer said earlier at a victory rally. \"Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. It's hard work. Patient, determined, work, and we will have to get moving immediately.\"\n\nHis first appointments to his top team of ministers contained no surprises.\n\nRachel Reeves was named as Britain's first female finance minister, Angela Rayner was made deputy prime minister and David Lammy was appointed foreign minister, all keeping the policy briefs they had held in opposition.\n\nBritain's election result showed growth in support for the right-wing Reform party, led by Nigel Farage, echoing recent similar results in Europe where the far-right have been surging.\n\nBut, unlike France where Marine Le Pen's National Rally party made historic gains in an election last Sunday, overall the British public has plumped for a centre-left party to bring about change.\n\nStarmer has promised to improve relations with the European Union after Brexit, but Labour has said rejoining the EU was not on the table.\n\nHe may also have to work with Trump if he wins November's presidential election.

The historic average is nearly 73 kg.\n\nThe South American nation's economy has been hit hard by triple-digit inflation, a recession and rising poverty and unemployment.\n\nLibertarian President Javier Milei, who took office in December, has rolled out austerity measures to reign in government spending.

    "body": "BENGALURU (Reuters) -Retail sales of cars in India fell 6.8% in June, marking their worst decline in almost two and half years, a dealers' body said on Friday, as heatwaves across the country kept customers from visiting showrooms.\n\nPassenger vehicle sales in June dropped to 281,566 units, their lowest since September 2022, according to data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), which tracks monthly retail sales from dealers to buyers.\n\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\n\nAuto sales are seen as a key indicator of private consumption in the country. India's auto industry forms 7% of the country's GDP, as per government data.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nThe intense heat in India has reduced footfall at dealerships by 15%, leading to fewer people buying cars, according to FADA.\n\nWeak retail sales of cars result in higher inventory costs that hurt dealers' financials. In June, dealers had an inventory buildup of 62-67 days, FADA said. The recommended level is of three weeks.\n\nStill, the SUV portfolios of companies, including that of Maruti Suzuki, benefitted from strong demand, extending record-high sales seen in the financial year 2024.\n\nMARKET REACTION\n\nSUV maker Mahindra & Mahindra's shares fell as much as 2.2% on the day, before trimming some losses. Larger rivals Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors (NYSE: ) each fell as much as 0.6%.\n\nKEY QUOTES\n\n\"Dealer feedback highlights challenges such as low customer enquiries and postponed purchase decisions,\" FADA President Manish Raj Singhania said in a statement.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nCategory Total June Y/Y change Y/Y change\n\nsales in June in May (%)\n\n(units) (%)\n\nOverall 1,895,552 0.7 2.6\n\nsales\n\nPassenger 281,566 -6.8 -1\n\nVehicles\n\n(cars)\n\nTwo-wheele 1,375,889 4.7 2.5\n\nrs\n\nThree-whee 94,321 5.1 20.1\n\nlers\n\nCommercial 72,747 -4.7 4.1\n\nvehicles\n\nTractors 71,029 -28.4 -1.1",

    "title": "What happens if you use a debit card as credit?",
    "body": "You probably think of debit cards and credit cards as two totally separate things: One pulls money from your checking account and the other lets you borrow against a line of credit. For the most part, that's correct.\n\nWhat most people don't realize, however, is that you can choose to use your debit card as \"credit\" at checkout. That doesn't mean you borrow money to make the purchase, but it does change some aspects of the transaction. Here\u2019s what you need to know about running a debit transaction as credit.\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nCan you use a debit card as a credit card?\n\nIf your debit card has a Visa or Mastercard logo on it, you can use it as credit. To do this, you simply choose \"credit\" on the PIN pad or in the payment options at checkout. Alternatively, if you hand your debit card to a cashier or server, you can tell them you want to pay with credit instead of debit.\n\nThen, instead of providing your PIN to authorize and complete the transaction, you'll probably be asked for your signature \u2014 usually if the transaction is over $25.\n\nWhat happens if you select 'credit' for a debit transaction?\n\nIf you select \"credit\" for your debit card transaction, a few unique things happen. The payment is still processed as a debit from your linked checking account , but the transaction will be different from a regular debit purchase in these ways:\n\nProcessing speed : The payment can take up to three days longer to process since it goes through the Visa or Mastercard network instead of coming directly from your account.\n\nAuthorization : You authorize the transaction with your signature (usually for transactions over $25) and not your PIN.\n\nRewards : If your debit card has rewards, you might have to choose the credit/signature option to earn rewards or to earn the maximum rewards available.\n\nCash back : Since you don't enter a PIN, you won't be able to get cash back from the merchant.\n\nLiability : Visa and Mastercard both provide zero liability, meaning you won't have to cover unauthorized credit transactions on your debit card.\n\nMerchant fees: The merchant pays higher fees \u2014 averaging about $0.24 per transaction \u2014 when you choose credit.\n\nIn terms of security, the best option is to tap the card rather than swiping or inserting it, regardless of whether you choose credit or not. That's because the \"contactless\" tap option protects your debit card data by encrypting it.\n\nRead more: When to use your credit card over your debit card\n\nDoes using a debit card as credit help your credit score?\n\nUsing a debit card as credit does not involve borrowing money, so it doesn't impact your credit score. Additionally, information about your debit activity is not reported to any credit bureaus, whether you use the account as credit or not.\n\nYour debit card activity can, however, impact your ChexSystems report. ChexSystem reports contain information about your banking history, including details such as whether your bank accounts have been closed for non-sufficient funds . You can pull your ChexSystems report for free once a year at ChexSystems.com .\n\nRead more: Can overdrafting affect your credit score?\n\nCredit-building debit cards\n\nThere are a few new debit cards that act like hybrids between debt and credit. These cards have a credit-card-like feature that lets you \"borrow\" money to cover certain transactions, and then withdraw the funds from your bank account to pay the debt right away. Then the account activity is reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus, which can help you build up your credit score .\n\nPros and cons of running a debit card as credit\n\nShould I use my debit card as credit?\n\nWhether or not you use debit cards as credit is a matter of preference. If you want to delay the transaction from processing or you want to earn rewards on a rewards debit card, credit is the best choice. You can also limit your liability by choosing the credit option.\n\nIf you want your checking account balance to reflect recent transactions right away, regular debit transactions are the way to go.",

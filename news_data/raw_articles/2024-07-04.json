    "body": "CNN \u2014\n\n2024 is already shaping up to be another banner year for nudity around the world with a nude cruise and nude beach weddings on the horizon.\n\nEarlier this year, tour and travel company Bare Necessities announced an 11-day voyage from Miami to the Caribbean in collaboration with Norwegian Cruise Line. It\u2019s due to set sail in February 2025.\n\nWith stopovers in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, \u201cThe Big Nude Boat\u201d is billed as a \u201conce in a lifetime experience\u201d with amenities designed to \u201cfit everyone\u2019s style of bare cruising.\u201d\n\nAnd couples will soon be able to tie the knot sans clothes at Is Benas Beach in Sardinia, which has a naturist-designated area.\n\nThe news was confirmed in May by Luigi Tedeschi, mayor of San Vero Milis, the closest town to the beach.\n\n\u201cNudity has nothing to do with sex. For [naturists], it\u2019s a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature,\u201d Tedeschi said. \u201cIt should be respected \u2013 so why not?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there are more places than ever to sun, swim or build sandcastles au naturel at clothing-optional beaches around the world.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Nudist explains what you should definitely not do at a nude beach 02:23 - Source: CNN\n\nFrom rocky coastlines to talcum-powder fine sands and big city bays to secluded shores, there are now hundreds of beaches where it\u2019s perfectly legal (or at least de facto legal) to frolic beside the sea in nothing more than your birthday suit.\n\n\u201cSoft, smooth sand, warm ocean breeze, gentle ocean waves and lots of other naturists makes for a great clothing-optional beach,\u201d says Nicky Hoffman of The Naturist Society, who\u2019s also the managing editor of Nude & Natural magazine and co-author of \u201cThe World\u2019s Best Nude Beaches & Resorts.\u201d\n\nWhile clothing-optional beach destinations may seem like a modern invention, it\u2019s actually quite an old idea, a product of the otherwise prudish Victorian era.\n\nDuring the 1880s, American poet Walt Whitman extolled the virtues of the \u201cAdamic air bath\u201d \u2013 his nude walkabouts and swims along Timber Creek in New Jersey, writing of \u201cthe free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature.\u201d\n\nChanneling that same vibe, the naturist movement took off in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th century, with city parks, camp grounds and eventually beaches established for those who wanted to experience nature nude in their most natural state.\n\nOne of the spin-offs of the socially and sexually liberal 1960s was a \u201cfree beach\u201d movement that saw a proliferation of nude beaches around the world.\n\nAnd their popularity continues today, with more and more popping up each year. Here are 24 of the best nude beaches you can visit around the world in 2024:\n\nPlaya Naturista Chihuahua, Uruguay\n\nLocated about a 30-minute drive from Punta del Este, Uruguay\u2019s best-known nude beach overlooks Portezuelo Bay on the Atlantic coast.\n\nPhotogenic dunes and water temperatures that reach 25 Celsius (77 F) and higher even in the Southern Hemisphere winter add to the strand\u2019s allure.\n\nAfter decades as an unofficial naked getaway, Chihuahua finally achieved legal status in 2000.\n\nSince then, amenities have expanded to include the Hotel El Refugio Nudista Naturista clothing-optional resort.\n\nPlaya Naturista Chihuahua, Avenida Las Amarras, 20003 Chihuahua, Uruguay\n\nNida Nude Beach, Lithuania\n\nThe chilly Baltic Sea may not seem like the most obvious place to skinny dip. But this gorgeous strand on the long, sandy Curonian Spit offers one of Europe\u2019s most picturesque spots to take it all off.\n\nWith its wildflower-covered dunes (among the highest in Europe) and shoreline forest, the beach was the focus of a 19th-century artists\u2019 colony that attracted many of the leading painters, poets and writers of the time.\n\nWalk far enough south along the strand and you eventually come to a fence that marks the Lithuania-Russia border.\n\nNida Nude Beach, Nidos-Smiltyn\u0117s pl., Nida, Lithuania\n\nAgesta Beach, Sweden\n\nSweden may be home to many beaches where nudity is accepted, but Agesta Beach, located roughly 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Stockholm, is its only official nude beach.\n\nBased in the southern end of the lake Magelungen, Agesta Beach\u2019s sandy shores are popular with locals as well as visitors looking for an escape from the bustling capital city.\n\nOpen from May to September, this beach is very well looked after, with picnic tables, BBQ areas, public bathrooms and play areas for children available.\n\nAgesta Beach, Huddinge, Sweden\n\nLittle Palm Beach, Waiheke, New Zealand\n\nLittle Palm Beach is situated on Waiheke Island in New Zealand. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nAlthough it\u2019s technically legal to go naked on any beach in personal-liberty-loving New Zealand, the nation\u2019s naturists tend to congregate at well-known clothing-optional spots like Little Palm Beach on Waiheke Island.\n\nReaching the secluded strand entails a 40-to-60-minute ferry ride from Auckland, a taxi or rideshare to the island\u2019s north shore, and then a short downhill hike.\n\nYou can top or tail your beach adventure at Waiheke\u2019s many wineries, restaurants, and art galleries.\n\nLittle Palm Beach, Miro Road, Waiheke Island 1081, New Zealand\n\nNugal Beach, Croatia\n\nFlanked by sheer cliffs and shades by pine trees, this remote beach on the mainland opposite Bra\u010d island is reached via a narrow path that seems ready made for goats rather than people seeking an apparel-free escape on the Adriatic.\n\nBe sure to bring a thick towel or even a beach chair \u2014 like many Croatian beaches the surface is pebbles rather than sand.\n\nNugal is about a half-an-hour walk from the nearest town, although it can also be reached by boat or sea kayak from Makarska or Tu\u010depi.\n\nNugal Beach, 21300 Makarska, Croatia\n\nMoshup Beach, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts\n\nMoshup Beach can be found on the west side of Martha's Vineyard. Loop Images/Universal Images Group Editorial/Getty Images\n\nPerched at the island\u2019s western extreme, Moshup is a long curving strand that wraps around a headline crowned by the historic Gay Head Lighthouse (built in 1799).\n\nLocated right below the ancient light, the clothing optional portion lies beneath rust-colored sandstone cliffs that were declared a National Natural Monument in 1966.\n\nMoshup is open free of charge to anyone who wants to take their clothes off, as opposed to Lucy Vincent, the island\u2019s private nude beach.\n\nMoshup Beach, 71 Moshup Trail, Aquinnah, MA 02535\n\nBlack\u2019s Beach, La Jolla, California\n\nSet beneath the high cliffs of Torrey Pines, Blacks has been the Golden State\u2019s favorite place for all-over tans for more than 50 years and was once the only legal nude beach in the entire United States.\n\nLong, wide and blessed with great surf, the beach is reached via the zig-zag Ho Chi Minh Trail from La Jolla Farms Road or the Citizens Trail from Torrey Pines Gliderport near the University of California, San Diego.\n\nBlack\u2019s Beach, Torrey Pines Scenic Drive, San Diego, CA 92037\n\nLady Bay Beach, Sydney, Australia\n\nLady Bay Beach was first granted legal status in 1976. Evelyn Proimos/Flickr\n\nAlthough it sometimes seems like just about any beach in Australia is clothing optional, there are a number of official nude beaches here such as Lady Bay. (also known as Lady Jane Beach.)\n\nPerched just inside the South Head of Sydney Harbour, it\u2019s small and narrow, but incredibly secluded for such a big city location.\n\nThe rocky ledges around South Head are also used for nude sunbathing.\n\nLady Bay Beach, Watson\u2019s Bay, Sydney, Australia\n\nBuhne 16, Sylt, Germany\n\n\u201cGrin and bare it\u201d might well be the motto for nudists on this North Sea island, where the average water temperature in summer is a chilly 17 C (63 F).\n\nTechnically all of the beaches on Sylt are clothing optional, but Buhne 16 was the first and is still the foremost location for nude sunbathing along the German shore.\n\nIt\u2019s a place where beachgoers can chill in the famous blue and white striped wicker beach chairs or let it all hang out at summer beach parties.\n\nBuhne 16, Listlandstr 133b, 25980 Kampen (Sylt), German\n\nWreck Beach, Vancouver, Canada\n\nBilled as one of the world\u2019s longest nude beaches at 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) long, Wreck Beach is actually a series of sandy strands, pebble flats and rocky outcrops wrapped around the end of Point Grey.\n\nWith the University of British Columbia just across the street, a steady stream of students and teachers have shed their clothes on this beach since the early 1970s, when it first became popular.\n\nEvergreen trees along the shore and snowcapped peaks across the water complement the Canadian ambiance.\n\nWreck Beach, Vancouver, British Columbia; Canada\n\nRed Beach, Crete, Greece\n\nThis secluded shore on the south side of Crete is a hotspot for nude sunbathing in Greece.\n\nNamed after its ocher-colored sand and cliffs, Red Beach (or Kokkini Ammos) is reached via a 20-minute hike from Matala or a very short boat ride from the village waterfront.\n\nPioneered by Euro hippies during the 1960s, the beach offers chair and umbrella rentals and is home to a funky little bar called Yianni\u2019s that\u2019s renowned for its mojitos.\n\nNote: the mysterious rock carvings at the end of the beach are a modern creation and definitely not ancient Minoan relics.\n\nRed Beach, Matala, Crete 702 00, Greece\n\nCallantsoog Beach, Netherlands\n\nCallantsoog is the oldest nudist beach in the Netherlands, having been officially recognized as a nudist beach since 1973.\n\nSituated 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Amsterdam, near the coastal town of Callantsoog, this beautiful stretch of sand enjoys Blue Flag status and is a great place to spot seals.\n\nIts designated nudist section is marked between two poles.\n\nThose keen to get even closer to nature can pay a visit to the nearby Zwanenwater, a protected nature reserve and home to the largest natural dune lakes in Europe.\n\nCallantsoog Beach, Strandslag Dorpsplein, 1759 Callantsoog, Netherlands\n\nAnse de Grande Saline, St. Barts\n\nWhile the Caribbean may be full of wonderful, chilled out beaches, this wild, white sand strand on the rear side of St. Barts is one of the few places on the islands where public nudity is tolerated (although sunbathing naked is technically prohibited in St. Barts.)\n\nAnse de Grande Saline (or Saline Beach) is another self-catering beach. Visitors will need to bring along everything they need for a day at the shore, especially sunscreen, as there is no shade to speak of.\n\nL\u2019Esprit, an excellent French restaurant, is within walking distance of Grand Saline and well worth a visit. Just make sure to put your clothes back on before heading over.\n\nAnse de Grande Saline, St. Barth\u00e9lemy\n\nPlatja des Cavallet, Ibiza, Spain\n\nSet between the deep blue Mediterranean and multicolored salt pans near Ibiza\u2019s southernmost point, official nudist beach Es Cavallet is separated into various different sections, including a beach club party section, a gay scene and a more secluded, middle section where the clothing-free crowd hang out.\n\nHowever nude sunbathers aren\u2019t the only beings who frequent this area. Those bright pink things you\u2019ll see pacing in the background aren\u2019t sunburned tourists, but rather flamingos that like to gather in the shallow salines.\n\nPlatja des Cavallet, 07818, Balearic Islands, Spain\n\nLittle Beach, Maui, Hawaii\n\nLittle Beach -- a clothing-optional beach in Maui's Makena State Park. Shutterstock\n\nFlanked by ancient lava flows and backed by a volcanic cinder cone, Little Beach would be super-cool even if you didn\u2019t take your clothes off. Like many such beaches, going sans swimsuit is not officially sanctioned here and citations are possible.\n\nPart of Makena State Park on the island\u2019s southeast coast, the beach overlooks a national marine sanctuary renowned for its sea turtles, dolphins, whales and tropical fish.\n\nGnarled trees behind the sand provide a modicum of shade and the cove is well protected for swimming.\n\nAdditionally, a drum circle and fire dancers entertain the crowd during Sunday sunsets.\n\nLittle Beach, Makena State Park, Makena Rd, Kihei, HI 96753, USA\n\nCap d\u2019Agde beach, France\n\nCap d'Agde -- an iconic nudist resort town in Southern France. Shutterstock\n\nSometimes called the \u201cNaked City,\u201d Cap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village is the world\u2019s largest clothing-optional beach resort, attracting as many as 40,000 guests on any given day during high season.\n\nVisitors are free to be naked wherever they want \u2013 restaurants and stores, post offices or banks, sailing their boat or lounging on the long public beach (where nudity is obligatory, even for those not staying at the resort).\n\nNon residents can stay overnight at the naturist hotel, camp ground or rental units.\n\nCap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village, Rond-Point du Bagnas, 34300 Agde, France\n\nIs Benas Beach, Sardinia, Italy\n\nSituated along Sardinia\u2019s west coast close to the town of San Vero Milis, Is Benas is known for its remoteness and pristine environment.\n\nThe idyllic beach has had a partially hidden naturist-designated area for the past two years.\n\nMayor Luigi Tedeschi of nearby San Vero Milis recently confirmed that local authorities had given the go ahead for couples to say their vows there au naturel at Is Benas in the future.\n\n\u201cWe have this beach, a place that lends itself brilliantly to naturism,\u201d Tedeschi told CNN. \u201cAnd then we thought, let\u2019s make a beach for weddings. If people want to marry nude, they can.\u201d\n\nThe beach is right next to the more famous Is Arenas Beach, while the ruins of Tharros, a Roman city dominating a thin peninsula, can also be found nearby.\n\nIs Benas Beach, Province of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy\n\nMpenjati Beach, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa\n\nMpenjati Beach was awarded official nudist beach status in 2014. Rajesh Jantilal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s only official nude beach \u2013 and perhaps the only legal clothing-not-obligatory strand on the entire African continent \u2013 is located in the Mpenjati Nature Reserve south of Durban.\n\nIts legal status was achieved in 2014, but this came with a list of prohibitions including no staring, no photography, no suggestive behavior, etc.\n\nLocal clergy and others continue to mount protests (legal and otherwise) against the naked designation.\n\nMpenjati Nature Reserve, Palm Beach, Port Edward, South Africa\n\nPlaya Zipolite, Oaxaca, Mexico\n\nZipolite Beach in Mexican is tolerant of nude sunbathing. Shutterstock\n\nLive your \u201cY Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u201d fantasies at the beach where so many of the scenes from the sensuous 2001 Mexican movie starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal were shot on location.\n\nPioneered by Mexican and American hippies during the 1960s, the strand stretches about two kilometers with rocky bluffs at either end, and is famed as a clothing-optional beach (although it isn\u2019t legal here.)\n\nWhile the main beach here is backed by budget hotels and cafes, a tiny sliver of sand at the eastern end called Playa del Amor offers far more privacy.\n\nPlaya Zipolite, San Pedro Pochutla, Oaxaca, Mexico\n\nMetsoke Dragot, Israel\n\nFloat nude in the warm, ultra-buoyant salty water and smear your entire naked body with soothing, mineral-infused black mud at this rocky beach on the western shore of the Dead Sea.\n\nPerhaps the only place in the Middle East where any kind of public nudity is tolerated, Metsoke Dragot is located about an hour\u2019s drive from Jerusalem and requires a short but rough drive along an unpaved road to reach the shoreline.\n\nPrimitive camping is aloud along the shore. The only nearby hotel and bar is the cliff top Metzoke Dragot Travelers Village.\n\nMetsoke Dragot, Highway 90, Dead Sea, Israel\n\nPraia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil\n\nNaturist beach Praia Massarandupi\u00f3 in Bahia. Fred Schinke/Flickr\n\nThe string bikinis on Copacabana may expose an awful lot of Brazilian flesh, but not nearly as much as this naturist beach along the Bahia coast.\n\nA two-hour drive north of Salvador, the nude beach is about a one-kilometer walk from the parking lot along the shoreline flanked by coconut palms, rolling dunes and very surfable waves.\n\nPraia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil\n\nSpiaggia di Guvano, Vernazza, Italy\n\nSpiaggia de Guvano has been popular with nude bathers since the 1960s. Shutterstock\n\nLocated on the gorgeous Cinque Terre, this primo Italian nude beach looks like something out of a movie (think \u201cSwept Away \u201d \u2013 the 1974 version directed by Lina Wertm\u00fcller.)\n\nAdding to the beach\u2019s mystique is the fact that it can only be reached via kayak or motorboat or hiking down a steep and somewhat treacherous trail that involves scrambling over rocks.\n\nGuvano is totally primitive, with no facilities of any kind, so bear this in mind when planning your visit.\n\nThe beach is also pebble rather than sand, but the water is clear, clean and gorgeous.\n\nSpiaggia di Guvano, 19018 Vernazza, SP, Italy\n\nVecaki Beach, Riga, Latvia\n\nEdged with pine trees, this Latvian beach is as calming as it is beautiful.\n\nBased close to the capital city of Riga and a relatively short walk from Vecaki train station, it\u2019s known for its shimmering waters, stunning sunsets and of course, its nudist section.\n\nThe zone, which happens to be the biggest nudist beach area in the country, includes a beach volleyball area that\u2019s a big hit with local residents.\n\nVecaki Beach, Selgas iela 20, Riga 1030, Latvia\n\nHaulover Beach Park, Miami, Florida\n\nThe most popular public nude beach in the United States, Haulover attracts more than 1.3 million bare bottomed people to its white sands and warm water each year.\n\nThe clothing-optional portion, marked at either end by picket fences, offers rental beach chairs and umbrellas, as well as lifeguards.\n\nGiven the stellar weather in south Florida, there\u2019s usually someone in the buff on any given day.\n\nBut the biggest crowds gather during National Nude Recreation Week in July and whenever Haulover is trying to set a new Guinness World Record for skinny dipping.\n\nHaulover Beach Park, 10800 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33154\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated and republished in May 2024.",

    "body": "Getty Images\n\nThe European Union on Thursday confirmed its decision to hike tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China \u2014 with one automaker issuing fresh warnings that it may have to raise prices as a result. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, announced plans for such levies in June after concluding in an investigation that producers of battery EVs in China benefit from \"unfair\" subsidization. On Thursday, European regulators confirmed that these duties, which have been lightly tweaked to range from 17.4% to 37.6%, will come into effect on Friday. The levies will affect automakers from Chinese giant BYD to, potentially, European brands that make cars in China, and even U.S. giant Tesla , which has a factory in Shanghai.\n\nThe EU's decision comes at a time when Chinese automakers have been aggressively expanding into Europe with competitively priced offerings, posing a threat to the region's top automakers, many of which have lagged behind in EVs. The European Commission says these carmakers have benefitted from \"unfair subsidisation.\" Automakers have already hit back at the tariffs. On Thursday, Chinese EV maker Nio said it is currently maintaining prices for its cars sold into Europe, but added that it \"cannot be ruled out that prices may be adjusted at a later stage as a result of these tariffs being imposed.\" A spokesperson for another Chinese EV upstart, Xpeng said on Thursday that customers who are awaiting deliveries of cars, or those who place new orders before the tariffs take effect, will be \"protected from any price increases.\" It did not comment on whether it would end up raising prices as a result of the levies. Geely declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. When the EU first announced the tariffs last month, Tesla said it will likely increase the Europe prices of its Model 3 vehicle. The EU has yet to say what specific level of tariffs Tesla will face, but noted last month that the U.S. automaker \"may receive an individually calculated duty rate.\"\n\nChina-EU negotiations\n\nThe tariffs that take effect Friday are provisional and last for four months. In that time, EU member states must vote on so-called \"definitive duties,\" which would last five years.\n\nwatch now\n\nChinese and EU officials have held several rounds of meetings to discuss the tariffs, with Beijing in June criticizing the EU's imposition of tariffs as a \"protectionist act.\" Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong said on Thursday that he hopes the two sides will \"meet each other halfway, show sincerity, speed up the consultation process, and, on the basis of rules and reality, reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible.\"\n\nChinese EV maker committed to Europe",

    "body": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year. STR | Nurphoto via Getty Images\n\nBitcoin's price slumped to around $57,000 apiece Thursday, hitting a two-month low after the U.S. Federal Reserve released minutes from its June meeting indicating the central bank isn't yet ready to cut interest rates. At around 2:30 p.m. London time, the digital currency fell around 5% in 24 hours to $56,837, falling below the $57,000 mark for the first time since May 1, according to data from crypto ranking site CoinGecko. Since then, bitcoin has pared losses somewhat and was trading at $57,932.57, down 3.4% as of 5:05 p.m. London time. Rival token ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, was down 5% at $3,120.\n\nIt comes after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday released minutes from its June meeting which showed officials are reluctant to lower interest rates until additional data shows inflation moving sustainably toward the central bank's 2% target. Higher interest rates are typically less favorable for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it dampens investor risk appetite. Bitcoin stormed to an all-time high of above $73,700 in March this year after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF.\n\nETFs allow investors to buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin without owning the underlying cryptocurrency. Crypto proponents say this has helped legitimize the asset class and make it easier for larger institutional investors to get involved. Since then, however, bitcoin has been trading within a range between roughly $59,000 and $72,000. Recently, the world's largest cryptocurrency has been pressured by news of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox readying the distribution of around $9 billion worth of coins to users, which is expected to lead to some significant selling action.\n\nwatch now\n\nOn Thursday, a small amount of bitcoin was moved from three wallets previously associated with Mt. Gox, according to Arkham Intelligence. The largest movement was for $24 worth of the cryptocurrency. It was not immediately clear if this transaction was made in connection with the Mt. Gox repayment plan. Elsewhere, the German government on Thursday sold roughly 3,000 bitcoins \u2014 worth approximately $175 million as of today's prices \u2014 from a 50,000-bitcoin pile seized in connection with the movie piracy operation Movie2k, according to blockchain analysis firm Arkham Intelligence . Arkham, which is tracking the German government's bitcoin wallet, said that the assets were moved to crypto exchanges Kraken, Bitstamp, and Coinbase, as well as an separate, unidentified wallet. \"These funds are likely moving to a deposit for an institutional service or OTC,\" Arkham said in a post on X.\n\nCan bitcoin still gain from here?\n\nHowever, analysts at crypto data and research firm CCData said in a research report Tuesday that bitcoin hasn't yet reached the top of its current appreciation cycle and is likely to hit a fresh all-time high. According to the report, historical market \"cycles\" have shown that bitcoin's so-called \"halving\" event \u2014 which cuts the supply of new bitcoins to the market \u2014 has always preceded a period of price expansion that can last between 12 to 18 months \u201cbefore producing a cycle top.\u201d\n\nwatch now",

    "title": "Hong Kong's IPO market is finally starting to turn around, consulting firm EY says",
    "body": "Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing celebrates the 24th anniversary of its listing on June 21, 2024. China News Service | China News Service | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 The market for initial public offerings in Hong Kong is set to improve significantly over the next five years, starting in the second half of this year, George Chan, global IPO leader at EY, told CNBC in an interview Wednesday. \"I think it will take a couple years to go back to the peak [in 2021] but the trend is there,\" Chan said. \"I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.\" High U.S. interest rates, regulatory scrutiny, slower economic growth and U.S.-China tensions have constrained Greater China IPOs in the last three years. EY said in a report that while the volume of IPOs and proceeds in the U.S. increased significantly in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago, mainland China and Hong Kong saw a sharp decline in listings. Many of the macro trends are now starting to turn around, which can support more IPOs in Hong Kong, said Chan, who is based in Shanghai. \"We are seeing a reversing trend,\" he told CNBC. \"We are seeing more of these [U.S. dollar] funds, they are moving back to Hong Kong. The main reason is that Hong Kong has already factored in these uncertainties.\" The Hang Seng Index is up more than 5% year-to-date after four straight years of decline \u2014 which was the worst such losing streak in the history of the index, according to Wind Information.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon\n\n\"Our HK cap markets team is very busy and has a strong pipeline for H2. We expect to see many HKSE listings,\" Marcia Ellis, global co-chair of private equity practice at Morrison Foerster in Hong Kong, said in an email Wednesday. Many companies that were waiting for a listing in mainland China's A share market have decided to switch to one in Hong Kong, she said. \"Previously [China Securities Regulatory Commission] approval was slowing things down but recently our team has gotten CSRC approvals pretty quickly.\" In June, China issued new measures to promote venture capital, and authorities spoke publicly about supporting IPOs, especially in Hong Kong. Investors and analysts said they are now looking at the speed of IPO approvals for signs of a significant change. Chan said another supportive factor for Hong Kong IPOs is that many of the companies listed in the market are based in mainland China, where economic growth is \"quite satisfactory.\" He expects consumer companies could be among the near-term IPO beneficiaries. \"As the economy slowly recovers, a lot of people in China are willing to spend,\" he said, noting that was especially the case in less developed parts of the country. Official national-level data have showed that retail sales are growing more slowly in China \u2014 up by just 3.7% in May from a year ago versus growth of nearly 10% or more in prior years. Also significant for global asset allocation, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks are pulling back from aggressive interest rate hikes. High rates have made Treasury bonds a more attractive investment for many institutions instead of IPOs. \"I would say if the interest rate can be further cut down, 1% maybe, that would have a significant effect on the IPO market,\" Chan said. Hong Kong IPOs raised $1.5 billion during the first half of the year, a 34% drop from a year ago, EY said in a report released late last month. Back in 2021 and 2020, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange saw nearly 100 or more IPOs a year raising tens of billions of dollars, according to the report. In comparison, mainland China IPOs raised $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2024 \u2014 a drop of 85% from the year-ago period, according to EY.\n\nwatch now\n\nBonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said during a conference last week that so far this year, the Hong Kong exchange has received 73 new listing applications \u2014 a 50% increase compared to the second half of last year. She is not related to EY's George Chan. \"The pipeline is building up nicely,\" she said, noting about 110 IPOs in total are in line for a Hong Kong listing. \"All we need is a set of good market conditions so these things get to launch and price nicely,\" she added.\n\nImproving post-IPO performance\n\n\"What we need is a strong pipeline,\" EY's Chan said. \"We need an interested investor with the money to invest, and we need a good aftermarket performance.\" Hong Kong IPO returns are improving. The average first-day return of new listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the first half of 2024 was 24%, far more than the average of 1% in the same period last year, according to EY. \"The aftermarket performance of Hong Kong IPOs has been doing quite good compared to the past five years,\" Chan said. \"These things added together are projecting an upward trend for the Hong Kong market [in the] next 5 years.\" Chan said he expects the number of deals to pick up in the second half of 2024.\n\nwatch now\n\nHe said those will likely be medium-sized \u2014 between 2 billion Hong Kong dollars to 5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($260 million to $640 million) \u2014 but added he expects better market momentum in 2025. Slowing economic growth and geopolitical uncertainty have also weighed on early-stage investment into Chinese startups. Total venture funding from foreign investors into Greater China deals plunged to $19 billion in 2023, down from $67 billion in 2021, according to Preqin, an alternative assets research firm. U.S. investors have not participated in the largest deals in recent years, while investors from Greater China have remained involved, the firm said in a report last month.\n\nU.S. IPO outlook",

    "title": "The five secrets to Ferrari\u2019s success as a luxury brand",
    "body": "In this article RACE-IT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nIn the world of luxury, Herm\u00e8s is arguably the gold standard. Its sales are growing double digits even as other luxury companies post declines or dramatically slower growth. Wealthy customers lucky enough to be anointed as Birkin-bag worthy can purchase a Birkin 25 for about $11,000 and flip it the same day for more than $23,000. Analysts predict Herm\u00e8s could surpass Louis Vuitton in revenue within the next three years as the world's largest luxury brand. Herm\u00e8s stock is up 13% this year, while LVMH shares are flat and Kering is down 18%. There is one luxury company, however, that has raced past Herm\u00e8s when it comes to growth and brand cache \u2013 Ferrari. This year, Ferrari for the first time surpassed Herm\u00e8s as the most valuable luxury company in the world as measured by stock multiple, which gauges growth and profit prospects. Ferrari's stock now trades at 50 times earnings, compared with 48 for Herm\u00e8s and 23 for LVMH.\n\nThe storied automaker, founded in 1947 by Enzo Ferrari as way to fund his race team, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange at $60 a share in 2015. It now trades at $410 a share. The company is valued at more than $75 billion \u2014 roughly 1\u00bd times the market cap of Ford or General Motors, which make millions of cars each year. Ferrari produced only 13,663 cars last year. Ferrari is not a traditional luxury company, of course. It makes cars and has a race team, a merchandise company, a car-restoration company and many businesses that bear little resemblance to a maker of $1,300 scarves and $800 sandals. Yet in a recent research report, Bernstein luxury analyst Luca Solca posits that Ferrari and Herm\u00e8s are similar, since both \"occupy the pinnacle of the pricing pyramid\" in their categories and are \"perfectly positioned\" to benefit from the surge in the global wealthy. To better understand what makes Ferrari a luxury brand, CNBC traveled to Ferrari headquarters in Maranello, Italy, to interview the company's CEO, Benedetto Vigna.\n\nGet Inside Wealth directly to your inbox The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Subscribe here to get access today.\n\nVigna is an unlikely luxury king. He spent most of his career at Geneva-based semiconductor maker STMicroelectronics, where he ran its micro-electromechanical systems and sensors group. He helped create the screen sensor technology used in iPhones, for example. His appointment to the top job at Ferrari in 2021 was a sign that technology would be core to the supercar maker's growth, and in a sense, the future of luxury. In an interview at the company's $200 million E-Building, Vigna talked about the upcoming electric Ferrari, its commitment to sustainability and current global demand for Ferraris. The main topic of conversation, however, was on what makes Ferrari a leader in luxury, and what lessons other companies and executives serving wealthy clients could heed from its rise. Here are five main takeaways:\n\n1. Play hard to get\n\nFerrari Purasangue SUV Adam Jeffery | CNBC\n\nAs Solca points out in his research note, Ferrari and Herm\u00e8s both \"sell less than the market would take.\" A lot less. Based on orders, analysts estimate Ferrari could easily sell two or three times its current production. Ferrari's allure was built on scarcity and exclusivity. Even if you can afford a Ferrari, with an average price of $380,000, securing an order is nearly impossible. The wait time for a Purosangue, Ferrari's pseudo-SUV, and other hot models is now up to three years, the longest in its history. Ask any Ferrari dealer about their biggest problem, and they'll say: \"Not enough cars, too many frustrated clients.\" But CEO Vigna said the scarcity is part of Ferrari's brand promise. \"We have to stay true to our founders strategy, which is to always sell one car less than the market demands.\" His strategy is to grow profit by making more on each car, rather than making more cars. \"We always want to push the quality of revenues over quantity,\" he said. Indeed, Ferrari's production increases over the years have lagged far behind the growth of wealthy potential buyers. In 2010, it produced 6,573 cars, which means over the past 14 years, production has doubled. Over the same period, the global population of billionaires has more than tripled (and so has the population of those worth $30 million+ and $100 million+). Vigna said seeing a Ferrari on the road should be like seeing a rare and exotic animal. The imbalance also gives Ferrari a unique position in the auto world: The cars usually appreciate in value over time. Vigna said that if clients have to wait for one, all the better. \"Waiting is part of the experience,\" he said. During CNBC's visit to the factory, a Ferrari customer took delivery of a new maroon 812 Superfast. He looked to be in his 70s or 80s. When he saw the car, and posed with it under the storied Ferrari entrance gates, his face lit up and he transformed into a 10-year-old on Christmas morning. Ferraris are special, because they are still special.\n\n2. Make emotion the driver\n\nThe Ferrari SP38 seen at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2022 on June 23rd in Chichester, England. Martyn Lucy | Getty Images\n\nAsk any Ferrari fan or owner what makes a Ferrari a Ferrari, and they might say the design, the engine sound, the handling, the power, the braking, or the 100 years of racing history behind that bright yellow badge. Vigna says a true luxury product is defined by one chief characteristic: emotion. \"Ferrari is a luxury company because it's a company that is delivering a unique product. It's connecting with the most inner part of people, the emotional side,\" he said. \"A luxury company is a company that is using technology, innovation, storytelling, heritage, everything, with the ultimate goal to feed that emotional side that we all have.\" Vigna said Ferrari will never produce vehicles that people simply need for transportation. \"When I get invitations to talk to conferences, I won't attend if I hear two words \u2014 utility or mobility. We don't make a useful product. We make an emotional product,\" he told CNBC. It's similar to what LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault refers to as \"desirability.\" It's not enough to make a high-quality product, or an expensive product or one with more features or functions. It has to tug at the heart.\n\n3. The art of pricing\n\nAn in-progress Ferrari at the supercar maker's E-Building in Maranello, Italy. Crystal Lau | CNBC\n\nBased on Ferrari's soaring prices, you'd think pricing is based on profit demands and Wall Street's obsession with margin growth. Yet Vigna said the base price for each model is actually set about a month before its launch \u2013 in an unusual process. \"The way we define price in our company is very simple,\" he said. \"One month before the car is ready for the unveil, we go on the track \u2014 me and several people \u2014 and we drive it for a day or a day and a half. And then with fresh emotion in our body, we define the price. It's me, the CMO and the CFO defining the price. We share the emotion.\" Clearly, those emotions are rising. The cheapest Ferrari in 2012 was the California, with a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $195,000. Today's entry-level Ferrari, the Roma, starts at $273,000, or 40% more. Ferrari is launching more limited-edition and special-edition cars that command far higher prices: The SF90 XX Stradale starts at around $900,000, and all 799 coupes and open-top Spiders were sold out when it was unveiled. The SP3 Daytona, with only 599 units, starts at $2.3 million. Perhaps the biggest boost to profits is personalization. Today's Ferrari buyers increasingly want custom paint colors, leather, fabrics, stitching, exposed carbon-fiber and other personal details that make it their own. Those personal touches can add anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000 to the sale price. Vigna said his \"value over volume\" strategy means Ferrari can grow profits in the double digits with only modest increases in cars made.\n\n4. The road to VIP status\n\nFerrari would never admit it, but dealers will tell you that customers have to work their way up a costly commercial ladder to get access to new Ferraris and especially limited editions. It's similar to the path Rolex buyers have to follow to eventually get a new Daytona, or Herm\u00e8s customers have to take to eventually get a Birkin. In short, you start by buying a basic (and sometimes less popular) model. Then you can buy a slightly more desirable model, or two or three. If you attend Ferrari events, show support for the brand, even join a Ferrari racing program, you can eventually become eligible for more expensive and even limited-edition models. Nearly three-quarters of all Ferraris are sold to existing customers. Which means starting at the bottom of the ladder is difficult. \"Ferrari and Herm\u00e8s reserve their most desirable products for their most loyal customers,\" Solca said. \"This in effect 'bundles' access and amps up desirability.\"\n\n5. Happy employees means happier customers\n\nWorkers at the new Ferrari NV E-building factory in Maranello, Italy, on Friday, June 21, 2024.

    "body": "With signs building that the labor market is at least slowing if not something worse, the June nonfarm payrolls report takes on added significance.\n\nPayroll gains so far in 2024 have totaled 1.24 million, down about 50,000 a month below the same period a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the report, to be released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, to show growth of 200,000, down from the 272,000 reported for May.\n\nIn historical terms, the pace of job gains is still solid. But there are signs bubbling underneath that conditions could be getting softer and possibly pointing at broader economic weakness down the road.\n\n\"This is a report that's coming at a point where there's a little more uncertainty about the economic landscape than there has been in a few months,\" said Nick Bunker, head of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. \"Specifically, I'm thinking more about the unemployment rate, which has been slowly trending up.\"\n\nThe jobless level in May did nudge higher to 4%, the first time it hit that threshold since January 2022, up from 3.7% a year ago. The forecast is for the rate to hold there.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a 4% unemployment rate would be cause for celebration, not concern. However, what is catching the eye of some economists is where the rate is now compared with where it's been over the past year.\n\nThe May rate was 0.5 percentage point above its 12-month low of 3.5% in July 2023, potentially triggering a recession indicator called the Sahm Rule. The rule has shown consistently that whenever the unemployment rate on a three-month average eclipses its 12-month low by half a percentage point, the economy is in recession.",

    "title": "'The Culper Ring': What George Washington's Spies Can Still Teach Us Today",
    "body": "NEWS ANALYSIS\n\nIn 1783, the American Revolutionary War ended. The 13 former British colonies, now the new United States of America, had won their independence \u2013 the freedom we cherish today \u2013 from the British king and his oppressive government.\n\nAmong the many thousands of American heroes who fought in the long seven-year war, there was one small group of men and women who history forgot.\n\nWhy? Because they wanted it that way.\n\nThe group was known as the \"Culper Spy Ring.\" It was a network of spies for General George Washington that successfully operated in and around New York City for five years without ever being discovered by the British.\n\nThe members of the ring knew the price they would pay if they were caught. Washington's first attempt at placing a spy on Long Island had cost Captain Nathan Hale his life. A graduate of Yale University, Hale was a schoolteacher. He had no training as a spy but volunteered anyway. Hale's mission to supply critical information to his commanding general failed. Within two weeks of volunteering for the assignment, he was dead, hanged by the British as a spy. Hale's body was left hanging for several days as a warning to other would-be informants. He was later buried in an unmarked grave.\n\n\n\n\"George Washington\" by Weidenbach, Augustus. (Image courtesy Library of Congress)\n\nHale's death touched Washington on many levels. He realized that more than just one man was needed to collect the military information he desperately sought. What he needed was a network of spies.\n\nIn November of 1778, Washington assigned Major Benjamin Tallmadge as his director of military intelligence. He had found his spymaster. But who were Tallmadge's informants? They were carefully selected from the friends the major had made while going to school on Long Island. The ring included Austin Roe, Caleb Brewster, Abraham Woodhull, James Rivington, and Anna Strong.\n\nThough Woodhull was Tallmadge's chief agent (code name Samuel Culper), Robert Townsend (codename Samuel Culper Jr.) was an important source who posed as a Loyalist coffee shop owner and merchant while working as a journalist. In his guise as a reporter, Townsend was able to obtain information from the British at social gatherings, according to Mount Vernon's website.\n\nThe Culper Ring successfully supplied information about British military strength and even possible plans to attack Washington's Continental Army.\n\nThe ring was also directly responsible for the arrest of Major John Andre, the British spy who had been plotting the takeover of the fort at West Point with his accomplice American General Benedict Arnold, the fort's commandant. Plans of the fort were found in Andre's boots when he was captured by members of the New York militia.\n\nBeing a good spymaster, Tallmadge kept the identities of his spies a closely guarded secret. After all, one loose lip, one slip of the tongue by anyone, could and would cost them their lives, and possibly even the lives of their families.\n\nAccording to MountVernon.org, the major developed a way to identify his spies with pseudonyms and invented a numerical substitution system to identify his informants rather than use names. Seven hundred and sixty-three numbers were used, with 711 denoting General Washington, 745 representing England, and 727 for New York. Tallmadge and his associates also wrote their messages using invisible ink.\n\n\n\nPortrait Miniature of Benjamin Tallmadge (1754-1835). (Image courtesy: Collection of the Litchfield Historical Society, Litchfield, Connecticut)\n\nThe identities of the Culper Ring were such a closely guarded secret that even Washington didn't know who they really were. As Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaegar noted in their New York Times best-selling book George Washington's Secret Six: The Spy Ring That Saved the American Revolution, \"several members of the ring (Townsend in particular) had been insistent that Washington never learn their names.\"\n\nEven after the war was over, the members of the ring kept their identities a secret. In April of 1790, Washington visited Long Island, including Setauket, where the ring had operated. The once-commanding general and now President of the United States reportedly visited with several members of the ring during his visit, but whether he knew who they really were, he did not say.\n\nOne member of the ring Washington personally wanted to thank was Townsend, who had risked his life almost every day for his country. But according to Kilmeade and Yaegar, \"Townsend never stepped out of the shadows to reveal himself to his commander-in-chief. It was a great honor to be sure, but not one that Townsend sought. He did not want praise or celebration; the greatest reward Washington could give him was simply a return to a quiet and unassuming life as a man subject to no king but God.\"\n\nTallmadge and the members of the Culper Ring took their secret to their graves. The public wasn't aware of the spy ring's existence until the 1930s. Townsend's identity as \"Samuel Culper Jr.\" was discovered in 1929 after a historian was going through Townsend's old correspondence. Rivington was confirmed as being one of Tallmadge's spies in the 1950s.\n\nEven today, there's still one spy who has yet to be identified \u2013 Agent 355. Some historians theorize 355 may have been a woman.\n\nOver the years, there have been numerous monuments and statues erected to Nathan Hale's sacrifice across the country. High schools, middle schools, elementary schools, university buildings, dormitories, a Revolutionary War fort, a U.S. Army installation in Germany, a U.S. Navy submarine, and even a town in New York bears his name. Hale was officially designated Connecticut\u2019s state hero in 1985.\n\nYet, there are no statues to be found of any members of the Culper Spy Ring. All of them deserve to stand alongside the many other heroes of the American Revolution. Under the direction of Tallmadge, the Culper Spy Ring risked everything to serve their new country in a war that had been deemed unwinnable by much of the world. After all, they were up against the British Army, one of the mightiest militaries on the planet at the time.\n\nAs Kilmeade and Yaegar wrote, \"They never sought credit, never received accolades, and never revealed the risks they took or the sacrifices they made to serve our country.\"\n\n\"The observation of (British) Major George Beckwith bears repeating: 'Washington did not really outfight the British, he simply outspied us!'\" the authors noted.\n\nSo what's the lesson Washington's spies can still teach us? The lesson of humility.\n\nThey protected one another by not revealing any of their wartime experiences, good or bad. They kept each other's secrets to themselves for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn this social media-driven \"Look at Me \u2013 Tell All\" culture that we live in today, it is a lesson from which we can all learn, and perhaps that in itself is their best epitaph.\n\n**Originally published July 4, 2021.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

    "body": "'Our Flag Was Still There': The True Story of the Family That Saved the Star Spangled Banner\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 As we celebrate our country's independence and freedom, there's perhaps no greater symbol than the American flag, often called the Star Spangled Banner. Today, the original flag, which served as the inspiration for Francis Scott Key and the National Anthem, sits in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. and how it got there is an interesting story.\n\nAuthor Tom McMillan details that story in his new book, Our Flag Was Still There: The Star Spangled Banner That Survived the British and 200 years \u2013 and the Armistead Family Who Saved It.\n\n\"The song, written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key, was inspired by the flag that flew at the Battle of Baltimore at Ft. McHenry,\" said McMillan in an interview with CBN News. \"After all of the fighting, Key saw it still proudly waving in the wind.\"\n\nMcMillan explained how the song is about Key figuring out who had won the battle.\n\n\"Through the mist he sees our flag,\" he added. \"Our flag was still there. There are four verses to that song and it's kind of sequential.\"\n\nAfter the battle, Commander George Armistead took the flag home as a souvenir.\n\n\"A complete violation of Army regulations,\" said McMillan. \"He stole the flag but it remained in the private possession of his family for 90 years. And no one really knew about it. That's why it exists today. His grandson gave it to the Smithsonian in the early 1900s.\"\n\nMcMillan's research even led him directly to some of Commander Armistead's descendants.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\n\n\n\"I was, fortunately, able to track down some direct descendants of George Armistead,\" said McMillan. \"When you're an author you just write them cold letters. You don't know if they're ever going to respond. Fortunately, I've had pretty good success and one called me, one whose name was George Armistead \u2013 called me right away. It's a little strange when you're researching George Armistead from 1814 to get a phone call from George Armistead.\"\n\nThe family invited McMillan into their Philadelphia home and what he found there went way beyond the flag.\n\n\"I went to the bathroom in their home and I came down their stairs and I saw some things on the wall where you hang high school diplomas and things like that. And these items were signed by John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison,\" McMillan recalled. \"They were George Armistead's original army commissions. And I said, 'You can't have these in your house!'\"\n\nThey also had an original portrait of the Commander. McMillan was able to connect them with the Smithsonian where they've since donated many of these national treasures.\n\nMcMillan says he loved digging into the research for this book.\n\n\"I think to do it you have to love the research just as much as the writing,\" he explained. \"Writing is fun, but it's learning. If you weren't curious like sometimes people will come up \u2013 this is my fourth book \u2013 'why don't you write about this, why don't you write about that.' You have to love it. You can't just get an assignment.\"\n\nFor him, this was no \"assignment.\"\n\nBefore writing this book, he served as Vice President of Communications for the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\n\"I had a great career,\" he said. \"I was in the media before that but I always said that, you know, for a lot of people sports is their escape from their job so when you work in sports you need an escape from it so history was my 'sports.'\"\n\nHe says his hope for this book is that it deepens readers' appreciation for history \u2013 and our country.\n\n\"One of the curators said when we were working on it the last time that they viewed it as a metaphor for the country,\" he said. \"It's tattered, it's torn but it still survives and the flag survives if the country survives.\"",

    "body": "'The Dam Clearly Has Started to Break': Several Dems Tell Biden to Drop Out as Trump Rises in Polls\n\nPresident Biden's political future remains uncertain in the wake of his shocking debate performance during which he appeared confused and stiff, often unable to communicate effectively. While calls for the president to bow out of the 2024 election from members of his own party increase, others, including Biden himself, say he's staying in and will win reelection.\n\nWednesday evening, 22 Democrat governors met with Biden at the White House to discuss his future.\n\nAfter the meeting, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore told reporters the governors were concerned about Biden's mental health.\n\n\"When you love someone you tell them the truth,\" he said. \"I think that we came in and we were honest about the feedback that we were getting. We were honest about the concerns that we were hearing from people.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden listens during a Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House, July 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said when Biden told the group he wants to stay in the race, they vowed to help him get reelected.\n\n\"President Joe Biden is in it to win it,\" she said. \"All of us said we pledged our support to him because the stakes could not be higher.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, during an all-staff campaign call, the president said he has no plans to drop out of the race, while the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeated that message to reporters.\n\n\"The President is clear-eyed and he is staying in the race,\" she said.\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden spoke to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries to assure them he plans to continue his race and capture the White House.\n\n\"He has done this outreach, he's having these conversations,\" she said. \"It is important to him to do so.\"\n\nHowever, Biden reportedly told at least two people in private that he's \"keeping an open mind\" about his path forward, and that his upcoming public appearances are critical to determining whether he'll remain in the race.\n\nCBN Political Analyst David Brody said it will be difficult for Biden to ease concerns about his mental health because his condition is likely to only get worse.\n\n\"The problem for Joe Biden here is that Democrats want to see him perform at a top level. And the reality is he's not at a top level,\" Brody said. \"That means he's going to have to be error-free in the next few weeks, let alone the rest of the campaign. And that's going to be a really hard climb for Joe Biden at this point.\"\n\nTexas Rep. Lloyd Doggett became the first congressional Democrat to publicly call for Biden's withdrawal, followed by Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva, possibly signaling the beginning of the end.\n\n\"I think what's happening now is that we're moving from the, 'Will he resign?' stage to the, 'When will he resign?' stage,\" Brody said. \"I think it's just a matter of time. At this point, the dam clearly has started to break. We've seen some elected congressmen, Democrat Congressmen, come out and say, 'No more, Joe.' I think that number will grow.\"\n\nA new poll from The New York Times and Siena College taken after Biden's dismal debate performance shows 74 percent of Americans believe he is too old for the job.\n\nThe gap between him and former President Trump has widened to six points, with Trump ahead 49 to 43 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, polls show Vice President Kamala Harris scoring two points higher against Trump, but still losing.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***",

    "title": "'With a Firm Reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence': Read the Full Declaration of Independence",
    "body": "The words of the Declaration of Independence reach across time to speak to the hearts of Americans even after nearly 250 years. Here's the entire declaration that led to America's freedom:\n\nWhen in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \u2014 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shewn that mankind is more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. \u2014 Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses:\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighboring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions, We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which the Independent States may of right do. \u2014 And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\n\nNew Hampshire:\n\nJosiah Bartlett, William Whipple, Matthew Thornton\n\nMassachusetts:\n\nJohn Hancock, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Robert Treat Paine, Elbridge Gerry\n\nRhode Island:\n\nStephen Hopkins, William Ellery\n\nConnecticut:\n\nRoger Sherman, Samuel Huntington, William Williams, Oliver Wolcott\n\nNew York:\n\nWilliam Floyd, Philip Livingston, Francis Lewis, Lewis Morris\n\nNew Jersey:\n\nRichard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, Abraham Clark\n\nPennsylvania:\n\nRobert Morris, Benjamin Rush, Benjamin Franklin, John Morton, George Clymer, James Smith, George Taylor, James Wilson, George Ross\n\nDelaware:\n\nCaesar Rodney, George Read, Thomas McKean\n\nMaryland:\n\nSamuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, Charles Carroll of Carrollton\n\nVirginia:\n\nGeorge Wythe, Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Harrison, Thomas Nelson, Jr., Francis Lightfoot Lee, Carter Braxton\n\nNorth Carolina:\n\nWilliam Hooper, Joseph Hewes, John Penn\n\nSouth Carolina:\n\nEdward Rutledge, Thomas Heyward, Jr., Thomas Lynch, Jr., Arthur Middleton\n\nGeorgia:\n\nButton Gwinnett, Lyman Hall, George Walton\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

    "body": "Teaching 10-year olds how to stage a full scale theatre production might not sound like an easy affair, especially when you are talking about teaching musical theatre to more than 100 children who signed up for the theatre class taught by Joan Aywaya and Warucu Kijuu.\n\nBut on June 21, 2024, we saw how these two teachers took a hands-on approach by staging the award-winning musical, Matilda the Musical, at Brookhouse School in Karen. One of the few schools in Kenya where theatre is one of the core courses in the curriculum.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019d asked our students if they had any preferred play to stage, nearly all of them said they wanted Matilda,\u201d Joan told the BDLife right after the Friday evening show.\n\nIn the programme (which most theatre companies today don\u2019t bother to create anymore) the two teachers (turned into co-directors for their annual productions) wrote a synopsis which clarified how the musical is based on the beloved children\u2019s book by Roald Dahl about Matilda Wormwood.\n\nMatilda is a bit like Harry Potter who\u2019d lived with abusive elders, only Matilda\u2019s adults were actually her parents whereas Harry\u2019s elders are related to his magical deceased mom. Even Cinderella\u2019s story follows a similar storyline of neglect, child abuse, and jealousy fueling the nasty treatment of our morally superior hero and heroines.\n\nThe synopsis doesn\u2019t make comparisons between Matilda, Harry, and Cinderella, but it does note that Matilda isn\u2019t alone in being abused at school. Her fellow classmates also get physically beaten (corporal punishment) by the \u2018tyrannical Head Mistress, Miss Trunchbuli who hates children and runs Crunchem Hall with an iron fist.\u201d\n\nOne of Matilda\u2019s biggest deprivations is the lack of books in her home (her parents refuse to buy them for her). Her biggest blessing is meeting the school\u2019s kind and carrying Miss Honey who recognises Matilda\u2019s keen intelligence, curiosity, and delight in finding a place where she can read books to her heart\u2019s content.\n\nMiss Honey is also mistreated by Trenchbuli. Witnessing these injustices finally inspires Matilda to stand up to the tyrannical head teacher who was ultimately tamed by \u2018a touch of magic\u2019, humility, and intelligence.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t too difficult to see how easily such a heart-warming story as Matilda could be understood by 10, 11, and 12-year-olds. But getting the pre-teens to understand all the nitty-gritty of staging a musical production might not be as simple. Nonetheless, putting that challenge is what the BDLife saw coming to life in Brookhouse\u2019s weekend show.\n\nJust sitting down with the cast and stage crew enabled students to see and learn how really good directors can behave. And when the directors are also helping their students understand the meanings behind the words, lines, and lyrics that they will sing, dance, and narrate, is even better.\n\nIt meant that teachers Joyce and Warucu were illustrating other aspects of effective directing. Some cast members may have already been involved with theatre through their churches so they too know how challenging learning lines can be, but that too is part of the teachers\u2019 task, to not only memorise their lines but also understand the meaning of those lines.\n\nIn a few cases, as the BDLife watched this fun production, it was easy to tell that not everyone spoke their lines with conviction although they knew their timing and kept their line up as in their chorus line. But when those few who didn\u2019t understand the significance of their lines charged swiftly through them, it wasn\u2019t always easy to hear what they had to say.\n\nNonetheless, it definitely didn\u2019t look difficult teaching students the joys of dancing, singing, and moving together as a giant ensemble or chorus line. In fact, the choreography was so good, I had to ask who the choreographer was since he or she wasn\u2019t mentioned in the programme.\n\nNormally, students who want to become professional thespians go to a college or university to learn all the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of musical theatre, including set design, costuming, lighting, sound, and even makeup artistry.",

    "body": "Adam Masava and Andew \u2018Crae\u2019 Chege are like birds of a feather despite their coming from very different backgrounds.\n\nOne comes from a comfortable Christian home outside Ruiru, Kiambu. The other was born and raised in Mukuru, a part of town not nearly so secure as Crae\u2019s. Yet the two are united in their love of art which transcends the material differences of class and culture, race and tribe, and even gender and age.\n\nCrae and Adam met at one exhibition opening. Crae started spending time at Mukuru Art with Adam, even as he was nearly finished being a fourth year student in the Fine Art department at Kenyatta University (KU).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I got my Bachelor [of Arts from KU], but I\u2019ve learned so much from Adam, especially about how to be a professional artist, stuff I wasn\u2019t taught at KU,\u201d Crae tells the BDLife.\n\nAnthony Chege\u2019s \u2018Desired Destiny\u2019 (left) and 'Boat analytical Transformation' at the Village Market rooftop gallery on June 15, 2024. Photo credit: Margaretta wa Gacheru | Nation Media Group\n\n\u201cKU took a more academic approach to art so I learned a lot about different materials and techniques of painting, but not about making art a professional career, which is invaluable stuff,\u201d he added.\n\nAdam himself wasn\u2019t at the Vibrant Hues exhibition at the Village Market rooftop since he had other shows popping up in various places around Europe. \u201cWe had been planning on having this exhibition for a long time, but when we were finally able to secure the gallery, we\u2019d still have to wait a year,\u201d Crea explained.\n\nBut Adam had mapped out his side of the exhibition well before he went overseas. Plus he had several of his most dedicated students looking after all aspects of the show, from surveillance and sakes to curatorial and administrative aspects of the exhibition. Several were even given a corner of the gallery to show their work.\n\nThere are several other things that Adam and Crea have in common. One is an attention to perspective and ways of enhancing different vantage points with different materials. Adam does it using different kinds of variegated cardboard to illustrate a more three dimensional view of Kibera\u2019s mabati rooftops, some in the foreground of the work, others behind crafted with a sort of flatter cardboard meant to be further background.\n\nCrae used to paint scenes in the slums somewhat similar to Masava\u2019s, only he didn\u2019t work with anything but acrylic on canvas, that is, until recently when he started painting on glass, or rather, the glass-like plastic called Plexiglas.\n\nBut not just one plate per painting. Let\u2019s talk about four plates per painting on which Crae paints on both sides of one plate. So for one painting, Crae uses four plates of flexiglass to create eight different paintings. It might be difficult to imagine how four plates of \u2018glass\u2019 can hang together well, particularly when the four are stacked and then sealed tight.\n\nIt\u2019s rather like what silkscreen artists do when they are printing several colours, one precisely on top of the other so that the finished picture is intact with the colours laid out just as the artist intended.\n\nCrae has half a wall filled with monochrome cityscapes that display his skill as a draftsman drawing assorted areas of Eastlands and urban life. So when we had gotten round to the far end of the show and saw his \u2018Desirable Destiny\u2019 we were taken aback. This was definitely a new Crae.",

    "title": "Developing an effective corporate hedging policy",
    "body": "To extend last week\u2019s article on hedging, today, I highlight why certain non-financial firms (read: commodity exporters, importers) need to develop a corporate hedging policy. As more and more companies suffer the consequences of being unhedged, having such a policy is becoming vital. I highlight the three pillars in building one.\n\nThe first pillar is a clear articulation of the firm\u2019s hedging objectives. These should be directly tied to the company\u2019s broader financial goals such as stabilising cash flows, hedging against short-term commodity price increases, managing foreign exchange risks or \u201clocking-in\u201d profit margins.\n\nSecond pillar involves defining the who and what of the policy. Who is responsible for the hedging policy? Who is going to be responsible for ensuring that the company adheres to policy? Who is responsible for developing, implementing and managing the hedging policy and accompanying strategies and procedures? A hedge committee, chief accountant, risk manager, etc.?\n\nWho is responsible for selecting appropriate counterparties and/or derivatives brokers/clearing members and what criteria will be used to evaluate them? And who is responsible for continuous monitoring and risk reporting?\n\nWhat type of transactions will be permitted? Forwards, futures, swaps, options? What indices will be permitted i.e. Dubai/Oman crude oil, ICE Coffee Futures, Singapore jet fuel, etc.? What resources (manpower, risk management systems, commodity market data, etc.) will said individuals and/or teams need to properly carry out their responsibilities? For example, the effectiveness of risk management metrics, such as stress testing, is essential for assessing the degree of vulnerability of the business under extreme conditions like a pandemic.\n\nIf the market trends unfavourably against the hedged exposure and the derivative fails to fulfil its hedging requirements (that is, does not offset the anticipated losses of the hedged exposure) or the chosen structure proves faulty as highlighted in my previous article on KQ, the primary purpose of the hedge is undermined. This situation could result in increased risk and a higher utilisation of the company\u2019s credit lines.\n\nThe third pillar deals with the practical aspects of executing derivative trades or the why, when and how. When and how will existing positions be reviewed to ensure that they are still appropriate given the company's risk tolerance, hedging policy and current market conditions? When and how will the various risks (market, credit, operational, regulatory) be measured and by whom? When and why will transactions be executed?\n\nHow often should the policy be reviewed and by whom? This is to guarantee that the company consistently aligns with its core hedging objectives and does not deviate from them.\n\nClearly there are a lot of issues to be explored when developing a hedging policy but by adhering to the three core pillars outlined above, companies can ensure that their use of derivatives is prudent, purposeful and perfectly tailored to their specific needs.\n\nA well-designed hedging plan will cut both risks and costs. Additionally, it allows management to focus on aspects of the firm in which it has a competitive edge by minimising risks that are not central to the core business.",

    "title": "Pop star Celine Dion chronicles her journey to stardom and declining health",
    "body": "There are few music pop stars in the world with the clout of Celine Dion. For more than three decades the Canadian singer has charmed the world with power ballads that are romantic signature tunes among the young and old, across the globe.\n\nThat is why her announcement in December 2022 that she was putting her career on hold after being diagnosed with Stiff Person\u2019s Syndrome (SPS) was greeted with shock and disbelief among adoring fans. The disease is a rare neurological disorder that affects one or two people in a million, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. It causes fluctuating muscle rigidity that can manifest in muscle spasms and falls.\n\nThe story of the 56-year-old superstar\u2019s battle against the condition is chronicled in the new documentary I Am Celine Dion which premiered on Prime Video on June 25, 2024.\n\n\u201cBefore I got hit by SPS my voice was the conductor of my life,\u201d she says with a smirk. \u201cI was following it, \u2018you lead the way, I\u2019ll follow you,\u2019\u201d she explains while gesturing as if to sing.\n\nThe film, directed by Irene Taylor, the Oscar nominated US filmmaker who admits that she hardly knew anything about Dion before this project, is an intimate portrayal of the singer, her family life and the rehabilitation from effects of her illness.\n\nIn a departure from the typical documentary format, the film relies exclusively on Dion to tell her own story, without accompanying talking heads. It traces her childhood love for music through grainy family home videos as she recalls signing in the kitchen at age 5 for her audience comprising her 13 brothers and sisters in a little town in Quebec.\n\n\u201cMy dream is to be an international star and sing all my life,\u201d she states in one of those childhood videos.\n\nThat shy girl with a distinctly powerful voice has risen to become a global icon over the course of 27 albums, selling 250 million records, winning five Grammy Awards and two Academy Awards. But that extraordinary success has come against the background of severe health challenges going back further than her public announcement last year.\n\n\u201cSeventeen years ago, I started experiencing voice spasms. I woke up and had breakfast and after breakfast my voice started to go up,\u201d she reveals. \u201cWhen I try to breathe, my lungs are OK, it is what is in front of my lungs that is so rigid because of SPS.\u201d\n\nShe dealt with that condition by pumping a variety of medicines into her system, 280-290 milligrammes of valium a day, according to her, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound dramatic but I could have died,\u201d she exclaims. \u201cI needed medicine to function. One more pill, two more pills, five more pills, too many pills.\u201d She had to explain to her fans why her shows were getting cancelled and also deal with rampant rumors about her gaunt appearance.\n\nThe most emotionally draining scene is when Dion experiences a full-body attack with her body jerking in spasms in the middle of a physio therapy session as the cameras roll. Apparently after watching the rough cut of the documentary, she was adamant that that portion be retained to show the debilitating effects of SPS.\n\nMusically, the story is interspersed with archival footage of an exuberant Dion performing on stage in stark contrast to her frail physical condition during the making of the documentary.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in control of what I love to do, I could record three songs a night,\u201d she states.

    "body": "I have much good fortune in my life, but in one respect I am unlucky: I live in the part of the country with the longest waiting times for driving tests, and I have been learning to drive.\n\nI began learning in 2022. In June 2023, I was test-ready. But when I tried to book my test, there were none available until mid-November, meaning I had to pay for six extra months of lessons so I wouldn\u2019t forget what I had learned.\n\nI failed that test \u2013 a stupid, nervous mistake. After time off to lick my wounds, I rebooked my test in January. The earliest test I could get? In late June 2024.\n\nThe result of all this was that by the time I went for my second test last month, I had spent at least \u00a31,000 on a year of unnecessary lessons. And I had the pressure of knowing that if I failed, I\u2019d have to wait another six months, and pay out yet again.\n\nI am not alone. In 2019, the average waiting time for a driving test at my local London test centre was 2.8 weeks. As of 4 March 2024, it was 24 weeks. Four years on from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused driving tests to be suspended, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), which carries out the tests in Great Britain (Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Driver and Vehicle Agency), has not recovered.\n\nWhile waiting times are coming down in Wales and Scotland, in England the situation is getting worse. In March 2022, the average waiting time for a practical car driving test in England was 14.5 weeks. In March 2023, it was 15.8 weeks. As of March 2024, it was 17.8 weeks, more than double the seven-week target set out in the DVSA\u2019s annual report.\n\nYou give them your personal information, they use it to abuse the system, and create a bigger backlog, and it goes on\u2019 Max Sobol\n\nBut according to the DVSA, I am the problem. Me and all the other learner drivers, for booking driving tests before they\u2019re ready. As a result, says the DVSA chief executive, Loveday Ryder, in a chiding blog post, \u201cthose who need to drive for their job, such as nurses and carers\u201d aren\u2019t able to access tests. If only we\u2019d stop being so irresponsible, NHS nurses and carers could go to work.\n\nThere is a straightforward way to determine whether this is true. If learner drivers booking tests when they aren\u2019t ready is causing the backlog, the pass rate would be down post-Covid.\n\nBut Guardian analysis of DVSA data reveals that the pass rate for learner drivers has actually gone up post-pandemic. In the five years from April 2014 to March 2019, the average pass rate in England was 47.8%, whereas post-Covid, from April 2021 to December 2023, it averaged 48.2%. England is no outlier: throughout Great Britain the pass rate post-Covid is higher \u2013 46.6% for April 2014 to March 2019, versus 48.9% for April 2021 to December 2023.\n\nSo if learner drivers aren\u2019t the problem, what\u2019s really going on at the DVSA?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like waiting for festival tickets,\u201d says Calu Malta, 27, who works for a non-profit organisation. In March, she woke up at 6am on a Monday morning, when the DVSA releases new tests, to book a driving test near her home in north London. Malta will have to wait six months for her test, in August.\n\nWhen a test becomes available, says Sue Smith, 62, a Newbury driving instructor who searches for her students, \u201cit\u2019s like having heart palpitations. You have to have the fastest fingers in the west.\u201d As a result, some learners are seeing their theory tests, which are only valid for two years, expire before they can pass.\n\nThere is a way to get a test faster \u2013 on the black market. Dozens of businesses offer fast-track tests, advertised through WhatsApp groups, websites and driving schools. The array of dates on offer is staggering. Fees range from \u00a3120 to \u00a3350 for tests that should cost \u00a362.\n\nView image in fullscreen Max Sobol: \u2018I suppose it\u2019s silly giving these companies your driving licence details, but it\u2019s the only way you can get a test.\u2019 Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian\n\nWhen faced with an impossible dilemma \u2013 spend hundreds on extra lessons, or pay touts \u2013 many decide that the second option is cheaper. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair,\u201d says Dan Cloake, a 35-year-old lighting technician from east London. In April, he paid \u00a3170 for a fast-track driving test through a WhatsApp group promising \u201cearly driving bookings\u201d. \u201cThis is a public service and we are having to pay this private tax.\u201d\n\nIn order to book his test, Cloake sent the touts a photo of his provisional driving licence. \u201cIt had my home address, my date of birth, quite a lot of personal information on it,\u201d he says. Is he worried about what the touts have done with his data, I ask.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Cloake slowly. \u201cA little bit. Now I am thinking about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a constant battle to keep on top of these bot things,\u201d said Ryder when giving evidence to the transport committee last July. Touts use automated software, known as bots, to reload the DVSA website until a test becomes available, then grab it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all above board,\u201d insists a Bradford-based driving instructor as he offers me a fast-track driving test slot for \u00a3200. \u201cNothing illegal.\u201d I\u2019ve called asking for his assistance in booking a driving test in Thornbury, where waiting times last year averaged 24 weeks. \u201cYou tell me when you need it,\u201d he says genially.\n\nHe\u2019s right. It\u2019s not illegal to sell a driving test for profit, although it is a violation of the DVSA\u2019s terms of use. But when you examine how the touts operate, evidence of illegality emerges.\n\nThere are two main ways to book a driving test: the public access system, open to the general public, and the business system, accessible to driving instructors and driving schools. On the business system, instructors and schools can book multiple tests, and, crucially, they can swap tests between different learners.\n\nBut in order to book a test, everyone, including instructors, needs a provisional driving licence, registered to someone who has passed their theory test. So how do the test companies do it?\n\n\u201cOn our system,\u201d boasts the director of one firm that offers fast-track test slots for between \u00a3190 and \u00a3250, \u201cwe have loads and loads of other licences, all looking for test dates. So what we\u2019re able to do, using their licence, is hold and reserve test dates, basically swap people in.\u201d\n\nThe smooth-talking Londoner says that one of the agencies he partners with to book tests has \u201c8,000 licences able to hold and reserve test dates for other customers. And as soon as one comes available, they\u2019ll hold it, reserve it, wait for the customer to confirm, then just swap them in.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Waiting for a driving test is like \u2018waiting for festival tickets\u2019, says learner driver Calu Malta. Photograph: macana/Alamy\n\nThis is how some touts operate: by reserving tests using other people\u2019s driving licences without their consent, in a probable violation of data protection laws, and then switching in the details of whoever buys the test. A Time Out writer recently wrote about having her driving licence used to book 53 tests without her knowledge. She\u2019d previously given her details to touts.\n\nFraudsters have even sent out phishing emails, purporting to be from the DVSA, asking driving instructors to share learners\u2019 licences. \u201cThe police don\u2019t have the resources to take proper action against fraud,\u201d says Dr Ben Collier, an online crime expert at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cFrauds like this are almost seen as not illegal.\u201d\n\nIn the driving instructor community, it\u2019s common knowledge that some instructors participate in these scams, to the frustration of their peers. \u201cInstructors are buying tests,\u201d says Simon Brady, 59, an instructor from Bradford. \u201cThey do it without their pupil\u2019s knowledge. They get their driving licence details and sell it to someone else.\u201d\n\nWhen Max Sobol, a 39-year-old film director from east London, paid \u00a3132 for a fast-track driving test in April 2022, he sent a photo of his driving licence over WhatsApp to the touts. Sobol failed his test in May and struggled to book another. Not wanting to pay for another black market test, Sobol\u2019s partner contacted the DVSA in July 2022 \u2013 only for the DVSA to tell her that Sobol actually had a test booked for that October.\n\nStopping the ability to swap tests means the scam will fall to pieces. It\u2019s the only solution. But the DVSA won\u2019t do it Simon Brady, driving instructor\n\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s silly to be giving these companies your driving licence details,\u201d Sobol says. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only way you can get a test. You give them your personal information, they use it to abuse the system, and create a bigger backlog, and it goes on. You\u2019re over a barrel with it.\u201d\n\nLike an arsonist who burns down your house, then sells you a tent, the touts offer a solution to a problem they created. But Ryder doesn\u2019t see the black market touts as fuelling the crisis, only as a symptom of it. \u201cThis problem,\u201d she told the committee, \u201cwill go away when the wait times come down.\u201d\n\nAs well as blaming long waiting times on the public, for booking tests before they are ready, the DVSA has pointed the finger at the people who carry them out. Driving examiners went on strike in December 2022 and January 2023. \u201cWe were seeing a steady improvement \u2026 until the industrial action part started,\u201d Ryder told the select committee.\n\nThe DVSA does not appear to have undertaken much soul-searching about whether it might have done anything differently. After scores of driving instructors left angry comments under a post about waiting times, the DVSA turned off comments on a subsequent post. \u201cThis is not about censoring your views,\u201d it said.\n\nYet the cause of the waiting times crisis is simple. There aren\u2019t enough tests to clear the backlog, and many of those that are available are being sold on the black market.\n\nAccording to Guardian analysis of DVSA data, as of 2024, the total Covid backlog for Great Britain is more than 1m tests. Since pandemic restrictions ended in 2021, the agency has made available an extra 212,000 tests, meaning that, at the current rate, it will not clear the Covid backlog until 2026.\n\n\u201cThe core of this problem is that there are not enough practical tests for everyone,\u201d says Rachel Newland, 46, a driving instructor from Reading. \u201cAnd the reason for that is that there is an examiner retention crisis. Until the DVSA acknowledges that, nothing will be fixed.\u201d Newland campaigns for the DVSA to increase examiner pay: a petition she set up currently has 1,883 signatures.\n\nView image in fullscreen Paul Weinberger, who has created a bot to get around block bookings by companies. Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian\n\nAs of July 2023, the DVSA had recruited 474 new driving examiners since March 2021. But about 15 examiners quit each month.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why. Examiners test seven students a day, work weekends for no additional pay and are often abused by members of the public. For all of this, they are paid about \u00a327,000 a year.\n\nAs civil servants, driving examiners cannot speak to the media. But conversations with well-placed sources reveal a stressed-out workforce. Candidates are angry at having to wait so long for tests, and take it out on them. They are being sent out with unsafe candidates in non-dual control cars. They are genuinely fearful of crashes. They feel frustrated and underappreciated. Another strike was narrowly avoided earlier this year.\n\nBecause the government determines civil service pay, the DVSA cannot put up salaries. But it could ask the government to make reselling tests illegal.\n\n\u201cStop the ability to swap tests,\u201d says Brady. \u201cThen the whole scam will fall to pieces. It\u2019s the only solution. But the DVSA won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe DVSA is resistant to this change because most driving instructors use the test-swapping service responsibly, to trade candidates who aren\u2019t ready for their tests with candidates who are. Yet those benefits are marginal, given the way the system facilitates an exploitative black market. We cannot swap GP appointments, or primary school places, or NHS operations. Why must we be able to switch driving tests?\n\nIn the absence of the one change that would work, the DVSA has reduced the amount of times driving tests can be changed from 10 to six, and implemented more anti-bot protections incorporating AI technology. It says it has created nearly 150,000 new tests and redeployed managers to help clear the backlog. It has a counter-fraud team that reports to social media networks if necessary. To date it has issued 231 warnings, suspended 687 accounts, and closed 570 accounts for misuse of the booking system, and removed 4,700 accounts that were not linked to approved driving instructors. It urges the public only to book their driving tests themselves, or through their driving instructor, to prevent their information being misused.\n\nIn January 2023 it made it a violation of its terms of service to sell driving tests for profit, or use driving licences without consent. But dozens of touts continue to flout these rules. And so English learners must choose between waiting six months for a test, or paying the touts and risk having their data misused. But there is a third way.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right that I should have to pay the black market for something that\u2019s a public service,\u201d says Paul Weinberger. In July 2022, Weinberger, who is 31 and lives in south London, needed a driving test, but his test centre had an 18.5-week wait.\n\nIt took Weinberger, who is a software developer, one evening to build a bot to search the DVSA website, and it took that bot two days to find him a test. \u201cIt was quite simple,\u201d he says. After he\u2019d passed his test, Weinberger uploaded details of the bot to Reddit. \u201cPlease be kind,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand do try to not make a business out of this.\u201d\n\nSince Weinberger built his bot, the DVSA has introduced stricter anti-bot protections. I meet Weinberger in a cafe to see if his bot still works. He instals it on my laptop and smiles as it begins reloading the DVSA page, looking for slots. \u201cIt still works,\u201d he says.\n\nOne woman had her driving licence used to book 53 tests without her knowledge. She\u2019d previously given her details to touts\n\nRyder has said that the DVSA plans to rebuild its booking system. If that removes the ability to switch tests, an exploitative industry will slam to an emergency stop. But the conditions that allowed it to start up will remain.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a lot of public services are broken,\u201d says Cloake. \u201cThis is just another example.\u201d Fourteen years since austerity began, we are used to non-functioning public infrastructure. We pay a tax to access basic services, such as booking driving tests, because we have no expectation of things getting better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m originally from Brazil,\u201d says Malta. \u201cIn Brazil, you have to pay to make things accessible. It\u2019s scary to see that happening here.\u201d\n\nAs for me, I passed my driving test. If I\u2019d failed, I wouldn\u2019t have waited another six months for a test. I\u2019d have fired up Weinberger\u2019s bot instead: my indefatigable friend, a middleman who\u2019s not trying to make money from my misfortune.\n\nWith data by Tural Ahmedzade",

    "body": "The pound held steady after exit polls showed Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour on track for a landslide election victory, as investors bet that a decisive win would bring stability to Britain after years of political and economic uncertainty.\n\nSince Rishi Sunak called the snap general election in the pouring rain outside Downing Street six weeks ago, financial markets have widely expected Labour to win a crushing victory. Opinion polls have shown the party heading for one of the largest majorities in modern political history.\n\nAnything other than a resounding Labour victory would have been a major shock after predictions among City traders for a night of relative calm on the currency markets, with dealing rooms across the Square Mile focused not on whether the party would win but on the scale of Starmer\u2019s landslide.\n\nAhead of official results expected in the early hours of Friday morning, the exit poll suggested Labour was on course to win a majority of 170.\n\nStarmer\u2019s expected majority is likely to solidify financial market expectations for a period of stability in British politics after years of turmoil under the Conservatives since the 2016 Brexit vote, when the shock leave outcome triggered a crash in the pound.\n\nAfter four prime ministers in five years, sterling has recovered from a record low of $1.03 in 2022, when Liz Truss\u2019s mini budget triggered a meltdown in financial markets that required the Bank of England to intervene to prevent pension funds from going bust. The pound had been one of the strongest-performing currencies across major economies in recent weeks in anticipation of the result.\n\nThe pound remained steady after the publication of exit polls on Thursday, with sterling trading unchanged on levels earlier in the day at about $1.27.\n\nLabour under Starmer has also shifted to the economic centre ground, aiming to distance the party from the more radical policies of Jeremy Corbyn after the former leader suffered a heavy defeat to Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories in 2019.\n\nAnalysts said a Labour majority below triple digits could have drawn a reaction in financial markets. Traders were also focused on whether Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party might win a sizeable number of seats, as a potential indicator of future political pressures on Starmer over the EU and immigration. The exit poll predicted that Reform would win 13 seats.\n\nStarmer has sought to maintain a cautious approach to economic policy after Labour\u2019s 2019 defeat, when Corbyn promised a far-reaching transformation of the economy, and after Truss\u2019s ill-fated economic experiment.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The stability that would be provided by such a win would mean investors can cross \u2018UK political risk\u2019 off their list of worries for the time being. The focus now shifts across the Channel to France, where Sunday night\u2019s election could have bigger ramifications.\u201d",

    "title": "Is Shein really worth \u00a350bn? Reasons to be sceptical are piling up",
    "body": "A stock market listing for Shein has been talked about for so long that the round number of \u00a350bn has become attached to this Chinese-founded fast-fashion retailer as a plausible valuation. It\u2019s probably time to ask: are you sure about that number?\n\nThe figure isn\u2019t plucked out of thin air, it should be said. Shein raised money from private equity backers last year at a valuation of $66bn, which is roughly \u00a350bn. But, since the company also raised a few dollars at a $100bn valuation the previous year, it has merely demonstrated the standard truth that valuations set in thin private markets can be volatile and are not to be relied upon. Translating a sketchy private number into a hard valuation on a serious public market is a different game.\n\nThen consider what has happened since those fundraisings. For starters, Shein has failed to get itself listed in the US, seemingly because of opposition from US lawmakers. London is now the likely destination \u2013 initial papers have been filed with the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 but the label of being a New York reject, you would think, would knock a few quid off the price.\n\nNow comes something potentially far more serious. The EU is drawing up plans to impose custom duties on cheap goods imported from China and seems to have Shein \u2013 plus the likes of fellow marketplaces Temu and AliExpress \u2013 in mind.\n\nThe threshold for the levy in the EU is \u20ac150 (\u00a3127) and was probably set at that level because of the administrative hassle of chasing small sums. But, given the explosive growth in such sub-\u20ac150 parcels, there is a fair argument that the retail market is now being distorted and it has become worthwhile for the authorities to pursue duties on packets now deemed \u201cde minimis\u201d. Why should Chinese-based retailers, dispatching orders in small packets to get under the duty threshold, while also enjoying subsidised postage costs in China, enjoy such an advantage?\n\nThe same argument is running in the UK, where the threshold is \u00a3135. Simon Roberts, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, this week called for loopholes to be closed for \u201csome of the businesses that aren\u2019t paying tax in the right way, so it\u2019s a level playing field for everybody\u201d. Absolutely right: the rules need a fundamental rethink.\n\nAn open question is how far Shein\u2019s business model would be damaged if custom duties had to be paid. Donald Tang, Shein\u2019s executive chair, has argued in the past that the firm embraces reform in the name of \u201cfair competition around the world\u201d and has claimed tax breaks are \u201cnot foundational to our success.\u201d Outside investors, one suspects, would want to see detailed evidence to support the latter claim. The core pitch to consumers is that the clothes are dirt-cheap; the customs duty advantage does not feel irrelevant.\n\nIn the meantime, the guessing-game on valuation must proceed on the basis of little detailed information. The Singapore-domiciled Shein drones on about how it uses AI to predict demand, how it ships to 150 countries and how it keeps waste to a minimum, but it is less forthcoming about financial performance.\n\nThe FT reported that it had seen a financing document showing $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) in profits for 2023 and roughly $45bn (\u00a335bn) in gross merchandise value, but audited numbers are what count in a listing document and for valuation purposes. Even before one considers the controversy around alleged labour malpractices, some scepticism is required around the \u00a350bn valuation. Shein is big, but it has barely started to explain its business meaningfully.",

    "body": "3d ago 15.34 CEST Energy commodity trading in muted reaction to prospect of Labour victory Jillian Ambrose The muted market reaction to the prospect of a Labour party victory in the UK\u2019s general election is evident even in energy commodity markets today, where traders are not expecting to be caught out by any surprises. \u201cElection results look quite certain,\u201d one trader told the Guardian. \u201cCommodity traders won\u2019t be working past 5pm.\u201d The potential for Labour\u2019s manifesto points to translate into price movements appears limited, according to Robbie Jackson-Stroud, an analyst at commodities data provider ICIS. Jackson-Stroud said that any policies designed to spur the development and construction of new energy capacity requires time to agree upon at a policy level, as well as planning and then construction. He added that \u201ccost constraints in the current climate are the driver of investment in renewable capacity, and a change of party does not shift that.\u201d But the commodity market\u2019s underwhelming response to a potential Labour government has had one exception: the UK\u2019s market for carbon credits. Traders have placed record bets that the price of UK carbon allowances, known as UKAs, would rise on the basis that a future Labour government would bring in tougher climate policies making it more expensive to pollute. \u201cUKA prices have already rallied on expectation of improved green policies and the possibility that the UK\u2019s carbon market may link with the EU market under a Labour government,\u201d the trader said. The benchmark UKA price climbed to highs of \u00a350 a tonne in the weeks after the election was announced, from lows of \u00a331 a tonne earlier this year. On Thursday the price reached an intra-day high of \u00a346.30 a tonne. Share\n\n3d ago 15.17 CEST The 4.2% drop in the Novo Nordisk share price this week has wiped nearly \u00a315bn off its market value, reducing it to \u00a3370bn. The success of its weight loss treatments has turned it into Denmark\u2019s, and Europe\u2019s, most valuable company. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis has also looked at the eye study. Whilst the paper in question does indeed suggest some correlation with a rare ocular event, the quality of the evidence is very low, the error bars are very wide, we note the lack of prior identification suggests this would be a relatively rare issue (far rarer than stats in this paper would imply\u2026) and the worst case scenario would likely be a further update to the label warning section \u2013 hardly a game-changer. As an aside, we also remain relaxed on the pricing outlook, within the context of the damage that has already been done by the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]. Share Updated at 15.17 CEST\n\n3d ago 15.01 CEST Shares in Novo Nordisk, and US rival Eli Lilly, have also come under pressure after Joe Biden attacked the company\u2019s pricing for weight loss drugs this week. The companies are charging \u201cunconscionably high prices\u201d that are above those paid in other countries, Biden wrote in an editorial with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders published in USA Today on Tuesday. If \u201cpharmaceutical companies refuse to substantially lower prescription drug prices in our country and end their greed, we will do everything within our power to end it for them,\u201d they wrote. Share Updated at 15.02 CEST\n\n3d ago 14.23 CEST Novo Nordisk shares fall 4.2% after eye study Shares in Novo Nordisk, the maker of the bestselling diabetes and weight loss injections Ozempic and Wegovy, have fallen more than 4% this week, after a study suggested that there could be a link between those treatments and vision loss. The shares are down 4.2% so far this week, but have somewhat recovered to trade 0.8% higher today. People who have been prescribed a weight-loss injection could be at a higher risk of developing an eye condition which can lead to blindness, the study found. The study, published yesterday, found that people with diabetes who were prescribed semaglutide, most commonly known under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic, were more than four times more likely to be diagnosed with an eye condition known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (naion). Naion is a disorder in which the arteries which supply blood to the optic nerve in the eye become blocked. The condition can lead to loss of eyesight due to the optic nerve being deprived of oxygen and subsequently damaged. There is no known treatment for the condition, which affects 10 out of 100,000 people in the general population. Weight-loss jabs may be linked to condition that can cause blindness, study finds Read more Jakob Westh Christensen, market analyst at eToro said Considering that over 50% of Novo Nordisk\u2019s sales are attributed to these two blockbuster drugs and with a promising projected growth trajectory, any significant issues with the drugs could pose a threat to earnings and stock prices. However, the relatively minor market reaction indicates that investors are not overly concerned about this initial study. With a high valuation at nearly 40 times pprice/earnings, it is evident that the market has great expectations for Novo Nordisk\u2019s earnings growth in the year ahead. This growth is largely based on their GLP-1 diabetes and weight-loss treatments, which are currently under scrutiny. This growth journey is supported by yet another uplift to management\u2019s 2024 outlook in connection with Q1-results, which now expects operating profit to grow 22-30%. However, it is important to note that this study is relatively small and has limited statistical power. The findings do not prove that the medications caused the eye complications, which are commonly associated with diabetes. To establish any connection properly, a much larger study must be conducted. As retail investors who hold Novo Nordisk stock, it is advisable to monitor this situation closely. Any significant threat to these highly successful drugs would constitute a significant setback to Novo Nordisk\u2019s growth journey. Share Updated at 15.11 CEST\n\n3d ago 13.51 CEST Russ Mould at AJ Bell has also looked at the medical equipment maker Smith & Nephew, Andy Murray\u2019s artificial hipmaker, which is leading FTSE 100 gains here in London. The shares jumped more than 8% after the activist investor Cevian Capital, a Swedish investment firm, disclosed a stake of around 5%. Activist investors often circle a struggling company so the news Sweden\u2019s Cevian has taken a stake in medical devices firm Smith & Nephew shouldn\u2019t come as a huge surprise. Cevian has previously taken positions in UBS, Vodafone and Aviva in an attempt to force change and the case for doing so at Smith & Nephew is presented by a near-40% decline in the share price over the last five years. Ian Cowie, columnist at the Sunday Times and interactive investor, said on X: Bargain Britain: Activist Investor Cevian Takes Stake in Smith & Nephew, Andy Murray\u2019s artificial hip-maker. Share price jumps for joy! https://t.co/MdiYfDwi4F \u2014 Ian Cowie (@iancowie) July 4, 2024 The positive share price reaction to Cevian taking a position in Smith & Nephew demonstrates the market thinks an outside catalyst for a shake-up of the business would be no bad thing. The company was severely affected by the pandemic as elective procedures like hip and knee replacements were cancelled, reducing demand for its orthopaedic products. Lockdown also hit the company\u2019s supply chain, as it did for many businesses. However, its post-Covid recovery has been faltering and an improvement plan announced in 2022 has not yet resulted in a material improvement in earnings and profitability. This hasn\u2019t been helped by a weak showing in the US market. Cevian is likely to hold management\u2019s feet to the fire and may look for more ambitious targets than set out under the existing improvement plan. It could also push for a rationalisation of the company\u2019s portfolio, which encompasses sports medicine and wound care alongside orthopaedics.

Photograph: Stephen Dwyer/Alamy Share Updated at 14.13 CEST\n\n3d ago 13.47 CEST Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, has looked at today\u2019s market moves. The FTSE 100 index has gained 80 points to 8251, up nearly 1% on the day, while European shares are also pushing higher. France\u2019s CAC has climbed 0.8% ahead of the second round of elections on Sunday. The FTSE 100 made a strong start on election day but its gains had far more to do with events on the other side of the Atlantic. Broad-based gains across the index followed weak jobs data from the US and a soft reading from the country\u2019s services sector. This was taken as an indication the Federal Reserve may start cutting interest rates sooner rather than later, with the labour market closely watched by Jerome Powell and his colleagues. The dollar fell which, along with the shifting rate expectations, helped power Asian markets to big gains, with one broad-based Asian index reaching its highest level in more than two years. Dominant regional name Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company traded above one thousand Taiwanese dollars for the first time. Closer to home, there was some relief that mainstream parties appeared to be mounting a concerted effort to thwart the far-right Rassemblement National\u2019s hopes of gaining a majority in the French parliament. Share\n\n3d ago 13.44 CEST Daniela Sabin Hathorn, senior market analyst at the trading platform Capital.com, said if we get a government change after 14 years of Tory leadership as suggested by opinion polls, \u201cthe market reaction is likely to be slightly muted given the outcome is mostly priced in\u201d. The majority of the momentum will come from investors\u2019 perception that the Labour Party can keep to its pledge to keep a lid on public spending and manage the national debt while putting the country back on the path towards stable economic growth. In particular, the plans to increase the supply of housing could benefit FTSE 100-listed housing stocks (Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Berkeley Group, etc.). Turning to the pound, she said: Barring any surprises which could bring volatility to markets, the pound may attempt to build on the pre-election rally of the last two days. But it is likely that it encounters resistance up ahead, especially as the focus remains on the Bank of England and its policy mandate, which has given no clear signs of when it will be able to start cutting rates. Markets are hopeful of a September start, but ongoing concerns about wage pressures in the services sector are keeping the central bank from making a move just yet. How these policy expectations evolve will likely have a bigger impact on the pound in the coming weeks than the election. Overall, the momentum in UK assets should not change much after the UK general election if things go as planned. As we\u2019ve seen from the political turmoil in France, the less political friction there is the better the market will react. There is no denying that a new government will face significant challenges up ahead and that can weigh on UK assets further down the line, but for now, a seemingly calm election should anchor UK stocks and keep the pound relatively calm. Share\n\n3d ago 13.03 CEST UK employers scale back expected wage growth, Bank of England says Employers in the UK expect their wage bills to grow more slowly over the coming 12 months, according to a survey that should give the Bank of England more confidence to cut interest rates in the next few months. The central bank\u2019s own Decision Maker Panel survey showed anticipated year-ahead wage growth fell by 0.3 percentage points to 4.2% in the three months to June. It was the lowest reading since the survey started in May 2022. The official measure of earnings growth has been too high for policymakers\u2019 liking, and also fed into stubbornly high services inflation. But this survey suggests that wage growth could cool in the coming months. Share\n\n3d ago 12.34 CEST EU trade chief: no basis for China to retaliate to new EV tariffs There is no basis for China to retaliate, as the European Union prepares to impose fresh tariffs of up to 37.6% on imports of electric vehicles made in China, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said today, in an interview with Bloomberg News. The EU tariffs, which range between 17.4% and 37.6%, will apply from tomorrow, according to EU officials. They are aimed at stemming what European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has described as a flood of cheap Chinese-made EVs built with state subsidies. However, there is a four-month window during which the duties are only provisional and intense talks are expected to continue between the two sides. At the end of the period, the Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, could impose \u201cdefinite duties\u201d that typically apply for five years, on which EU members would vote. Dombrovskis said: Our aim is to\u2026 ensure fair competition and level playing field. Therefore, once again, we do not see any basis for retaliation. Those talks with China are ongoing and indeed should a mutually beneficial solution emerge, we can also find ways not to apply at the end of the day the tariffs. The provisional rates are almost exactly those announced by the Commission on 12 June. Beijing said at the time that it would take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to safeguard China\u2019s interests. These could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of European products such as cognac and pork. EU to put tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese electric vehicles as trade war looms Read more Germany\u2019s Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s biggest carmaker, is opposed to the tariffs. It said: The timing of the EU Commission\u2019s decision is detrimental to the current weak demand for BEVs [battery electric vehicles] in Germany and Europe. The negative effects of this decision outweigh any benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry. The Volkswagen Group is confidently accepting growing international competition, including from China, and sees this as an opportunity \u2013 this also benefits our customers. The owner of the Jeep, Fiat and Vauxhall brands, Stellantis, has also come out against the proposed tariffs. Its chief executive, Carlos Tavares, has criticised the duties and said the world\u2019s fourth biggest carmaker preferred to \u201cfight to stay competitive\u201d. The Shanghai-based electric carmaker Nio said: At this stage, Nio maintains the pricing of its current models in its European markets. however, it cannot be ruled out that prices may be adjusted at a later stage as a result of these tariffs being imposed. Despite these developments, Nio is fully committed to the European market: we believe in fostering competition and consumer interest, and we hope to reach a resolution with the EU before definitive measures are enforced in November.

    "body": "The British banking sector has called for the next government to penalise startups that take state aid and then list abroad amid concerns about young companies choosing foreign stock exchanges over London.\n\nUK Finance suggested subsidies and tax breaks could be clawed back, arguing in a paper published this week that companies in receipt of government help should have \u201ca two-way commitment\u201d.\n\nBritish businesspeople and City grandees have said for several years that London\u2019s stock market is in decline relative to other exchanges, notably in the US, where some fast-growing companies have said it is easier to attract investments.\n\nRecent departures from the London Stock Exchange have included the building materials company CRH, the betting company Flutter and the plumbing products company Ferguson. Perhaps most galling for the LSE, however, was the failure to attract the huge flotation of the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm, which plumped for New York despite the personal lobbying of Rishi Sunak.\n\nIn a paper co-written by Global Counsel, the lobbying consultancy set up by the former Labour business minister Peter Mandelson, UK Finance suggested commitments to stay in the UK in exchange for government support could help to arrest the movement of companies abroad.\n\n\u201cThe government should also consider ways in which an expanded set of taxpayer-funded supports for early-stage growth companies involve a two-way commitment and would become repayable in part or full if a recipient ultimately chooses to list, or move valuable operations, outside the UK,\u201d it wrote.\n\n\u201cWhere a UK company chooses to join public markets or locate is a choice for the company. However, there is a strong case for linking taxpayer supports to future commitments to using UK public markets and operating in the UK.\u201d\n\nRegulators, politicians and executives have prescribed various remedies for the perceived exodus. The Financial Conduct Authority last year unveiled sweeping reforms to make it easier for startup founders to keep controlling stakes, apeing the US.\n\nThe chief executive of the LSE, Julia Hoggett, argued last year that UK companies were not on a \u201clevel playing field\u201d because British asset managers tended to vote against larger, US-style pay packages.\n\nConor Lawlor, the managing director for capital markets and wholesale policy at UK Finance, said: \u201cWe want to see UK companies grow and be hugely successful. We also want to bolster our capital markets and the number of companies that choose to list on UK markets.

Where a UK company chooses to list will of course always be a choice for that individual company.\u201d\n\nThe banking body also suggested tapering early-stage government support for startups, rather than cutting it off abruptly when they reach a certain size, and said there could be benefits to making it easier for pension funds to invest in unlisted UK companies.\n\nThere were 2,101 companies listed on London\u2019s main market in 2003, but that figure has fallen to 1,022, according to LSE data.",

    "title": "Why French election results matter more to financial markets than the UK vote",
    "body": "Forget the UK general election.\n\nThe poll that financial markets will be watching most closely over the next few days is the second round parliamentary 'run-off' in France this Sunday.\n\nThe French poll is unpredictable, to say the least.\n\nThe first round of voting last week raised the prospect of a hung parliament and prompted a relief rally in French assets on Monday this week.\n\nMarkets would prefer a hung parliament because Marine Le Pen's far-right Rassemblement National (RN or National Rally) and the New Popular Front (NPF) - an alliance of the far-left France Unbowed, the Greens and the Socialists - both want to raise taxes and public spending aggressively.\n\nBut uncertainty remains in the air as the NPF and French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble (Together) alliance scramble to prevent a triumph for RN.\n\nWhat next in French voting?\n\nUnder French electoral rules, where no candidate won outright in the first round of voting, a second round \"run-off\" is held between the two best-placed candidates and any other candidates who garnered more than 12.5% of the vote during the first round. Whoever gets the most votes in the second round wins.\n\nAccordingly, both the NPF and Ensemble have been standing down the majority of candidates in seats where they finished third last time - in the hope their supporters will vote tactically to keep out the RN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 14:41 French elections: Who are National Rally?\n\nLe Monde, the second best-selling newspaper in France, reported yesterday that 224 candidates have withdrawn.\n\nTactical questions\n\nThe tactic may not work, however, not least because the conservative Les Republicains - the party of former presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy and which won 10.2% of the votes last Sunday - has given no such guidance to its supporters and could thus split the anti-RN vote.\n\nMoreover, a lot of liberal and conservative voters will be reluctant to vote for the NPF candidate when they come from France Unbowed, led by the 72-year-old left-wing firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who is often characterised as a French version of Jeremy Corbyn and who put together the alliance.\n\nEdouard Philippe, Mr Macron's former prime minister, has urged Ensemble's candidates to step down where they were in third place during the first round and get behind centre-right or centre-left candidates - but not candidates from RN or France Unbowed.\n\nA nervous watch\n\nLe Monde estimates that, of the remaining contests, some 409 will now be decided by a two-way duel. There are 89 three-way contests and two four-way battles.\n\nWith the RN expected by pollsters to get anything between 250 and 300 seats in the National Assembly - 289 is required for a majority and it came first in 296 seats in the first round - that has left markets watching nervously.\n\nEver since Mr Macron stunned Europe on 10 June by calling a parliamentary election, after Ensemble suffered a spanking in the European parliamentary election, investors have been rattled by the prospect of either RN or the NPF winning a parliamentary majority.\n\nFollow Sky News on WhatsApp Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Tap here\n\nMarket reactions so far\n\nThe CAC-40, the leading French stock index, fell by more than 6.5% between 10 June and last Friday - the final day before the first round of voting.\n\nSome individual stocks have fallen by more, though, with the banks Societe Generale and Credit Agricole down 10% and 7% respectively since Mr Macron called the election. The construction-to-telecoms conglomerate Bouygues has also fallen by 10% and Vinci, the construction and infrastructure services group which owns the UK civil engineer Taylor Woodrow, is down by more than 7.5%.\n\nThere has also been a sell-off in French government bonds - reflecting concerns that a high-spending RN or NPF government would increase borrowing.\n\nThe yield (bond yields rise as the price falls) on 10-year French government bonds jumped from 3.118% on the day before Mr Macron called the election to as much as 3.373% on Tuesday this week.\n\nAnd the premium that investors demand for holding 10-year French government bonds over their German equivalent surged from 47.61 basis points (0.4761%) before Mr Macron called the election to as much as 85.2 basis points (0.852%) last Friday - a sharp and pronounced move highlighting the anxiety of investors and taking the spread to its widest in 12 years.\n\nA French-style mini-budget moment?\n\nIt has led some investment analysts to speculate that France could suffer its own mini-budget moment - where bond investors sell the government's debt for fear of extra borrowing surging out of control.\n\nThe uncertainty has even spilled over to the Euro, which has fallen from $1.09 just before the European elections to as low as $1.067 in the days after Mr Macron called the snap poll, although it has since rallied to around $1.079.\n\nSome analysts now argue French assets represent good value, assuming the second round of voting produces a hung parliament or a modest majority for the RN, which is regarded as a more market-friendly outcome than a victory for the NPF.\n\nMarina Zavolock and Regiane Yamanari, strategists at Morgan Stanley, told clients today: \"We believe the two key remaining French election scenarios - no majority and RN absolute majority - would both ultimately be followed by a recovery in French and wider-European equities indices.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nAlready existing concerns\n\nBut there are still widespread concerns - and so serious are they that the European Central Bank has even faced questions this week at its annual Central Banking Forum in Sintra, Portugal, over whether it would be prepared to intervene in the markets, if necessary, to prop up French government bonds.\n\nFrance is already under a so-called \"excessive deficit procedure\" with the European Commission for running a budget deficit of 5% of GDP - well ahead of the 3% limit led out by the Maastricht Treaty. That was already putting it on a potential collision course with Brussels in the event of a victory for either the RN or the NPF.\n\nSome leeway 'because it's France'\n\nFrance has traditionally enjoyed a certain amount of leeway from Brussels over running excessive deficits because of its importance to the eurozone - where it is the second-largest economy behind Germany.\n\nThat attitude was famously summed up by Jean-Claude Juncker, a former commission president, when he was asked in 2016 why France was not forced to play by the same rules as, say, Greece or Portugal: \"Because it's France.\"\n\nBut Reuters reported today that some of the ECB's governors are expected to insist that the central bank should not intervene until Paris has thrashed out some kind of agreement with the Commission over its deficit.\n\nHowever, during a panel discussion, Christine Lagarde, the ECB president, indicated the ECB could intervene and especially if a sell-off in French government debts spread contagion to other Eurozone debt - just as her predecessor, Mario Draghi, did in 2012.\n\nMs Lagarde said: \"The European Central Bank has to do what it has to do. Our mandate is price stability. Price stability is obviously relying on financial stability, and we are attentive to that.\"\n\nSo markets have been put on notice.\n\nThe bigger picture, though, is that bond investors will continue to have concerns about the French deficit whatever the outcome on Sunday.",

    "title": "Could the 'flying piano' help transform air cargo?",
    "body": "Could the 'flying piano' help transform air cargo?\n\n2 days ago By Michael Dempsey , Technology Reporter Share\n\nAerolane Dubbed the \"flying piano\", Aerolane's test aircraft is surfing air currents\n\nUS start-up Aerolane is seeking the secret to airborne surfing. Geese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them. At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo. Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft. Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft. Their latest test aircraft is known as the \u201cflying piano\u201d because of its poor gliding characteristics. Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes. Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line. They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead.\n\nAerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel. One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously. The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft\u2019s engines. In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls \u201ca combination of gliding and surfing\u201d. The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic. Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350\u2019s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn.\n\nAirbus Airbus has experimented with flying a jet in the wake of another to conserve fuel\n\nMr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years\u2019 experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi, a veteran of Amazon\u2019s drone delivery project, on the basis that \u201cthere has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft\". The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations. For instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population. Aerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by.\n\nAerolane Aerolane hopes that a glider something like this might one day carry air freight\n\nMr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project. \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged outside advisors to be devil\u2019s advocates,\" he adds. He says big freight businesses are interested in anything that allows them to cut the cost per delivery. On top of the cost of fuel, air freight firms also have to think about jet engine emissions and a shortage of pilots. James Earl, a former RAF helicopter pilot and aviation consultant, thinks Mr Graetz may just be onto something. \u201cIt stands to reason that gains can be had by slipstreaming and combining efforts in the sky. And any innovation in the cargo space is good.\u201d However, he cautions that public acceptance of unpowered cargo flights over built-up areas is another thing entirely. \u201cIt should have a good gliding range to get to a landing spot in the event of a major failure by the tow plane. Whether that can be effectively communicated to the public is another matter though.\u201d\n\nFred Lopez Fred Lopez was initially sceptical about Aerolane's prospects",

    "title": "Chinese electric car makers hit with new European Union tariffs",
    "body": "EU hits Chinese electric cars with new tariffs\n\n3 days ago By Jo\u00e3o da Silva , Business reporter Share\n\nGetty Images MG owner SAIC is one the car makers hardest hit by the new tariffs\n\nThe European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, as Brussels takes action to protect the bloc's motor industry. The new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 17.4% to 37.6%, which is on top of a 10% duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from China. This could raise the price of EVs across the EU, making them less affordable for European consumers. The move is also a major blow for Beijing, which is already in a trade war with Washington. The EU is the largest overseas market for China\u2019s EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy. EU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by \"unfair subsidisation\", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc. China has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports. The new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. They are not likely to be imposed until later this year. So who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute? It is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels. By imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU\u2019s decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU. The number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E). Patryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: \"I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46.\" T&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027. But not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs.\n\nWinners and losers\n\nThey were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. SAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4. \"The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,\" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. For Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: \"I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty.\" For China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU. That is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will \"give the automaker an advantage in the European market\". Lu\u00eds Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car. But, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because \"other brands would also be affected\".\n\nPortuguese executive Lu\u00eds Filipe Costa chose a BYD Seal over Western brands\n\nGeely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%. According to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will \"still export to the EU profitably\" but \"its profits will be significantly reduced.\" Other firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU. Those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%. US-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation. Still, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs. Last year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y. Mr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen. \"Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,\" Mr Koopmann says. \"If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision.\"\n\nLocalising production\n\nWhile some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe. The hardest hit \"will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,\" Rhodium says. \"The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault.\" In other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers. There is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties. Work on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year. Chinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona. And, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe. \"It\u2019s a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,\" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility. \"The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.\"",

Blast Furnace 5 (BF5) had been operating since 1959, but will shut as part of Tata Steel UK\u2019s restructure. Port Talbot\u2019s other furnace will end production of liquid iron in September ahead of the construction of a greener electric arc furnace next year. Nearby residents have been warned about the sights and sounds connected to the cooling of BF5.\n\nTata Steel UK The furnace had undergone major rebuilding and renovation works to keep operating\n\nTata Steel UK Blast Furnace 5 in 1958, a year before it began producing liquid iron\n\nEarlier this week, engineers began altering the raw ingredients that are poured into the blast furnace in order to prepare for decommissioning. Plumes of steam and some whooshing sounds were expected to be heard ahead of the final tapping of liquid iron on Thursday evening or Friday morning. When the furnace began life in May 1959, it produced 11,800 tonnes a week, peaking in 2009 when it was producing more than 57,000 tonnes a week. Tragedy struck in November 2001 when an explosion killed three steelworkers and severely injured 12 others. Tonnes of molten iron burst from the furnace as the explosion lifted the top of the massive structure into the air. A report blamed the cause of the disaster on water that had come into contact with hot materials in the furnace.\n\nFamily photos Stephen Galsworthy, Andrew Hutin and Len Radford died in the 2001 explosion\n\nThe explosion claimed the lives of Stephen Galsworthy, who was 25, Andrew Hutin, 20, and Len Radford, 53. A \u00a365m rebuilding of the furnace, and upgrades since, had allowed it to continue producing the liquid iron required for Port Talbot\u2019s steelworks. Its closure comes amid a vast restructure of Tata Steel UK\u2019s operations. While BF5 will close this week, Blast Furnace 4 will shut in September and will end Port Talbot\u2019s ability to produce liquid iron from ore.

    "title": "Gatwick Airport: Holidaymakers 'left out of pocket' by car park firms",
    "body": "'Airport parking firms left us out of pocket'\n\n3 days ago By Clodagh Stenson , BBC South Investigations \u2022 Alex Bish , BBC South East Investigations Share\n\nKim Renyard Kim Renyard said she had not been fully reimbursed by the parking firm she used\n\nHolidaymakers say they have been left hundreds of pounds out of pocket after using two meet-and-greet car parking firms at Gatwick, the UK's second largest airport. One passenger said she had to get a taxi nearly 150 miles home to Norfolk after Drive Park and Fly told her they could not find her car key when she arrived at the West Sussex airport. Meanwhile, a Galaxy Parking Limited customer said he was charged six pounds each time his car entered and exited the Gatwick drop-off zone while he was on holiday. The BBC has contacted both firms - which are not connected to Gatwick Airport - multiple times for a comment, but they are yet to respond.\n\nWest Sussex Trading Standards said it had received 199 complaints about a number of parking operators since 2022/23. Kim Renyard said that when she tried to pick her car up, Drive Park and Fly said her keys \u201chad been lost or misplaced\u201d. She said she spent hundreds of pounds on a taxi to Norfolk, on the understanding her car would be dropped to her home once the company had cut new keys. Although the firm said they had cut a new key, she said her old set was returned with the car. \u201cI actually do not know what they did with my car while it was in their care,\u201d Ms Renyard said. She said she had not received any money and was more than \u00a3300 out of pocket, despite being told by Drive Park and Fly that she would be fully reimbursed.\n\nWhen Richard Bowyer returned from his holiday he said the parking firm initially could not find his car\n\nRichard Bowyer said he returned from a family holiday to be told that Drive Park and Fly had \u201cno recollection\u201d of having his car. He booked into a hotel, but with his car still missing the next morning, he had to take a taxi home to Hampshire, costing him about \u00a3400. A week later he said his car was found in the short stay car park, in the exact spot where he had handed it over to a company representative.\n\nAnother holidaymaker, Leon Palma, from Southampton, booked a meet-and-greet with Galaxy Parking Limited. But he said his holiday was interrupted when he received a series of automatically emailed receipts showing his car had entered and left the Gatwick Drop-Off zone six times during the same morning, when he was abroad, at a cost of six pounds each time.

She said she tried to get Drive Park and Fly to cover the \u00a3100 penalty but its staff \u201ceither put the phone down or ignored my emails\".\n\nOliver Bedford, head of car parking at Gatwick Airport, which is not connected to Drive Park and Fly or Galaxy Parking Limited, said passengers needed to do their research. He told the BBC: \"Although there are lots of legitimate companies off-airport and the official Gatwick parking, there are some firms who are not operating in a right and proper manner.\" He said people should be \"extra careful\" looking on comparison websites\" at providers and check their details. \"Do they have independent reviews?

    "body": "Japan declares victory in 'war' on floppy disks\n\nFloppy disks fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented\n\nIt's taken until 2024, but Japan has finally said goodbye to floppy disks.\n\nUp until last month, people were still asked to submit documents to the government using the outdated storage devices, with more than 1,000 regulations requiring their use.\n\nBut these rules have now finally been scrapped, said Digital Minister Taro Kono.\n\nIn 2021, Mr Kono had \"declared war\" on floppy disks. On Wednesday, almost three years later, he announced: \"We have won the war on floppy disks!\"\n\nMr Kono has made it his goal to eliminate old technology since he was appointed to the job. He had earlier also said he would \"get rid of the fax machine\".\n\nOnce seen as a tech powerhouse, Japan has in recent years lagged in the global wave of digital transformation because of a deep resistance to change.\n\nFor instance, workplaces have continued to favour fax machines over emails - earlier plans to remove these machines from government offices were scrapped because of pushback.\n\nThe announcement was widely-discussed on Japanese social media, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling floppy disks a \"symbol of an anachronistic administration\".\n\n\"The government still uses floppy disks? That's so outdated... I guess they're just full of old people,\" read another comment on X.\n\nOthers comments were more nostalgic. \u201cI wonder if floppy disks will start appearing on auction sites,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nCreated in the 1960s, the square-shaped devices fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented.\n\nA three-and-a-half inch floppy disk could accommodate up to just 1.44MB of data. More than 22,000 such disks would be needed to replicate a memory stick storing 32GB of information.\n\nSony, the last manufacturer of the disks, ended its production in 2011.\n\nAs part of its belated campaign to digitise its bureaucracy, Japan launched a Digital Agency in September 2021, which Mr Kono leads.\n\nBut Japan's efforts to digitise may be easier said than done.\n\nMany Japan businesses still require official documents to be endorsed using carved personal stamps called hanko, despite the government's efforts to phase them out.\n\nPeople are moving away from those stamps at a \"glacial pace\", said local newspaper The Japan Times.\n\nAnd it was not until 2019 that the country's last pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.",

(NFP) are expected to have declined to 190,000 in June. The unemployment rate is projected to remain at 4.0%.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the interest of financial market participants has increasingly shifted towards data on the US labor market, which has a great impact on the exchange rate of the dollar.\n\nIn the previous month, the dollar index rose to 105.85 points.\n\nOn the 5th of July, the US Labor Department is due to submit another report on the number of people employed in the non-agricultural sector. According to experts' expectations, the number of people employed will decrease to 190,000 in June, despite the fact that in May this figure was at the level of 272,000. Meanwhile, according to forecasts, the unemployment rate will remain stable at 4.0%. The US Federal Reserve is already receiving positive signals to reduce inflation, and unemployment data combined with NFP may strengthen sentiment in the direction of lowering the interest rate in the coming months. As a result, a change in the interest rate will have a strong impact on the entire financial market and investor sentiment. On Tuesday, the data showed an increase of 221,000 from the previous month to 8.140 million in May 2024, exceeding expectations. This data provides a positive signal for a potential reduction in unemployment. Average hourly earnings for all employees on US private nonfarm payrolls increased by 14 cents, or 0.4%, to $34.91 in May 2024.\n\nThe US unemployment rate reached a two-year high, hitting 4.0% in May 2024, the lowest level in more than two years. Analysts believe that the unemployment rate in June will remain at the May level of 4.0%.\n\n\"The increase in job openings could help address the rising unemployment issue and, consequently, inflation,\" said Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at Octa. \"The rise in unemployment amid increasing job openings indicates that the available jobs do not meet the population's expectations. Thus, the labor market is experiencing a cooling,\" he added.\n\nOver the past month, the increased by 1.17% to 105.85 points.

    "title": "Gold, Euro Rise on Soft US Economic Data",
    "body": "Gold Rose by Over 1% on Soft US Economic Data\n\nYesterday, broke above the resistance level of 2,340 and gained 1.14% as news and US reports bolstered investor hopes for an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed).\n\nUS economic data released on Wednesday, particularly the weak report on services and employment, showed a slowdown. Additionally, a report on for the last week showed an increase, supporting the view that the labor market is gradually cooling. The number of people applying for unemployment benefits rose further to a 2-year high by the end of June.\n\nThe ISM Services Purchase Manager's Index (PMI) data released yesterday was softer than expected, further fueling investors' hopes for rate cuts by the US central bank. The main focus is now on tomorrow's (NFP) report. The lower-than-expected NFP data could prompt the Fed to start lowering rates.\n\nAfter the release of the latest economic data, markets are now pricing in a 74% chance of the Fed cutting interest rates in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. \u2018The level of interest rates that's neutral in its impact on the economy likely hasn't risen much\u2019, said New York Fed President John Williams.\n\nAccording to Reuters, \"Fed officials at their last meeting acknowledged that the US economy appeared to be slowing but still counseled a wait-and-see approach before committing to rate cuts, according to minutes from the June 11\u201312 session\".\n\nToday, a quiet and calm market is expected ahead of tomorrow's increased volatility during the release of NFP data at 12:30 p.m. UTC. Today is Independence Day in the US, and the market will be closed. Thus, strong movements are not expected during the holiday. XAU/USD may slightly correct downwards after yesterday's growth towards around 2,350.\n\nEuro Jumps Higher on Rising Hopes for US Rate Cuts\n\nThe (EUR) gained 0.39% on Wednesday after US macroeconomic reports were weaker than expected, increasing the probability of the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivering two rate cuts this year.\n\nYesterday, US ADP Employment, Jobless Claims, and ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) reports revealed that the US economy was slowing. Specifically, the employment report showed that only 150,000 new jobs were created in June instead of the expected 160,000. The data suggests that the closely-watched Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) report due this Friday may also indicate emerging weakness in the labor market. Furthermore, ISM Services PMI dropped to a four-year low, hinting at the US economy slowing at the end of Q2.\n\n\"All of this creates mood music that is conducive to a modest easing in the degree of restraint in monetary policy later in the year, and we still expect two quarter-point cuts in September and December\", said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.\n\nIndeed, the latest interest rate swap market data implies roughly 48 basis points worth of cuts by the Fed in 2024. Meanwhile, according to official messages, the (ECB) monetary policy may not be as dovish as previously expected. On Wednesday, Slovenian central bank chief Bostjan Vasle urged the ECB to wait before lowering interest rates again, highlighting potential risks that could disrupt the eurozone's disinflationary trend.\n\nEUR/USD was falling slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. The US financial market will be closed today due to Independence Day, so the American trading session will likely be quiet. However, volatility may increase during the late European session, as traders will be repositioning before Friday. The technical bias in EUR/USD remains bullish as the pair moves above the important intraday level of 1.07700.\n\nThe US Dollar Slides on Soft Data, Boosting the Canadian Dollar\n\nThe (CAD) gained 0.28% on Wednesday after softer-than-expected US economic data increased the chances of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) this year.\n\nUSD/CAD hit a one-month low yesterday as weaker-than-expected US statistics surprised investors. All three reports\u2014ADP Employment, Jobless Claims, and ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)\u2014indicated that the economy was slowing at an accelerating rate, meaning that the Fed is now more likely to deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut this autumn. Indeed, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, investors have a 74% probability that the regulator will ease its monetary policy on September 18.\n\n\"The economic data surprises in the US are now undershooting expectations relative to other major economies, which has generally coincided with periods of dollar weakness\", wrote Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.\n\nAt the same time, the Canadian dollar received an additional boost from rising oil prices after a larger-than-expected decline in US crude stocks offset traders' concerns about rising global inventories. is one of Canada's key export items, so its price negatively correlates with USD/CAD. Still, the latest strength in the Canadian dollar was mostly caused by the greenback's weakness.\n\n\"It is more of a US story than a Canadian one\", said Tony Valente, senior FX dealer at AscendantFX.\n\nIn the long term, the market expects the Canadian dollar to strengthen. According to the latest Reuters poll, investors believe that CAD will likely rise over the coming year as the US election creates a lot of uncertainty.\n\nUSD/CAD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. The US financial market will be closed today due to Independence Day, so the American trading session will likely be quiet. However, volatility may increase during the late European session as traders will reposition ahead of Friday, featuring two important news releases. Apart from the headline US Nonfarm Payroll report, CAD traders should also monitor the Canadian Employment report. The data may significantly impact the Bank of Canada's monetary policy outlook.",

    "title": "Navigating a 'Bad News is Good News' Era Amid Fed's Rate Cut Outlook",
    "body": "We are forcefully entering a period of \u2018bad news is good news\u2019 as the Federal Reserve (Fed) moves toward its first rate cut. We don\u2019t know when the Fed will cut the rates \u2013 the Fed members themselves can\u2019t tell you that without more evidence of slowing economy and easing inflation as printed by yesterday\u2019s Fed minutes \u2013 but we know that the weaker the data the closer the first rate cut.\n\nYesterday soft data from the US fueled the Fed doves yesterday. The latest ADP report showed that the US economy added 150\u2019000 new private jobs in June, less than expected by analysts and slightly less than last month, initial jobless claims rose, the factory orders unexpectedly fell in May and the ISM services unexpectedly contracted in June, the employment component plunged while prices fell more than expected.\n\nAs such, investors saw in the data the evidence that the Fed is looking for to cut its rates. The tipped a toe below the 4.70% but bounced back to this level before the July 4th holiday, the dropped to 4.35% while the slipped below its June ascending channel base and tested the 50-DMA to the downside. The and advanced to a fresh record yesterday.\n\nThe US stock rally continues to be shouldered by the technology sector, the others remain timidly upbeat, a lower rate environment should broaden the rally to other sectors but other sectors could hardly print the same amplitude of gains than the tech. If the heftily-valued tech tumbles, the rest of the market will suffer.\n\nTime to Say Goodbye?\n\nBrits are heading to the polls today aiming to oust the Conservatives from power after 14 years. Labour is walking into this election with more than 20 points advance over the Tories \u2013 even the most Conservative parts of the country seem tired of a 14-year Tory rule. The two most likely scenarios are a good Labour majority with 150 seats \u2013 which is almost double Boris Johnson\u2019s 80-seat majority in 2019 - or a supermajority.\n\nBoth will give the Labour a very large margin to pass whatever reforms they want to pass in the coming years. Normally, investors prefer Conservatives as they have a better grip on spending and debt levels. But this time, even investors want to see Labour take over the reins. For Wall Street, a Labour win is positive for both the UK stocks and . Small and medium-sized British stocks will likely benefit more from a Labour win than the \u2013 which is mostly exposed to global market conditions.\n\nCable rallied to 1.2772 yesterday and is consolidating gains near 1.2740 at the time of writing. Combined with a soft , we could see the end of the Tory rule support the pound and back a move toward 1.30. Yet once the election vibes are over, eyes will turn to the Bank of England (BoE) rate cut bets, and the latter could eventually limit the pound\u2019s upside potential, but not the stocks\u2019.\n\nOn this side of the Channel, the broad-based dollar weakness sent the past the 1.0750 resistance yesterday, the pair tested shortly traded past the 1.08 level, but the French political risks prevail and visibility is low into the second election weekend in France where we just don\u2019t know whether Le Pen will or will not win a parliamentary majority. Investors wish for a hung government that would prevent Le Pen\u2019s National Rally from exploding debt, hence keep the borrowing costs and the yield spread with Germany at acceptable levels and avoid a Liz Truss like market reaction.\n\nYet a hung government is not an outright positive scenario for France as it will prevent politicians from making any important move for years without changing the fact that these latest elections have been a massive win for Marine Le Pen. But a hung government will certainly trigger a relief rally both in the French stocks and the euro next week, while a Le Pen victory \u2013 which is not the base case scenario as per the market pricing \u2013 would dampen the mood from Monday.\n\nFar from these jitters, the Japanese is up for the third consecutive session and is approaching an ATH level reached back in March. The doesn\u2019t dare to move above the 162 for now. A broad based dollar weakness helps keeping the pressure contained; Japanese policymakers would be as happy as any investor and mortgage holder to see the Fed move closer to the first rate cut.",

    "title": "Gartner Stock Near the End of the Elliott Wave Road",
    "body": "Gartner (NYSE: ) is a research and advisory firm, which, through its Research, Consulting and Conferences segments, helps business leaders make better-informed decisions. The company was founded in 1979 and went public in 1993. Currently, in the vicinity of $450, the share price is not far from its all-time high of $487 and gives Gartner a market cap of almost $35B.\n\nThe stock is one of the best performers in the market since the COVID-19 pandemic struck. It is up by over 480% from its March 2020, bottom at $77 a share. In investing, however, the price paid can make all the difference between a good and a bad investment. With the benefit of hindsight, Gartner was obviously a good pick below $80 four years ago. The question is, is it a good pick now near $450?\n\nThe weekly chart above reveals the stock\u2019s entire progress since the aftermath of the Dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. We see that the COVID-19 selloff fits in the position of wave \u2018c\u2019 of a simple a-b-c zigzag correction in wave (2). It followed a complete five-wave impulse in wave (1), marked 1-2-3-4-5. Wave (3) was a fast sharp surge, caused by a combination of FOMO, stimulus money, and rising company profits at Gartner.\n\nThe bulls temporarily stepped aside in wave (4) in the first half of 2022, before coming back with a vengeance in wave (5). If this count is correct, Gartner stock is on the verge of completing an impulse pattern, which has been in progress for over two decades. Wave 5 of (5) can still exceed the $500 mark, but instead of chasing it, investors should probably start taking profits.\n\nThere are two main reasons for our pessimism. The first one is that according to the Elliott Wave theory, a three-wave correction follows every impulse. Corrections usually erase the entire fifth wave. Here, the bears can drag the price back down to the support of wave (4) near $250 for a 50% decline. This may sound too bearish until you consider the second reason for our pessimism, namely that Gartner is trading at a forward P/E of 39.\n\nThat\u2019s too expensive for a company expected to grow earnings and revenue at a high-single to low-double-digit rate per year. Instead of buying near all-time highs, we\u2019d rather watch from afar until the valuation risk subsides.",

    "body": "These were the three top stocks on the S&P 500 in June.\n\nThe lagged a bit, gaining 1.1% in June, while small caps continued to struggle as the finished the month down 1.1%.\n\nThe also finished in the black for the second straight month, returning 3.5% in June. However, the was the big winner, recording one of its best months of the year with a 6.2% return in June.\n\nCorporate earnings remained strong, and while the Fed did not act on interest rates, inflation rates fell, indicating a continuing trend toward the Fed\u2019s target of 2% inflation.\n\nJune was an excellent month for the stock market as all of the major U.S. indexes posted positive returns.\n\nThree stock picks that could be worth a bet in July based on standout performance last month\n\n1. Adobe, up 24.9%\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ: ), which produces software for graphic design and photo editing, saw its share price spike in mid-June after the release of its fiscal second-quarter earnings.\n\nOn June 14, the share price jumped from $459 per share to $525 per share \u2014 a 14.4% leap \u2014 on a blowout earnings report that smashed estimates. Adobe stock ended the month up 24.9%.\n\nThe company generated record revenue of $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 10% year over year. Meanwhile, its net income skyrocketed 21.5% to $1.6 billion, or $3.50 per share.\n\n\u201cAdobe achieved record revenue of $5.31 billion driven by strong growth across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud,\u201d said Shantanu Narayen, chair and CEO of Adobe. \u201cOur highly differentiated approach to AI and innovative product delivery are attracting an expanding universe of customers and providing more value to existing users.\u201d\n\nAdobe also raised its revenue and earnings targets for its fiscal third quarter and the full fiscal year based on expectations for improved macroeconomic and foreign exchange environments.\n\nIt was a bounce-back month for Adobe. Even with the strong June performance, the stock is down 5.2% year to date.\n\n2. CrowdStrike, up 22%\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: ), which develops cybersecurity software, was the second-best performer on the S&P 500 in June, returning 22% for the month. Last month marked the continuation of a strong year for CrowdStrike stock, which has returned 50.5% YTD.\n\nJune was indeed an eventful month for the company as it was added to the S&P 500 on June 24. However, the major catalyst for CrowdStrike was its first-quarter fiscal-2025 earnings report, released on June 4.\n\nFollowing this blowout earnings report on June 4, CrowdStrike stock jumped from $305 per share to $343 per share the next day and kept rising from there.\n\nOne could see why, as CrowdStrike posted a 33% year-over-year increase in revenue to $921 million, while net income skyrocketed from $0.5 million in the same quarter a year ago to $43 million in the most recent quarter. Net earnings per share climbed to 18 cents per share, from 0 cents in the same quarter a year ago.\n\n\u201cIn addition to our strong top-line performance, financial highlights included record gross margin, significant year-over-year operating leverage, record free cash flow of $322 million or 35% of revenue and a rule of 68 on a free cash flow basis, showcasing our focus on profitably scaling the business to $10 billion ending ARR (annual recurring revenue) and beyond,\u201d said Burt Podbere, CrowdStrike\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nCrowdStrike also boosted its revenue and earnings outlook for the fiscal second quarter and full fiscal year. For the second quarter, it is calling for revenue of $958.3 million to $961.2 million, and for the full year, it is targeting $3.976 billion to $4.01 billion in revenue.\n\n3. Broadcom, up 20.8%\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: ) has been a juggernaut over the past few years, and it is not slowing down. The AI chipmaker posted a 20.8% return in June, and its stock price is up about 47% YTD.\n\nLike the other two stocks on this list, Broadcom stock was fueled by an excellent quarterly earnings report in June. The company grew revenue by 43% year over year in its fiscal second quarter to $12.5 billion.\n\nIts net income tumbled about 40% year over year, but that was impacted by expenses related to the acquisition of VMware (NYSE: ) last year. However, the adjusted net income, minus acquisition costs and other one-time expenses, soared 20% to $5.4 billion, or $10.96 per share.\n\nThose gains were driven by its AI chips, which generated record revenue in the quarter.\n\nThe other huge catalyst was the announcement of a 10-for-one stock split, which will take effect on July 15. When the split kicks in, investors will receive nine additional shares for every share they own.\n\nThe stock split could also fuel future growth, as Broadcom\u2019s share price will be lower by a factor of 10, making it more accessible to more investors. It is currently trading at $1,638 per share.\n\nBeware Valuations Amid the Potential\n\nAll three of these stocks are trading at high multiples, so be mindful of their valuations. However, all have excellent earnings potential and are worth considering as long-term options.\n\nMost immediately, look for Broadcom to potentially pop after the stock split, but again, keep an eye on the price-to-earnings ratio.",
    "summary": "These were the three top stocks on the S&P 500 in June.\nNet earnings per share climbed to 18 cents per share, from 0 cents in the same quarter a year ago.\nCrowdStrike also boosted its revenue and earnings outlook for the fiscal second quarter and full fiscal year.\nLike the other two stocks on this list, Broadcom stock was fueled by an excellent quarterly earnings report in June.\nBeware Valuations Amid the PotentialAll three of these stocks are trading at high multiples, so be mindful of their valuations.",

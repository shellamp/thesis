    "title": "Israelis protest for captives, against Netanyahu\u2019s Gaza war expansion",
    "body": "Thousands of Israelis have gathered outside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv, urging the government to prioritise the release of captives still held in Gaza instead of escalating military operations in the Palestinian territory.\n\nThe demonstration on Saturday was held as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government authorised the mobilisation of up to 60,000 reserve troops, signalling plans to intensify its assault on the besieged Palestinian enclave.\n\nOne protester held aloft a placard castigating Netanyahu that read, \u201cour tyrant is a liar, because of him the state is on fire\u201d.\n\nGovernment officials claim an expanded military offensive on Gaza will pressure Hamas into releasing the 59 remaining captives, but critics argue it further endangers their lives. Ending the fleeting ceasefire, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives earlier this year, has not led to any more releases.\n\nA video circulated by Hamas on Saturday purported to show one of the Israeli captives, whom local media identified as Maxim Herkin. In the four-minute video posted online, Herkin is seen being rescued by Hamas members after an Israeli attack struck a tunnel, burying and injuring the Israeli captive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamilies of the captives released a statement saying they spent the Sabbath gripped by \u201cexcruciating anxiety\u201d after news of the government\u2019s planned escalation and the effect it could have on those still held in Gaza.\n\nThe Bring Them Home Campaign, a group representing the relatives, condemned the move as reckless.\n\n\u201cIsrael is on its way to sinking into the Gaza mud in the name of the illusion that it is possible to achieve any victory without returning our brothers and sisters from captivity,\u201d the group said in a post on X. \u201cExpanding the fighting will endanger the kidnapped, the living and the dead alike.\u201d\n\nThey urged Netanyahu to abandon the offensive and instead reach an agreement that would secure the captives\u2019 return. \u201cStop this mistake,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u2018Protests not enough to influence Netanyahu\u2019\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Israeli journalist Gideon Levy said the protest movement remains consistent, but lacks the momentum to challenge Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s the same old protest, very courageous and devoted, but not big enough to influence Netanyahu,\u201d Levy said.\n\nHe noted that a large segment of Israeli society continues to support the war effort, even amid rising frustration from the captives\u2019 families, and that \u201cwhen [Israelis] are called to war, they will obey.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu, speaking Thursday at a public event in Jerusalem, seemed to suggest that defeating Hamas remains Israel\u2019s top priority instead of the release of captives. \u201cWe want to bring all our hostages home,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war has a supreme goal, and the supreme goal is victory over our enemies, and this we will achieve.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaptives\u2019 families have accused Netanyahu of undermining previous attempts to reach a truce and swap deal. Some believe his refusal to compromise reflects political motives, aimed at ensuring the survival of his far-right coalition government, rather than genuine concern for the captives.",

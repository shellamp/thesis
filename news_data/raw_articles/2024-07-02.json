    "body": "Taylor Swift performs on stage during The Eras Tour on June 28, 2024 in Dublin, Ireland. Charles Mcquillan/tas24 | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nTaylor Swift's European tour was top of mind for Nikita Rao when planning where to go for her family's annual summer vacation. Rao, her husband and two kids, who live in Bethesda, Maryland, headed overseas this past weekend: They have tickets to the pop star's concert in Amsterdam on Thursday. The family built a weeklong itinerary around The Eras Tour event, spending a few days in London before making their way to the Netherlands for the show. They would have likely visited the two cities at some point in the future, but the Swift concert accelerated their timeline, said Rao, 43, who also saw a performance in Cincinnati last year with her daughter. \"My view on it was, we should do this \u2014 London and Amsterdam \u2014 because she'll be there,\" Rao said. \"If I can get tickets, that'll just make the whole vacation amazing,\" she said of her thought process.\n\nWhy Taylor Swift is unique to 'passion tourism'\n\nTaylor Swift fans gather outside Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium for a concert in Madrid, Spain, on May 29, 2024. David Benito | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\n\nIt's not just the Rao family. Americans are flocking overseas to see Taylor Swift, perhaps the most prominent recent example of so-called \"passion tourism,\" according to travel experts. Passion tourism revolves (unsurprisingly) around people's passions. While place is also generally important, these trips are generally guided by personal interest, hobby or a cultural event, experts said. This isn't a new concept. In fact, there are many recent and upcoming examples: February's annual Carnival festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; April's total solar eclipse in North America; the 2024 Paris Olympics that start this month; and the ongoing UEFA European Football Championship (known as the Euro Cup) in Germany. \"Memorable events are driving travel trends, whether it is for concerts or sporting events,\" Mastercard wrote recently in its annual travel trends report.

But not for some destinations\n\nVacationers expect to carry summer travel debt\n\n5 ways to maximize your vacation days However, what distinguishes Taylor Swift concerts in the realm of passion tourism is the broad interest and enthusiasm among Americans who want to travel abroad, according to travel agents. \"I've never seen this excitement to travel to go see an artist,\" said Jessica Griscavage, a travel advisor and founder of Runway Travel. The most recent example that might come close is a Spice Girls concert in the 1990s, she said. Griscavage, who put together the Rao family's itinerary, also assembled a separate Swift-centered trip to Paris for a daughter, mother and grandmother. More than half of Americans, 53%, identify as fans of Taylor Swift, according to a poll by Morning Consult. About 16% consider themselves \"avid\" fans.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Beyonc\u00e9 is big, too, but we don't usually get requests like, 'I have Beyonc\u00e9 tickets for Europe and we want to build a trip around it,'\" said Sofia Markovich, a travel advisor and founder of Sofia's Travel. She assembled trips for two U.S. clients who had tickets for Taylor Swift shows in England and Switzerland, respectively. \"Just as Grateful Dead fans were known to follow the band from city to city to be part of a unique community, Swifties \u2014 often with friends and family in tow \u2014 have made traveling to her concerts part of the experience,\" Joshua Friedlander, vice president of research at the U.S. Travel Association, wrote recently about the so-called \"Swift Lift.\"\n\n'Inevitable' that Swifties will travel to new places\n\nAbout 15.9 million Americans traveled internationally in the first quarter of 2024, an all-time high, according to Mastercard's travel report. Consumers are also spending for travel at record levels globally, it said. Passion tourism generally provides an economic boost to host nations, experts said. For example, spending by tourists at restaurants, bars and grocery stores during the 2024 Carnival in Rio was 156% above normal, Mastercard found. During the solar eclipse, hotel sales within the U.S. path of totality rose 71%, it said.\n\nSpectators looking up at the solar eclipse at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Indiana, on April 8, 2024. Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nAbout 1.2 million fans will see a Taylor Swift concert this summer across four cities in the United Kingdom (Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London), according to a recent Barclays analysis. Each fan will spend an average 848 British pounds (about $1,073) on tickets, travel, accommodation, outfits and other expenses, amounting to a total 997 million British pounds (about $1.3 billion), Barclays estimated. Accommodation accounts for the largest outlay after tickets, followed by travel, according to the Barclays analysis. Searches for Airbnb stays in European cities during Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour dates are up about 70% relative to the same period in 2023, according to a recent analysis.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is big, too, but we don't usually get requests like, 'I have Beyonc\u00e9 tickets for Europe and we want to build a trip around it.' Sofia Markovich travel advisor\n\nRome and Paris are traditionally among Americans' top destinations to visit abroad. However, it's \"inevitable\" that Swift fans will end up in a city they may have previously overlooked, like Edinburgh, said Christopher Nulty, global head of corporate communications and public affairs at Airbnb. When tickets went on sale last year for Edinburgh concert dates, searches for lodging in the city by Americans jumped 500%, Nulty said. A concert \"combines the opportunity to travel somewhere incredible with the opportunity to see an artist they love,\" he said.",

    "title": "Peloton staved off the cash crunch that threatened its business. Where does it go now?",
    "body": "In this article PTON Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA Peloton Bike inside a showroom in New York, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2023. Peloton Interactive Inc. is scheduled to release earnings figures on November 2. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nPeloton no longer faces an imminent liquidity crunch after a massive debt refinancing, but the company still has a long road ahead to fix its business and get back to profitability. In late May, the connected fitness company secured a new $1 billion term loan, raised $350 million in convertible senior notes and received a new $100 million line of credit from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. All of those are due in 2029. The refinance reduced Peloton's debt from about $1.75 billion to around $1.55 billion and pushed off looming due dates on loans that it likely wouldn't have had the cash to pay back. Before the refinancing, Peloton would have needed to pay around $800 million toward its debt by November 2025. If it managed to pay that, about another $200 million still would have been due around three months later. The term loan would have been due in May 2027. For Peloton, which hasn't turned a net profit since December 2020 and has seen sales fall for nine straight quarters, the debt pile posed an existential threat and fueled investor concerns about a possible bankruptcy. Now that it has refinanced, Peloton has eased investor concerns about liquidity and has the breathing room it needs to try to turn around its business. The fact that it was able to secure these loans signals investors believe in its ability to rightsize its business and eventually pay them back, restructuring experts told CNBC. \"This refinancing is now putting us in a much better position for sustainable, profitable growth and just a much stronger financial footing than where we were before, and our investors saw that,\" finance chief Liz Coddington told CNBC in an interview. \"I think they believe in the story. They believe in what we're trying to do, as do we, and in the transformation of the business. And so it was just a great vote of confidence for Peloton's future.\"\n\nPeloton faces risks ahead\n\nWhile the refinance may have bought Peloton some time, it's far from a panacea. Under the terms, Peloton will now be spending about $133 million annually in interest, up from around $89 million previously. It will make Peloton's efforts to sustain positive free cash flow more difficult. Coddington acknowledged to CNBC that the higher interest expense is going to \"impact\" free cash flow, but said that's partly why the company started to cut costs in early May. The plan is expected to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million. Even with the higher interest payments, Coddington expects the company will be able to sustain positive free cash flow without having the business \"materially grow in the near term.\" \"The cost reduction plan made us much more comfortable with that,\" said Coddington. While Peloton insists that investors bought into its refinance because they believe in its strategy, some could be trying to put themselves in a better position if the company fails. Two of Peloton's largest debt holders, Soros Fund Management and Silver Point Capital, are known to sometimes invest in distressed companies. Since the Peloton loans they invested in are secured, they are near the top of the capital structure. If Peloton can't turn its business around and ends up in a position where it's considering or filing for bankruptcy, its creditors would be in a strong position to take control of the company. \"I would describe this refinancing slash recapitalization as sort of opportunistic,\" said Evan DuFaux, a special situations analyst at CreditSights and an expert in distressed debt. \"I think that's just sort of a smart, opportunistic and kind of tricky move.\" Silver Point declined to comment. Soros didn't return a request for comment.\n\nMore cost cuts to come?\n\nPeloton is in a far better cash position than it was a few months ago, but the company still needs to address the demand issues that have plagued it since the Covid-19 pandemic wound down and figure out what kind of business it will be in the future. \"It really is an exercise in kicking the can down the road because the refinancing itself buys time, but it doesn't actually fix any of the underlying problems at Peloton,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. \"Those are very different issues to the refinancing.\" Following former CEO Barry McCarthy's departure and with two board members, Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo, now in charge, Peloton needs to decide: is it a content company, like the Netflix for fitness, or is it a hardware company that needs to develop new strategies to sell its pricey equipment? So far, straddling both has proven to be unsuccessful. \"They're going to have to make some decisions about which parts of the model are survivable, which parts are not, or things that they can do to advance forward without losing the great brand value that they still currently have, especially with the loyal following that they have,\" said Scott Stuart, the CEO of the Turnaround Management Association and an expert in corporate restructurings. \"Money doesn't fix everything, and the issue becomes the more money you take and the more you refinance ... the more problematic it becomes,\" he added. Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst for BMO Capital Markets, said Peloton can start addressing its issues by forgetting about trying to grow the business for now and instead focus on \"bear hugging\" its millions of brand loyalists. He pointed out that the company makes about $1.6 billion in recurring, high-margin subscription revenue and sees more than $1.1 billion in gross profit from that side of the business. \"The problem is, they lose money. How do you lose money if you're generating a billion one of recurring gross profit dollars?\" said Siegel. \"Well, you take all of that gross profit and you spend it to try and chase new growth.\" He said Peloton could generate around $500 million in EBITDA if it cuts research and development, marketing and other corporate expenses. For example, Peloton's marketing budget is around 25% of annual sales, and if the company reduces it to even 10%, it would still be in the \"upper echelon of most brands,\" said Siegel. \"Their debt is scary on a company that's burning cash, their debt's not scary at all on a company that can make half a billion dollars of EBITDA,\" he said. \"They have a business that's generating a tremendous amount of cash. They need to stop spending it.\" In May, Peloton announced it would cut 15% of its corporate workforce, but it may be more reluctant to back off its growth strategy. Peloton founder John Foley set a goal of growing to 100 million members, and McCarthy adopted the target when he took over. As of the end of March, Peloton had about 6.6 million members \u2014 woefully behind that long-term target. Since the company announced its cost cutting plan, McCarthy's departure and another disastrous earnings report in early May, Peloton has been largely mum on its strategy. It said that it's searching for a new permanent CEO, and the person it hires will offer clues about the company's direction. If it hires another \"hyper growth tech CEO\" like McCarthy \u2013 who had done stints at Netflix and Spotify \u2013 then Peloton will likely face the same issues, Siegel said. But if it taps someone different, it could signal a strategy shift.\n\nContent magic",

    "body": "Vehicles are offered for sale at a GM dealership in Lincolnwood, Illinois, on June 20, 2024.\n\nDETROIT \u2014 General Motors reported its best quarterly sales in more than three years, including notable increases in full-size pickup trucks and all-electric vehicles.\n\nThe Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported sales of 696,086 for the second quarter, up 0.6% from a year earlier and its highest quarterly units sold since the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nIts EV deliveries increased 40% compared to a year earlier to 21,930 units. Still, EVs made up only 3.2% of its total second-quarter sales.\n\nSales of GM's full-size pickup trucks were roughly 229,000 during the second quarter, up about 6% from a year earlier and the best quarterly sales since 2021.\n\nGM's total sales through the first half of the year were down 0.4%, however, compared to a year earlier to roughly 1.3 million vehicles.\n\nGM's second-quarter sales are expected to slightly outpace the overall industry. Auto industry forecasters such as Cox Automotive and Edmunds expect second-quarter sales industrywide, including July 1, to be roughly level from a year earlier amid slowing retail demand.\n\nAn unknown outlier in the second quarter is how much of an effect cyberattacks on dealer software provider CDK Global will have on sales. The June 19 ransomware attack forced CDK, a market leader, to shut down its dealer management system, affecting close to half of all dealerships in North America.\n\n\"The CDK cyberattacks have thrown a monkey wrench into sales during the second half of June, affecting what is arguably one of the most lucrative and busiest times of the month and quarter for dealerships,\" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.\n\nGM, in a statement, said its \"dealers who use the CDK platform are working to meet strong customer demand under difficult circumstances. Some deliveries may be delayed until Q3.\"\n\nDealers, including the industry's largest publicly traded ones, were forced to delay sales or figure out workarounds to sell vehicles since the attacks occurred.\n\nAll six of the major publicly traded franchised dealership groups have disclosed their exposure to the CDK issue. Five of the six \u2014 Asbury Automotive Group , AutoNation Inc. , Group 1 Automotive Inc. , Lithia Motors Inc. and Sonic Automotive Inc. \u2014 use CDK as their primary dealership management system provider, according to Automotive News.\n\n\"The good news is \u2014 unlike other black swan events that the industry has contended with in the past \u2014 sales shouldn't be lost or severely deferred, but rather pushed into the third quarter,\" Caldwell said.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, Toyota reported its second-quarter sales. The company's U.S. sales totaled 621,549 vehicles during the period, up 9.2% compared to a year earlier.\n\nThe Hyundai brand sold 214,719 vehicles during the second quarter, up 2.2% compared to a year earlier.\n\nKia, which reports sales on a monthly basis, reported a 6.5% decrease in its June sales. Its sales for the first half of the year were down about 2% to 386,460 vehicles sold.",

Terms of the deal were undisclosed.\n\nWith this acquisition, bars, restaurants, casinos and other businesses will be able to stream \"Sunday Ticket\" games. Until recently, they could only do so through a subscription to satellite TV provider DirecTV.\n\nDirecTV will remain as a distributor to bars and restaurants, however. EverPass signed a nonexclusive deal with DirecTV last year to continue to distribute \"Sunday Ticket\" games, giving it the ability to reach deals with other distribution platforms.\n\n\"More content is moving to streaming. Regardless of the streaming economics, it's become pretty clear that live sports is an important piece of that,\" said EverPass CEO Alex Kaplan. \"We're going to think about how to deliver a product and service to our customers that's becoming increasingly more challenging for them to sort of aggregate in a meaningful way. We're still in the early days ... but this is a big step for us.\"\n\nThe new distribution option will be available this coming NFL season.\n\nThe acquisition for EverPass comes as more live sports games are being offered exclusively on streaming services \u2014 a new frontier for business establishments that have long subscribed to traditional pay TV packages to offer live sports.\n\n\"Sunday Ticket\" is an integral sports package for bars and restaurants since it provides all out-of-market NFL games.\n\nIn late 2022, Google' s YouTube TV acquired the residential rights to \"Sunday Ticket\" for roughly $2 billion a year, a deal which runs over seven years. DirecTV had been the owner and exclusive residential and commercial distributor of the games since the package's inception in 1994.\n\nThis followed a deal for Amazon' s Prime Video to become the exclusive home of \"Thursday Night Football\" \u2014 part of the 11-year NFL media rights agreement worth more than $100 billion.\n\nSince then, the media rights owners of NFL games have begun to offer games simultaneously on their streaming services \u2014 and in some cases exclusively. Earlier this year Comcast 's NBCUniversal aired an NFL wild-card game on Peacock, the first time a postseason game was exclusively offered via streaming. Netflix also recently won the rights to air two NFL games on Christmas this year, and at least one on the holiday in the following two years.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell announces that interest rates will remain unchanged during a news conference at the Federal Reserves\u2019 William McChesney Martin building on June 12, 2024 in Washington, DC.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed satisfaction Tuesday with the progress on inflation over the past year but said he wants to see more before being confident enough to start cutting interest rates.\n\n\"We've made quite a bit of progress and in bringing inflation back down to our target,\" Powell said at a central banking forum in Sintra, Portugal.\n\n\"The last [inflation] reading and the one before it to a lesser extent, suggest that we are getting back on the disinflationary path. We want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2% before we start the process of reducing or loosening policy,\" he added.\n\nPowell spoke at a forum that also included European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Brazil central bank Governor Roberto Campos Neto. The forum was presented by the ECB and the discussion was moderated by CNBC's Sara Eisen.\n\nThe comments come with markets closely watching moves from the Fed and its global counterparts as inflation shows signs of easing and some central banks, including the ECB, have slowly started rolling back interest rates.\n\nThe Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Fed focuses on as its main inflation gauge, rose at a 2.6% 12-month pace in May. That level has come down steadily after being around 4% a year ago, though policymakers do not expect it to reach the Fed's 2% goal until 2026.\n\nWhile Powell said he sees progress on inflation, he's wary of moving too soon and threatening the downward path of price increases, which hit their highest pace since the early 1980s two years ago.\n\n\"We're well aware that if we go too soon, that we can undo the good work we've done,\" he said. \"If we do it too late, we could unnecessarily undermine the recovery and the expansion.\"\n\nRisks of moving too late as opposed to too soon have come into better balance this year as inflation has ebbed and the economy and labor market have stayed strong, Powell added. By contrast, the Fed spent much of the past year worried that cutting rates too soon and allowing inflation to resume its upward trek posed the greater risk.\n\nEarlier this year, markets had expected at least six Fed rate cuts of a quarter percentage point each. Market pricing has since adjusted to anticipate two reductions, one in September and another before the end of the year. However, members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee at their June meeting penciled in just one.\n\nAsked if he thought the Fed might cut in September, Powell responded, \"I'm not going to be landing on any specific dates here today.\"\n\nHe also was asked about whether he was concerned about the political climate and specifically should Donald Trump, a fierce Powell critic, win the November presidential election.\n\n\"I am not focused on that at all, and that's not just a talking point. I really think that we just keep doing our jobs,\" he said.",

In June, year-on-year energy inflation in the euro zone was 0.2%, a sharp switch from earlier in the year when the sector had a strong disinflationary pull. On Tuesday, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos told CNBC's Annette Weisbach that, while the central bank was confident that inflation would converge to its 2% target, the coming months would be a \"bumpy road\" and there is no \"predetermined path\" for monetary policy.

Bailey told The Courier Herald he had prepared a message to share at church that night and had it tucked inside his Bible before he set the book on his car for a moment.\n\n\u201cWe were getting ready to leave, and I sat [the Bible] on top of my car, and my granddaughter called and wanted me to come back inside the house for something,\u201d he told the outlet, explaining he forgot to grab the Bible and put it in the car before driving off. \u201cWe got to church, got out, and I thought I had forgotten my Bible.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when he realized the book was gone. He and his wife, Dot, prayed for it to be found, but months went by, according to The Courier Herald.\n\nBailey said he was \u201csick\u201d over the loss and felt he would simply never find it again. Still, being selfless at his core, Bailey told his wife he hoped \u201cwhoever found it got some good out of it.\u201d\n\nLittle did he know, someone did find the Bible. A man named Barron Howard, Jr. discovered it in the family\u2019s driveway. And when his grandma, Barbara James, heard about the surprising find, she set out on a mission to locate its rightful owner.\n\n\u201cIf I lost my Bible, I would really want it back,\u201d she told The Courier Herald. \u201cI would hope that whoever found it would go the extra steps to find it and get it back to me. I just couldn\u2019t rest.\u201d\n\nJames truly didn\u2019t stop trying, but she wasn\u2019t getting anywhere; she couldn\u2019t find any information in the Bible that would lead her back to the mystery owner. James reportedly did find a number inside the Bible and phoned it twice a day \u2014 but no one answered.\n\nThat misfortune changed, though, when she noticed a zipper she had previously overlooked. Inside, she discovered a pamphlet for Faith Baptist Church. It was just the lead James had been desperately looking for. She called the pastor and found out about Bailey\u2019s search for the Bible.\n\nThen, the preacher told Bailey about James, and the two connected \u2014 a blessed miracle for Bailey, who was convinced his beloved Bible had been long obliterated by a lawn mower.\n\nJames recently brought the Bible to Dot, who works at a nursing home, and the families connected. Bailey is ecstatic, realizing not everyone would have gone to such lengths to get it back to its owner.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sentimental stuff to me,\u201d Bailey said of sermon notes and personal commentary inside the Bible. \u201cI thank the Lord that I got it back.\u201d\n\nJames is simply overjoyed she was able to help. Bailey gave her a financial gift for returning his beloved Bible.\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

    "title": "Want to Connect with Gen Z? Invite Them Over for Dinner",
    "body": "ANALYSIS\n\nGen Z is maturing within an unprecedented culture of media saturation. The entire world, via the internet, is available to them at all times on their smartphones.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not always a happy place, nor is it one that\u2019s particularly easy to make sense of. As such, their relationship with media, with themselves \u2014 and with other people \u2014 is complicated in a number of ways we are still realizing.\n\nBut what if I told you they, just like us, crave and seek out the advice and consolation of trusted people in their real lives when they\u2019re struggling? What if I told you that most prefer to connect face-to-face rather than through technology?\n\nYou might be surprised. After all, the mainstream depiction of Gen Z is often a teen endlessly scrolling on their phone, beset by depression and anxiety, falling slowly away from family and faith.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what they\u2019re like at all. According to recent data in The RELATE Project, the majority of Gen Z wants to talk to trusted parents, mentors, and friends when they\u2019re struggling. Gen Z is seeking connection and intentional relationships. They are surprisingly grounded, community-oriented, prayerful, and intentional as a demographic.\n\nThankfully, breaking down the walls between Gen Z and older generations seems to be something anyone and everyone can do, if they choose. The adolescents interviewed for The RELATE Project were quick to express a desire for authentic, no-fuss dinner-table conversations, recognizing that such an environment lends itself towards engaging in meaningful discussions about life and what\u2019s on their minds. Sharing life and authentic conversations\u2014where both sides listen\u2014also promotes relationship.\n\nThat means that any one of us can make a difference in the lives of Gen Z. Any one of us can open our homes to them, welcome them into our families, and invite them to share their lives, struggles, and joys at our side.\n\nSo invite them for dinner. Ask them to stay awhile. If we want them to flourish, we must unabashedly fling open the doors of our homes to the younger people in our midst, allowing them access to our dinner table, yes, but most importantly to our experiences, our lived wisdom, our relationship with God, our kindness, our time, and even our challenges.\n\nWhy? Because face-to-face interactions in an intimate, authentic setting can be the catalyst for a meaningful, long-term relationship of trust and respect. These relationships provide emerging adults with the tools \u2013 and the relationships \u2013 they need to thrive now and later on.\n\nOf course, feeding them isn\u2019t the only thing you need to do when they sit down at your table. The most important thing is to listen to them without judgment. They may not always want or even need our advice, but they do need us to actively listen \u2013 so be engaged and attentive. A simple \u201cTell me more,\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d or \u201cWhat else?\u201d shows that you are listening and creating space for those at your table to share with ease. Just as Kelly Corrigan advocates in her show Tell Me More, asking thoughtful questions leads to better connections and conversations.\n\nMy family made a practice of intentionally sharing our daily highs and lows at dinner. We found that, in doing so, we laid the groundwork for more complicated, personal, probing conversations \u2014 conversations that involved community concerns, faith, friendships, sorrows, and the future. These conversations were a tremendous gift to all of us, and I cherish the intimacy and authenticity we shared over those meals.\n\nThe kitchen table became a place to share the funny stories of our days, the struggles, and how we saw God showing up in our lives. I think our adult kids still feel safe to come to us now thanks in part to relationships built around the dinner table when they were young.\n\nBut this sense of safety, belonging, and trust shouldn\u2019t be limited to our own children or immediate family. It can be extended to every person whose lives we touch, though it may look very different from home to home or from person to person.\n\nYou can, for instance, become the available parent or grandparent, the house where all the kids hang out after school, and create a space of hospitality \u2013 where all are welcome. Because it\u2019s in those moments of carpooling, dishing out snacks, and opening your home after baseball or dance practice that opportunities arise to express that they are welcome, valued, and cared about \u2014 and that they belong.\n\nCarving out time to build authentic relationships with Gen Z matters. They\u2019ve told us they need us. They\u2019ve told us how they need us. So let\u2019s listen.\n\nDr. Kimberly Nollan is the director of research and evaluation at Young Life.",

The figure for London was \u00a32,652 a month \u2013 almost three times the \u00a3894 asked for in north-east England.\n\nRightmove said the average advertised rent outside London in May was an inflation-busting 7% higher than a year earlier.\n\nIn the capital, meanwhile, an improvement in the balance between supply and demand meant annual rent growth has slowed from its peak of 18% in 2022 to 4% in May this year, still higher than the 2% official consumer prices index (CPI) inflation figure for May.\n\nRightmove called on the next government \u201cto accelerate housebuilding and incentivise landlords to invest in more homes for tenants\u201d to help tackle the supply and demand imbalances and stabilise rental growth.\n\nIt said its analysis showed about 120,000 more rental properties were needed to return rent growth to \u201cmore normal levels\u201d of about 2% a year, based on current demand.\n\nRent rises have been blamed largely on demand greatly outstripping supply, exacerbated by landlords with buy-to-let mortgages trying to pass on sizeable increases in their costs caused by higher interest rates.\n\nIn many areas there were \u201cnowhere near enough homes to satisfy the number of tenants looking to move\u201d, Rightmove said.\n\nScotland was the hardest hit by supply and demand imbalances, the property company said. By contrast, the situation had improved in London owing to fewer tenants looking to move and an increase in available properties to rent.\n\nTim Bannister, Rightmove\u2019s property expert, said: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget there was a time before the pandemic where rental price growth was more stable. [Annual] price growth at 7% suggests we are still out of balance.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe next government should be prioritising an improvement to the planning process, an acceleration of housebuilding, and encouraging more supply into the rental market.\u201d\n\nSeparate figures from Propertymark, a professional body for estate and letting agents, showed there were about nine new applicants registered for each available UK property in May.\n\nIt said that though most of its members reported that rents were continuing to increase or were static, there was some good news for prospective tenants with 18% of firms reporting rents falling against 12% in April.",

    "title": "Labour is putting its plans for Britain in the hands of private finance. It could end badly | Daniela Gabor",
    "body": "The Labour party has a plan for returning to power: it will get BlackRock to rebuild Britain. Its reasoning is straightforward. A cash-strapped government that wants to avoid tax increases or austerity has no choice but to partner with big finance, attracting private investment to rebuild the infrastructure that is crumbling after years of Tory underinvestment. Labour has already done the arithmetic: to mobilise \u00a33 of private capital from institutional investors, you need to offer them \u00a31 in public subsidies. But every time you hear Labour announce such an infrastructure partnership, think of the hidden politics. BlackRock will privatise Britain \u2013 our housing, education, health, nature and green energy \u2013 with our taxpayer money as sweetener.\n\nBlackRock has long peddled the idea of public-private partnerships for infrastructure, climate and development. Yet its political momentum has recently accelerated. When its chair, Larry Fink, the world\u2019s most powerful financier, sat with world leaders at the G7 summit last month, he promised the following: rich countries need growth, infrastructure investment can deliver that growth, but public debt is too high for the state alone to invest the estimated $75tn (\u00a359tn) necessary by 2040. Trillions, however, are available to asset managers who look after our pensions and insurance contributions (BlackRock, the largest of these firms, manages about $10tn, as a shrinking welfare state pushes us \u2013 future pensioners \u2013 into its arms).\n\nIf governments work with big finance, Fink explained, they can unlock these trillions. But to do so, they will need to mint public infrastructure into investable assets that can generate steady returns for investors. Why does BlackRock need the state? Why can\u2019t it deploy trillions without the government\u2019s helping hand? The British public remembers all too well PFIs, the private finance initiatives through which the state ended up paying extortionate amounts to private contractors that designed, built, financed or operated public services such as prisons, schools and hospitals before handing them back to the state, often in poor condition.\n\nBut for big finance, there is more now at stake. In this golden age of infrastructure, financiers plan to own our infrastructure outright and transform it into a source of steady revenue. Since buying Global Infrastructure Partners in January 2024, BlackRock holds about $150bn in infrastructure assets, including US renewable energy companies, wastewater services in France and airports in England and Australia. It plans to expand aggressively, just like other private infrastructure funds. Direct ownership is the main game, but not the only one. Big finance can also invest in infrastructure indirectly, by lending to private infrastructure companies. The key is returns. For this, BlackRock wants the state to \u201cderisk\u201d investments. This financial jargon was included in the 2024 Labour manifesto, and it in essence involves the state stepping in to improve the returns on infrastructure assets.\n\nThe choice here is not merely between public and private financing of public goods, but whether British citizens should tolerate the government handing out public subsidies for privatised infrastructure. Housing is only one example of the areas where these investors can already be glimpsed. Institutional landlords \u2013 the most prominent being Blackstone, the private equity fund \u2013 can acquire residential housing by participating in the privatisation of public housing. After the global financial crisis, the firm also bought up nonperforming mortgages, and since then it has gone on a global shopping spree, snapping up homes across the US and Europe. In the past year, Blackstone bought new rental homes in Britain worth about \u00a31.4bn from the housebuilding company Vistry.\n\nLook behind Blackstone\u2019s returns \u2013 which come from rents and rising house prices \u2013 and you will find the state\u2019s footprint. The government has helped to guarantee and derisk these returns through regulations that favour asset owners over renters, through economic policies that support house price inflation and through the provision of income support \u2013 such as housing benefit \u2013 that allows renters to continue paying their institutional landlords. Although we\u2019re told that partnering with these investors is a means of solving the housing crisis, it often delivers the opposite: higher rents, the displacement of lower-income tenants who are often from minority groups, and less affordable housing. This explains the backlash against institutional landlords, from Copenhagen to Berlin, Dublin and Madrid. Yet such public pressure will only be effective once the state returns to building public housing.\n\nLabour\u2019s strategy raises a bigger set of questions about the type of state we want. Starmer\u2019s vision for government-by-BlackRock reduces the question of state capacity to \u201chow do I get BlackRock to invest in infrastructure assets?\u201d This model involves the state in effect subsidising the privatisation of everyday life. This doesn\u2019t only make it harder to bring public goods back into public ownership; it also allows big finance to tighten the grip on the social contract with citizens, and to become the ultimate arbiter of climate, energy and welfare politics, which will have profound distributional, structural and political consequences.\n\nAlready, BlackRock is betting on becoming a key provider of green energy infrastructure \u2013 though its actual commitment to tackling the climate crisis only extends so far. The firm has lobbied heavily against European proposals to regulate its lending to fossil fuel interests with penalties, and has instead called for voluntary climate commitments. It is aiming to rapidly grow its green energy profits by tapping the government subsidies that will probably be provided through Starmer\u2019s GB Energy, and through the US Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut the profits BlackRock will hope to generate through investing in green energy are likely to come at a huge cost. In Britain, we know that the public ownership of green energy is more effective at lowering consumer bills, accelerating the green transition and creating good jobs. The risk is not only that our climate future will be vastly more expensive if actors such as BlackRock are driving it, but that this future will also produce a more unequal society, where citizens equate green measures with unaffordable public services. This may well provide the kindling for authoritarian, far-right fossil-fuel politics that reject the green transition and frame it as an assault on people\u2019s living standards.\n\nInstead, we should plan creatively for a future where extreme climate events necessitate permanent state intervention, from price controls to buffer stocks and public ownership. What\u2019s needed is a big green state. For this, we first need to repair a serious failure of macroeconomic policy imagination that regards the public purse as too small to fund transformative public infrastructure. To do so will require a radical transformation of the state. The state that Rachel Reeves, the likely future chancellor, promises us must break down the neoliberal walls between monetary, fiscal and industrial policy, and scrap low-tax regimes for multinational corporations and individuals with high net worths. It must shrink the power of big finance. This would be a gigantic undertaking, but it is the only realistic one we have.\n\nDaniela Gabor is professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol",

    "body": "Inflation across the eurozone slowed to 2.5% in June despite lingering pressure on households from price increases in the service sector, leaving the European Central Bank on track to keep interest rates on hold this month.\n\nAnnual inflation in consumer prices across the 20-country bloc eased from 2.6% in May, according to a flash estimate from the EU statistical agency Eurostat, matching financial market expectations.\n\nHowever, core inflation \u2013 which strips out food, energy, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 remained unchanged at 2.9%, marginally higher than predicted by economists in a reflection of stubborn inflationary pressures.\n\nAnalysts said the figures were unlikely to encourage the ECB to cut interest rates again at its next policy meeting on 18 July, after it became the first big global central bank to reduce official borrowing costs, in June.\n\n\u201cNothing in these figures would make the ECB cut again in July, and we think it\u2019ll be eagerly awaiting data over the summer before seriously debating a next rate cut in September,\u201d said Bert Colijn, the senior eurozone economist at the Dutch bank ING.\n\n\u201cThe summer is set to be relatively boring [for the ECB]. It can afford not to carry out another rate cut based on the too-high core inflation reading and labour market strength, and will likely just await incoming data on wages, inflation and growth. It can also see how market turmoil around the French elections plays out.\u201d\n\nIn its flash estimate for June, Eurostat figures showed services had the highest annual inflation rate at 4.1%, a stable rate compared with May. Annual price growth for food, alcohol and tobacco slowed from 2.6% in May to 2.5%.\n\nRiccardo Marcelli Fabiani, a senior economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said: \u201cInflation resumed its descent after it had been temporarily interrupted in May, and it will continue to fall as inflationary pressures wane thanks to easing wage growth, lower energy prices and normalised price expectations. But core inflation remaining stable reminds us that the disinflationary process will be bumpy.\u201d\n\nThe ECB cut its main deposit rate last month to 3.75% from a record high of 4%, putting it ahead of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which have yet to cut interest rates. It was the first time that the main eurozone interest rate had been reduced in almost five years.\n\nHowever, the central bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, said on Monday that benign economic developments suggest that further interest rate cuts are not urgent, with a robust labour market and resilient wage growth.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "body": "Economic growth will bring prosperity to all. This is the mantra that guides the decision-making of the vast majority of politicians, economists and even human rights bodies.\n\nYet the reality \u2013 as detailed in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council this month \u2013 shows that while poverty eradication has historically been promised through the \u201ctrickling down\u201d or \u201credistribution\u201d of wealth, economic growth largely \u201cgushes up\u201d to a privileged few.\n\nIn the past four years alone the world\u2019s five richest men have more than doubled their fortunes, while nearly 5 billion people have been made poorer. If current trends continue, 575 million people will still be trapped in extreme poverty in 2030 \u2013 the deadline set by the world\u2019s governments to eradicate it. Currently, more than 4 billion people have no access whatsoever to social protection.\n\nHundreds of millions of people are struggling to survive in a world that has never been wealthier; many are driven to exhaustion in poorly paid, often dangerous jobs to satisfy the needs of the elite and to boost corporate profits. In low-income countries, where significant investment is still required, growth can still serve a useful role. In practice, however, it is often extractive, relying on the exploitation of a cheap workforce and the plundering of natural resources.\n\nConcrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product\n\nThe endless quest for growth at all costs, and the escalating use of the natural resources it demands, is pushing our planet way beyond its limits. Six of the nine \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d \u2013 Earth\u2019s life-support systems \u2013 have already been crossed. For too long, the health of our planet has been sacrificed for inequitable material gain.\n\nOur economies are failing us. We urgently need to look beyond profit, beyond the short term and beyond the interests of the few.\n\nA \u201chuman rights economy\u201d can deliver for people and the planet because it shifts our focus from growth to humanity \u2013 grounding the purpose of the economy in fundamental, universal human values. It offers human rights as a guardrail to keep the economy on track \u2013 meeting the challenges of the climate crisis, addressing inequalities and eradicating poverty.\n\nThis proposition is not some fairytale. Concrete steps can be taken now, starting with choosing measures of progress other than gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 which tells us nothing about the ecological or social fallout of economic activity.\n\nAnd we need to start valuing what really counts. GDP has no way of accounting for the estimated 16.4bn hours spent every day worldwide on unpaid work, largely carried out by women, that underpins the global economy: caring for children, people with disabilities and older citizens.\n\nUnpaid domestic and care work should be remunerated through paid parental and carers\u2019 leave, included in pension calculations, and supported through access to safe water, sanitation, affordable childcare facilities and other essential services.\n\nFinancing these services while reducing our dependence on GDP growth is achievable through progressive tax policies such as inheritance and wealth taxes, preventing illegal financial flows and tax evasion, and tackling corruption. More effective international cooperation on tax, debt and social protection is also needed.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Global Dispatch Free newsletter Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The barriers are real: most people have been led to believe that economic growth equals human progress. Yet a growing movement is rallying against our growth-driven economic model: climate activists, workers and trade unions, scientists and academics, young people, environmental and human rights defenders, Indigenous peoples, progressive economists, and activists fighting inequality, gender disparities and colonialism are speaking out.\n\nAs world leaders prepare to gather for the Summit of the Future in September \u2013 a UN initiative that aims to forge a global consensus around what our future should look like \u2013 this groundswell of support for an alternative vision of progress must be embraced. Without a roadmap for a global economy that protects human rights, including the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the final document leaders agree in New York will continue to lead us down the path to extinction.",

Voting happens in two rounds, and candidates who reached certain thresholds will move on to the next round on Sunday.\n\nA two-year streak of high inflation has left low- and middle-income French families grappling to pay for basics like energy, gas and food, while wages, in some cases, have failed to keep pace. Polls show that worries over \u201cpurchasing power\u201d were a top concern of voters, alongside immigration and security.

    "title": "How Microsoft and Nvidia bet correctly to leapfrog Apple",
    "body": "How Microsoft and Nvidia bet correctly to leapfrog Apple\n\n4 days ago By Zoe Kleinman , Technology editor Share\n\nGetty Images Under Jensen Huang's leadership Nvidia has seen its share price soar\n\nLife comes at you fast. Last month, AI chip giant Nvidia briefly became the world\u2019s richest company, overtaking Microsoft, which had in turn risen above Apple. When this news was mentioned on stage at a tech industry event I attended in Copenhagen, there was spontaneous applause from the audience. As I write, Nvidia is now back in second place, after a fall in its share price took its combined value down to $3tn (\u00a32.4tn) compared with $3.4tn for Microsoft. Two things have propelled these two US tech titans to such a dizzying pinnacle: AI and foresight. Microsoft started investing in OpenAI, the creator of popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019. Meanwhile, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang pushed his company towards AI chip development many years before generative AI exploded onto the scene. Both firms took a long-term bet on the current AI boom \u2013 and so far, it\u2019s paid off, leaving former top-dog Apple trailing in their wake. But how long will it last?\n\nThis year\u2019s London Tech Week, an annual event for the UK tech scene, may as well have been called London AI Week. The letters AI were emblazoned on every stand, and uttered in every speech. I bumped into Anne Boden, the founder of Starling Bank, a significant fintech disruptor. She was buzzing with excitement. \u201cWe thought we knew who the winners and losers were [in tech],\u201d she told me. \u201cBut with AI, we are throwing the dice again\u201d. She believes she\u2019s watching the AI revolution re-landscape the tech sector, and she wants to dive back in. That same week I also popped along to Founders Forum, an annual gathering of around 250 high-level entrepreneurs and investors. Some serious money, in other words. It\u2019s a confidential event, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get into too much trouble for saying that much of the chat there was also centred around AI. A few days after that, a headline in the Financial Times caught my eye. \u201cMost stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year,\u201d it read, claiming that more than half of the stocks in Citigroup\u2019s \u201cAI winners basket\u201d had fallen in value in 2024. Life comes at you fast indeed.\n\nGetty Images Anne Boden says that AI has completely shaken up the tech sector\n\n\u201cGiven how high valuations have leapt for tech companies, missteps ahead could cause big wobbles in share prices,\u201d warns Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cJust like the dot.com bubble, over-enthusiasm risks spilling over into disappointment.\u201d In 2023 you\u2019d have been forgiven for thinking that anything with the acronym AI in it was guaranteed to open up a lucrative seam of funding, with investment dollars flooding into all things AI. My friend Saurabh Dayal, who is based in Scotland, identifies AI projects for his pharmaceutical firm to potentially collaborate on. He said he soon grew tired of misleading pitches. \u201cI spend a lot of time saying \u2018\u2026 but that\u2019s not AI\u2019,\u201d he tells me. It seems both investors and clients are finally growing wiser to the term AI, and, as a result, more picky.\n\nSpeaking to the FT, Citi\u2019s Stuart Kaiser said that while AI remained a big theme in the world of stocks and shares, \u201cjust saying AI 15 times isn\u2019t going to cut it anymore\u201d. In addition, there is increased awareness of current generative AI products not exactly living up to their own hype. Inaccuracies, misinformation, displays of bias, copyright infringements and some content that\u2019s just plain weird. And early AI-enabled physical devices like the Rabbit R1 and Humane Pin have received bad reviews. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the market around generative AI mature a little right now \u2013 early experiments set a lot of grand expectations, but when the rubber hit the road there were too many unexpected outcomes,\u201d says Chris Weston, chief digital and information officer of the tech service firm Jumar. \u201cBusinesses have a lot of value tied up in goodwill \u2013 the trust and comfort that their clients have in their services. Introducing ungovernable chatbots is a step too far for many right now.\u201d Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore agrees that the pressure is on for AI firms to deliver on their promises. \u201cThe bubble will burst the moment one of the giants fails to show any meaningful growth from AI,\u201d he says. But he does not believe that is going to happen any time soon. \u201cEveryone is still jostling for position, and all companies are pinning their strategies on AI,\u201d he adds. \u201cAll the players are ramping up their activities, increasing spend and claiming early successes.\u201d\n\nGetty Images ChatGPT is the AI app that has really caught the public's attention",

    "title": "S&P 500: Are Stock Prices Reaching Medium-Term Highs?",
    "body": "Monday\u2019s trading session didn\u2019t change much, with the gaining 0.27% and extending a short-term consolidation, remaining relatively close to a new record high reached on Friday at 5,523.64. It still looks like a flat correction within an uptrend. Are there any signs that may point to a more meaningful downward correction?\n\nAs I mentioned in my stock price forecast for July yesterday,\n\n\u201cWhile more advances remain likely, the likelihood of a deeper downward correction also rises. Overall, there have been no confirmed negative signals so far, but the May gain of 4.8% and June gain of 3.5% suggest a more cautionary approach for July. The market will be waiting for the quarterly earnings season in the second half of the month. Plus, there will be a series of economic data, including the CPI release on July 11, the Advance GDP number on July 25, and the FOMC Rate Decision on July 31.\u201d\n\nThis morning, the S&P 500 is likely to open 0.5% lower, as indicated by futures contracts. So, it may see more short-term uncertainty, and possibly more profit-taking action. For now, it still looks like a consolidation within an uptrend though.\n\nLast week, the investor sentiment remained basically unchanged, as indicated by the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey on Wednesday, which showed that 44.5% of individual investors are bullish, while 28.3% of them are bearish (up from last week's reading of 22.5%). The AAII sentiment is a contrary indicator in the sense that highly bullish readings may suggest excessive complacency and a lack of fear in the market. Conversely, bearish readings are favorable for market upturns.\n\nThe S&P 500 index continues sideways after breaking its upward trend line last week, as we can see on the daily chart.\n\nNasdaq 100 Remains Below 20,000\n\nOn Friday, the technology-focused reached a new record high of 20,017.71, before retracing the advance and closing slightly lower. It basically extended a consolidation following the first half of June rally. This morning, the Nasdaq 100 is expected to open 0.6% lower, retracing yesterday\u2019s advance of 0.66%.\n\nVIX Is Still Close to 12\n\nThe , also known as the fear gauge, is derived from option prices. In late May, it set a new medium-term low of 11.52 before rebounding up to around 15 on correction worries. Since the previous Thursday, it has been closing above the 13 level, showing increasing fear in the market, but on Friday, it dipped to a local low of 11.87. Yesterday, the VIX closed slightly above 12, which means that there is basically no fear in the market.\n\nHistorically, a dropping VIX indicates less fear in the market, and rising VIX accompanies stock market downturns. However, the lower the VIX, the higher the probability of the market\u2019s downward reversal.\n\nFutures Contract Is Closer to 5,500\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the hourly chart of the contract. This morning, it\u2019s trading closer to the 5,500 level after retracing its yesterday\u2019s rebound. The market may be forming a topping pattern; however, the support level is still around 5,500.\n\nConclusion\n\nStocks are likely to open lower this morning, retracing their yesterday\u2019s advances as there is growing uncertainty about a possible correction amid the coming economic data and earnings releases. The risk of a downward correction is increasing; however, it still looks like a flat correction of the uptrend.\n\nQuoting my yesterday\u2019s stock price forecast for July,\n\n\u201cInvestors continue pricing in the Fed\u2019s monetary policy easing that is supposed to happen this year. Hence, a medium-term downward reversal still seems a less likely scenario. However, the recent record-breaking rally may be a cause for some short-term concern as a downward correction may be coming.\u201d\n\nFor now, my short-term outlook remains neutral.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:",

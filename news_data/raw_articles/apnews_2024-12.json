    "body": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts just got their space mission extended again. That means they won\u2019t be back on Earth until spring, 10 months after rocketing into orbit on Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule.\n\nNASA announced the latest delay in Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams\u2019 homecoming on Tuesday.\n\nThe two test pilots planned on being away just a week or so when they blasted off June 5 on Boeing\u2019s first astronaut flight to the International Space Station. Their mission grew from eight days to eight months after NASA decided to send the company\u2019s problem-plagued Starliner capsule back empty in September.\n\nNow the pair won\u2019t return until the end of March or even April because of a delay in launching their replacements, according to NASA.\n\nA fresh crew needs to launch before Wilmore and Williams can return and the next mission has been bumped more than a month, according to the space agency.\n\nNASA\u2019s next crew of four was supposed to launch in February, followed by Wilmore and Williams\u2019 return home by the end of that month alongside two other astronauts. But SpaceX needs more time to prepare the brand new capsule for liftoff. That launch is now scheduled for no earlier than late March.\n\nNASA said it considered using a different SpaceX capsule to fly up the replacement crew in order to keep the flights on schedule. But it decided the best option was to wait for the new capsule to transport the next crew.\n\nNASA prefers to have overlapping crews at the space station for a smoother transition, according to officials.\n\nMost space station missions last six months, with a few reaching a full year.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

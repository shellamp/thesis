    "body": "CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez picked the perfect opportunity to join another exclusive baseball club.\n\nCleveland\u2019s six-time All-Star became the first primary third baseman in history to reach 250 career homers and 250 stolen bases during the 10th inning of the Guardians 4-3 victory against the Minnesota Twins.\n\n\u201cAt that moment, the last thing you\u2019re thinking is any milestones or personal records,\u201d Ramirez said through an interpreter. \u201cTo me it was where we had the chance to get running, obviously get in a position where I can score with a base hit given the situation of the game.\u201d\n\nRam\u00edrez, who has 260 homers, got his 250th steal with one out in the 10th inning after he got aboard with an RBI base hit. The 32-year old native of the Dominican Republic is the 24th player to accomplish the feat, and the only active one in the majors.\n\nHe is also the first Cleveland player reach 250-250 and just the second switch-hitter, joining Carlos Beltr\u00e1n (435 homers, 312 stolen bases).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to hard work for a really long time and being really, really good for a long time,\u201d manager Stephen Vogt said. \u201cHe came through big with the hit and then he gets the stolen base in the milestone and scores a winning run as well. He should have. He just continues to get accolade after accolade and I really enjoy watching it.\u201d\n\nAfter Kyle Manzardo got aboard on an intentional walk, Ram\u00edrez acknowledged the small crowd still at Progressive Field after two rain delays totaling 2 hours, 23 minutes, and pointed at the scoreboard when it showed he had reached the milestone.\n\n\u201cIt was a good moment, but especially seeing all the guys on the dugout trying to cheer me up and chanting my name. So that\u2019s kind of like something that make me smile,\u201d he said.\n\nRam\u00edrez then scored the game-winning run on Angel Martinez\u2019s single. He also made sure he got the base to add to his collection, saying he would add it to the three other bases he has marking other accomplishments.\n\nRam\u00edrez dazzles his teammates on an almost daily basis, so it\u2019s not a surprise to them that he\u2019s added his name to another elite list.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that leads by example,\u201d catcher Bo Naylor said. \u201cHe goes out there, plays his hardest, and when you see one of the leaders on your team doing that, there\u2019s no excuse for you to not be able to do that. He takes on that role himself and just does such a good job of keeping all of us accountable without making his voice heard in a way.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the guys that makes this whole team go and every accomplishment that he\u2019s had come along the way, it\u2019s been super awesome to be able to witness it one and be able to celebrate it with him afterward.\u201d\n\nAlong with the other milestones, Ram\u00edrez joins Robin Yount, Craig Biggio and Derek Jeter as the only players to accomplish the 250-250 feat with only one team.\n\n\u201cMilestones are important, but for me the really important part is to keep playing and trying to win,\u201d said Ramirez, who made his big-league debut in 2013 \u201cWinning is the most important thing for me and I feel still young. I feel like I can still continue doing this and hopefully we can continue adding up.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFreelancer Tom Withers contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

    "title": "Blues hoping to defend home ice once again as Jets look to fight their way into NHL\u2019s second round",
    "body": "The first five games of the Winnipeg-St. Louis series have all had the same result. The home team won.\n\nThe Blues need that trend to continue Friday \u2014 or else.\n\nGame 6 of the Jets-Blues matchup awaits in St. Louis, with Winnipeg \u2014 the NHL\u2019s best team in the regular season \u2014 holding a 3-2 series lead. The Blues rolled to wins on their home ice in Games 3 and 4, taking those games by scores of 7-2 and 5-1 to extend a run of invincibility there that has lasted for more than two months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough building to play in,\u201d Jets forward Vladislav Namestnikov said. \u201cBut I know we can get the win there.\u201d\n\nIf they do, they will be doing so without star Mark Scheifele, the team\u2019s second-leading scorer and leader in game-winning goals this season. Scheifele was hurt in Game 5 and wasn\u2019t flying with Winnipeg to St. Louis on Thursday for Game 6.\n\nThe teams had different opinions about when Scheifele got hurt, but the bottom line is the Jets will be missing a big part of their team for a potential closeout game.\n\n\u201cCertainly, not having him is going to be huge,\u201d Jets coach Scott Arniel said Thursday. \u201cBut at the end of the day, last night, our three centermen had to step up and play big minutes and did a great job. ... So proud of the group, how everybody stepped up. It\u2019s kind of what our team has done all year. Guys go down, other guys step in.\u201d\n\nWinnipeg was the most recent visiting team to win in St. Louis \u2014 but that was more than two months ago.\n\nThe Blues have put together the longest home winning streak in the NHL this season, a 14-game run that started on Feb. 23 and hasn\u2019t stopped. St. Louis has outscored opponents 69-25 in that span at home, winning by an average of a whopping 3.14 goals per game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played some good hockey at home for a couple months now,\u201d St. Louis\u2019 Brayden Schenn said. \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable there.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a bit of an understatement. The Blues have simply looked like a different team in their own building; St. Louis has had stretches of three goals in five minutes, three goals in eight minutes and three goals in 15 minutes so far in this series on its own ice.\n\nThey looked nothing like that club in Game 5, a 5-3 Winnipeg win that probably wasn\u2019t as close as that score would make it seem. Blues coach Jim Montgomery didn\u2019t waste any time thinking about that game once the final horn sounded.\n\n\u201cWe can analyze every part of it. They were better,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re on to the next one.\u201d\n\nIt took St. Louis a long \u2014 long \u2014 time to get home on Thursday, after their travel plans were seriously delayed.\n\nThe Blues had plane issues trying to leave Winnipeg and, after a replacement jet was sent to Manitoba, they finally took off about eight hours behind schedule.\n\nThe Jets landed in St. Louis around 3 p.m. Central time on Thursday, actually a tiny bit ahead of schedule, while the Blues didn\u2019t get there until about 9 p.m.\n\nWinnipeg Jets at St. Louis Blues\n\nWhen/Where to Watch: Game 6, Friday. 8 p.m. (TNT/truTV/Max)\n\nSeries: Jets lead 3-2\n\nWinnipeg hasn\u2019t closed out a series with a road win since 2018, and getting it done Friday will be difficult.\n\nForget St. Louis\u2019 14-game home winning streak, which is impressive enough. The Blues simply don\u2019t give up scoring chances in their building; they have allowed two goals or less in 11 of those 14 wins, and that level of stinginess puts enormous pressure on the other team\u2019s netminder.\n\nThat said, Winnipeg goalie and MVP hopeful Connor Hellebuyck has reveled in big moments like this all season.\n\nThe newly announced Hart Trophy finalist \u2014 alongside Edmonton forward Leon Draisaitl and Tampa Bay forward Nikita Kucherov \u2014 led the NHL with 47 wins, a 2.00 GAA, and a .925 save percentage this season, had eight shutouts, steered Winnipeg to its first Presidents\u2019 Trophy, won the William M. Jennings Trophy (fewest goals allowed) for the second straight year and seems like a lock for the Vezina Trophy (top goalie) for the second straight year and third time in six seasons.\n\nIf Hellebuyck does win the Hart as MVP, he\u2019d be the fourth goalie in the league\u2019s expansion era to do it alongside Dominik Hasek, Jos\u00e9 Th\u00e9odore and Carey Price. He was pulled twice in St. Louis and has a gaudy 3.96 goals-against average and .822 save percentage in this series \u2014 including all three wins.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our best player,\u201d Namestnikov said.\n\n___\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",

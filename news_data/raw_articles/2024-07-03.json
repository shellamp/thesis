    "body": "Former President Donald Trump, left, and President Joe Biden face off in the first debate of the 2024 presidential campaign, in Atlanta, June 27, 2024. Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nThe recent U.S. presidential debate saw both candidates trade barbs related to the economy. High pandemic-era inflation was among the grievances. \"He caused the inflation,\" Trump said of Biden during the June 27 debate. \"I gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation,\" he added. Biden countered by saying inflation was low during Trump's term because the economy \"was flat on its back.\" \"He decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy,\" Biden said.\n\nwatch now\n\nBut the cause of inflation isn't so black-and-white, economists say. In fact, Biden and Trump are not responsible for much of the inflation consumers have experienced in recent years, they said.\n\n'Neither Trump nor Biden is to blame'\n\nGlobal events beyond Trump's or Biden's control wreaked havoc on supply-and-demand dynamics in the U.S. economy, fueling higher prices, economists said. There were other factors, too. The Federal Reserve, which acts independently from the Oval Office, was slow to act to contain hot inflation, for example. Some Biden and Trump policies such as pandemic relief packages also likely played a role, as might have so-called \"greedflation.\" \"I don't think it's a simple yes/no kind of answer,\" said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning think tank. \"In general, presidents get more credit and blame for the economy than they deserve,\" he said. More from Personal Finance:\n\nTrump may roll back student loan forgiveness programs if elected\n\nWhat a Supreme Court ruling could mean for Biden's 'billionaire tax'\n\nBiden, Trump accuse each other of ruining Social Security, Medicare That Biden is seen as stoking high inflation is due somewhat to optics: He took office in early 2021, around the time inflation spiked notably, economists said. Likewise, the Covid-19 pandemic plunged the U.S. into a severe recession during Trump's tenure, pulling the consumer price index to near zero in spring 2020 as unemployment ballooned and consumers cut spending. \"In my view, neither Trump nor Biden is to blame for the high inflation,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The blame goes to the pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe big reasons inflation spiked\n\nInflation has many tentacles. At a high level, hot inflation is largely an issue of mismatched supply and demand. The pandemic upended the typical dynamics. For one, it disrupted global supply chains. There were labor shortages: Illness sidelined workers. Child-care centers closed, making it hard for parents to work. Others were worried about getting sick on the job. A decline in immigration also reduced worker supply, economists said. China shut down factories and cargo ships couldn't be unloaded at ports, for example, reducing the supply of goods. Meanwhile, consumers changed their buying patterns. They bought more physical stuff such as living room furniture and desks for their home offices as they spent more time indoors \u2014 a departure from pre-pandemic norms, when Americans tended to spend more money on services such as dining out, travel, and going to movies and concerts.\n\nCargo containers sit stacked on ships at the Port of Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s busiest container port, in San Pedro, California, on Oct. 15, 2021. Mario Tama | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nHigh demand, which boomed when the U.S. economy reopened broadly, coupled with goods shortages fueled higher prices. There were other related factors, too. For example, automakers didn't have enough semiconductor chips necessary to build cars, while rental car companies sold off their fleets because they didn't think the recession would be short-lived, making it pricier to rent when the economy rebounded quickly, Wessel said. As Covid cases were hitting record highs heading into 2022, further disrupting supply chains, Russia's war in Ukraine \"supercharged\" inflation by stoking higher prices for commodities such as oil and food around the world, Zandi said. As a result, global inflation hit a level \"higher than seen in several decades,\" the International Monetary Fund wrote in October 2022. \"We only have to look at the still high inflation rates in most other advanced economies to see that most of this inflation period was really about global trends ... rather than about the specific policy actions of any given government (though they did of course play some role),\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist for Capital Economics, wrote in an e-mail.\n\nBig spending bills' impact 'only clear in hindsight'\n\nHowever, Biden and Trump aren't entirely without fault: They greenlit additional government spending in the pandemic era that contributed to inflation, for example, economists said. For example, the American Rescue Plan \u2014 the $1.9 trillion stimulus package Biden signed in March 2021\u2014 offered $1,400 stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits and a larger child tax credit to households, in addition to other relief. The policy led to \"some good things,\" such as a strong job market and low unemployment, said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. But its magnitude was greater than the U.S. economy needed at the time, serving to raise prices by putting more money in consumers' pockets, which fueled demand, he said. \"I do think President Biden bears some responsibility for the inflation that we've been living through for the past few years,\" Strain said.\n\nHe estimated the American Rescue Plan added about 2 percentage points to underlying inflation. The consumer price index peaked around 9% in June 2022, the highest since 1981. It's since declined to 3.3% as of May 2024. The Federal Reserve \u2014 the U.S. central bank \u2014 aims for a long-term inflation rate near 2%. \"I think if it weren't for the American Rescue Plan, the U.S. still would have had inflation,\" Strain added. \"So I think it's important not to overstate the situation.\" However, Zandi viewed the ARP's inflationary impact as \"good\" and \"desirable,\" bringing the economy back to the Fed's long-term target inflation rate after a prolonged period of below-average inflation. Trump had also authorized two stimulus packages, in March and December 2020, worth about $3 trillion. These so-called \"fiscal policy\" responses were insurance against a lousy economic recovery, perhaps overshooting after the U.S.' lackluster response to the Great Recession that mired the nation in high unemployment for years, Wessel said. That the U.S. issued perhaps too much stimulus was the presidents' fault but \"only clear in hindsight,\" he said. Biden and Trump also enacted other policies that may contribute to higher prices, economists said. For example, Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and several goods from China, which Biden largely kept intact. Biden also set new import taxes on Chinese goods such as electric vehicles and solar panels.\n\nThe Fed and 'greedflation'",

    "body": "Pictured here is a stone with tungsten ore inside a mine in Germany run by Saxony Minerals and Exploration. Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China dominates the supply chain for many of the world's critical minerals, but so far it's held off on sweeping restrictions on at least one: tungsten. The metal is nearly as hard as diamond and has a high energy density. That's made tungsten an important material in weapons, autos, electric car batteries, semiconductors and industrial cutting machines. Chipmakers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Nvidia both use the metal. \"I don't expect any saber-rattling over tungsten,\" said Lewis Black, CEO of Canada-based Almonty Industries, which is spending at least $75 million to reopen a tungsten mine in South Korea later this year. \"If you get too belligerent about diversification, [it becomes a situation that's] biting the hand that feeds you,\" he said, adding that \"tungsten has always been a diplomatic metal.\" While the Biden administration raised tariffs on imports of tungsten in May, China this past weekend did not include the metal in new regulations for boosting its oversight of domestic rare earths production.\n\nBut China might not be too concerned, because the Chinese government ignored the new tariffs... They completely ignored it because the Chinese don't want tensions to rise. Lewis Black CEO of Almonty\n\n\"The tariffs were more of a warning shot, as Biden only put tariffs on three of the 25 strategic metals China exports,\" Black said. \"But China might not be too concerned, because the Chinese government ignored the new tariffs, unlike in the past when they restricted some exports of rare earths. They completely ignored it because the Chinese don't want tensions to rise.\" Asked last month if China would retaliate to the latest U.S. tariffs on tungsten, China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong didn't announce countermeasures. Instead, he called on the U.S. to remove the additional duties. Commodity price reporting and analytics company Fastmarkets pointed out earlier this year that China has reduced national production quotas for its tungsten mines due to environmental restrictions.\n\nDiversifying away from China\n\nStill, Black expects his company to benefit from growing efforts to diversify away from China. Almonty claims the forthcoming mine in South Korea has the potential to produce 50% of the world's ex-China tungsten supply. Demand for non-Chinese tungsten is already on the rise. \"We see in the U.S., in Europe, they ask their suppliers for a China-free supply chain,\" said Michael Dornhofer, founder of metals consulting firm Independent Supply Business Partner.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe U.S. REEShore Act \u2014 or Restoring Essential Energy and Security Holdings Onshore for Rare Earths Act of 2022 \u2014 prohibits the use of Chinese tungsten in military equipment starting in 2026, while the European Commission last year extended tariffs on imported Chinese tungsten carbide for another five years, Almonty Industries pointed out in a report. The House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party last month announced a new working group on the U.S. critical minerals policy.\n\nSoaring tungsten prices\n\nExpectations for higher demand and limited supplies of tungsten have pushed prices to multi-year highs, although they have tapered off in the last several weeks. Dornhofer said in an interview in late May that he was also seeing Chinese buyers increasing their tungsten purchases. \"Since the beginning of this year, they are not only asking for Western concentrate, but they are buying significant volumes, paying even more than Western companies are willing to pay,\" he said. \"Definitely [going to be] a game changer.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nBack in January, U.S.-based research firm Macro Ops said: \"We're approaching an inflection point in tungsten supply. The US will quickly run out of stockpiled tungsten and flip from net seller to buyer over the next 12-18 months.\" The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on this story. Brandon Beylo, head of investment research at Macro Ops, told CNBC in an email there are only six companies in the U.S. with capacity to produce tungsten. He added that the U.S. hasn't produced tungsten domestically since 2015, meaning future U.S. supply must come from overseas. He said the firm doesn't own tungsten-related stocks, but that he's personally looking for ways to access the physical commodity. There are no futures for trading tungsten.\n\nOther tungsten players going to South Korea\n\nChina dominates over 80% of the tungsten supply chain, although local production costs are rising as the mines age, according to Argus, noting Chinese imports of the metal from North Korea, central Africa and Myanmar. \"This presents an opportunity for projects outside China,\" Mark Seddon, principal, consulting and analytics at Argus, said in a June 28 webinar. Other non-Chinese companies in the tungsten supply chain are going to South Korea. In February, IMC Endmill, an affiliate of Warren Buffett-owned IMC Group, signed an agreement with the Daegu city government for a 130 billion Korean won ($93.6 million) investment in a tungsten powder manufacturing facility, according to a local news report. IMC Group did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nwatch now",

    "title": "How thousands of Americans got caught in fintech\u2019s false promise and lost access to bank accounts",
    "body": "watch now\n\nWhen Natasha Craft first got a Yotta banking account in 2021, she loved using it so much she told her friends to sign up. The app made saving money fun and easy, and Craft, a now 25-year-old FedEx driver from Mishawaka, Indiana, was busy getting her financial life in order and planning a wedding. Craft had her wages deposited directly into a Yotta account and used the startup's debit card to pay for all her expenses. The app \u2014 which gamifies personal finance with weekly sweepstakes and other flashy features \u2014 even occasionally covered some of her transactions. \"There were times I would go buy something and get that purchase for free,\" Craft told CNBC. Today, her entire life savings \u2014 $7,006 \u2014 is locked up in a complicated dispute playing out in bankruptcy court, online forums like Reddit and regulatory channels. And Yotta, an array of other startups and their banks have been caught in a moment of reckoning for the fintech industry. For customers, fintech promised the best of both worlds: The innovation, ease of use and fun of the newest apps combined with the safety of government-backed accounts held at real banks. The startups prominently displayed protections afforded by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., lending credibility to their novel offerings. After all, since its 1934 inception, no depositor \"has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits,\" according to the agency's website. But the widening fallout over the collapse of a fintech middleman called Synapse has revealed that promise of safety as a mirage. Starting May 11, more than 100,000 Americans with $265 million in deposits were locked out of their accounts. Roughly 85,000 of those customers were at Yotta alone, according to the startup's co-founder, Adam Moelis. CNBC reached out to fintech customers whose lives have been upended by the Synapse debacle. They come from all walks and stages of life, from Craft, the Indiana FedEx driver; to the owner of a chain of preschools in Oakland, California; a talent analyst for Disney living in New York City; and a computer engineer in Santa Barbara, California. A high school teacher in Maryland. A parent in Bristol, Connecticut, who opened an account for his daughter. A social worker in Seattle saving up for dental work after Adderall abuse ruined her teeth.\n\n'A reckoning underway'\n\nSince Yotta, like most popular fintech apps, wasn't itself a bank, it relied on partner institutions including Tennessee-based Evolve Bank & Trust to offer checking accounts and debit cards. In between Yotta and Evolve was a crucial middleman, Synapse, keeping track of balances and monitoring fraud. Founded in 2014 by a first-time entrepreneur named Sankaet Pathak, Synapse was a player in the \"banking-as-a-service\" segment alongside companies like Unit and Synctera. Synapse helped customer-facing startups like Yotta quickly access the rails of the regulated banking industry. It had contracts with 100 fintech companies and 10 million end users, according to an April court filing. Until recently, the BaaS model was a growth engine that seemed to benefit everybody. Instead of spending years and millions of dollars trying to acquire or become banks, startups got quick access to essential services they needed to offer. The small banks that catered to them got a source of deposits in a time dominated by giants like JPMorgan Chase . But in May, Synapse, in the throes of bankruptcy, turned off a critical system that Yotta's bank used to process transactions. In doing so, it threw thousands of Americans into financial limbo, and a growing segment of the fintech industry into turmoil. \"There is a reckoning underway that involves questions about the banking-as-a-service model,\" said Michele Alt, a former lawyer for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a current partner at consulting firm Klaros Group. She believes the Synapse failure will prove to be an \"aberration,\" she added. The most popular finance apps in the country, including Block's Cash App, PayPal and Chime, partner with banks instead of owning them. They account for 60% of all new fintech account openings, according to data provider Curinos. Block and PayPal are publicly traded; Chime is expected to launch an IPO next year. Block, PayPal and Chime didn't provide comment for this article.\n\n'Deal directly with a bank'\n\nWhile industry experts say those firms have far more robust ledgering and daily reconciliation abilities than Synapse, they may still be riskier than direct bank relationships, especially for those relying on them as a primary account. \"If it's your spending money, you need to be dealing directly with a bank,\" Scott Sanborn, CEO of LendingClub , told CNBC. \"Otherwise, how do you, as a consumer, know if the conditions are met to get FDIC coverage?\" Sanborn knows both sides of the fintech divide: LendingClub started as a fintech lender that partnered with banks until it bought Boston-based Radius in early 2020 for $185 million, eventually becoming a fully regulated bank.\n\nScott Sanborn, LendingClub CEO Getty Images\n\nSanborn said acquiring Radius Bank opened his eyes to the risks of the \"banking-as-a-service\" space. Regulators focus not on Synapse and other middlemen, but on the banks they partner with, expecting them to monitor risks and prevent fraud and money laundering, he said. But many of the tiny banks running BaaS businesses like Radius simply don't have the personnel or resources to do the job properly, Sanborn said. He shuttered most of the lender's fintech business as soon as he could, he says. \"We are one of those people who said, 'Something bad is going to happen,'\" Sanborn said. A spokeswoman for the Financial Technology Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing large players including Block, PayPal and Chime, said in a statement that it is \"inaccurate to claim that banks are the only trusted actors in financial services.\" \"Consumers and small businesses trust fintech companies to better meet their needs and provide more accessible, affordable, and secure services than incumbent providers,\" the spokeswoman said. \"Established fintech companies are well-regulated and work with partner banks to build strong compliance programs that protect consumer funds,\" she said. Furthermore, regulators ought to take a \"risk-based approach\" to supervising fintech-bank partnerships, she added. The implications of the Synapse disaster may be far-reaching. Regulators have already been moving to punish the banks that provide services to fintechs, and that will undoubtedly continue. Evolve itself was reprimanded by the Federal Reserve last month for failing to properly manage its fintech partnerships.\n\nIn a post-Synapse update, the FDIC made it clear that the failure of nonbanks won't trigger FDIC insurance, and that even when fintechs partner with banks, customers may not have their deposits covered. The FDIC's exact language about whether fintech customers are eligible for coverage: \"The short answer is: it depends.\"\n\nFDIC safety net\n\nWhile their circumstances all differed vastly, each of the customers CNBC spoke to for this story had one thing in common: They thought the FDIC backing of Evolve meant that their funds were safe. \"For us, it just felt like they were a bank,\" the Oakland preschool owner said of her fintech provider, a tuition processor called Curacubby. \"You'd tell them what to bill, they bill it. They'd communicate with parents, and we get the money.\" The 62-year-old business owner, who asked CNBC to withhold her name because she didn't want to alarm employees and parents of her schools, said she's taken out loans and tapped credit lines after $236,287 in tuition was frozen in May. Now, the prospect of selling her business and retiring in a few years seems much further out. \"I'm assuming I probably won't see that money,\" she said, \"And if I do, how long is it going to take?\" When Rick Davies, a 46-year-old lead engineer for a men's clothing company that owns online brands including Taylor Stitch, signed up for an account with crypto app Juno, he says he \"distinctly remembers\" being comforted by seeing the FDIC logo of Evolve. \"It was front and center on their website,\" Davies said. \"They made it clear that it was Evolve doing the banking, which I knew as a fintech provider. The whole package seemed legit to me.\" He's now had roughly $10,000 frozen for weeks, and says he's become enraged that the FDIC hasn't helped customers yet. For Davies, the situation is even more baffling after regulators swiftly took action to seize Silicon Valley Bank last year, protecting uninsured depositors including tech investors and wealthy families in the process. His employer banked with SVB, which collapsed after clients withdrew deposits en masse, so he saw how fast action by regulators can head off distress. \"The dichotomy between the FDIC stepping in extremely quickly for San Francisco-based tech companies and their impotence in the face of this similar, more consumer-oriented situation is infuriating,\" Davies said. The key difference with SVB is that none of the banks linked with Synapse have failed, and because of that, the regulator hasn't moved to help impacted users. Consumers can be forgiven for not understanding the nuance of FDIC protection, said Alt, the former OCC lawyer. \"What consumers understood was, 'This is as safe as money in the bank,'\" Alt said. \"But the FDIC insurance isn't a pot of money to generally make people whole, it is there to make depositors of a failed bank whole.\"\n\nWaiting for their money\n\nFor the customers involved in the Synapse mess, the worst-case scenario is playing out. While some customers have had funds released in recent weeks, most are still waiting. Those later in line may never see a full payout: There is a shortfall of up to $96 million in funds that are owed to customers, according to the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. That's because of Synapse's shoddy ledgers and its system of pooling users' money across a network of banks in ways that make it difficult to reconstruct who is owed what, according to court filings. The situation is so tangled that Jelena McWilliams, a former FDIC chairman now acting as trustee over the Synapse bankruptcy, has said that finding all the customer money may be impossible. Despite weeks of work, there appears to be little progress toward fixing the hardest part of the Synapse mess: Users whose funds were pooled in \"for benefit of,\" or FBO, accounts. The technique has been used by brokerages for decades to give wealth management customers FDIC coverage on their cash, but its use in fintech is more novel. \"If it's in an FBO account, you don't even know who the end customer is, you just have this giant account,\" said LendingClub's Sanborn. \"You're trusting the fintech to do the work.\" While McWilliams has floated a partial payment to end users weeks ago, an idea that has support from Yotta co-founder Moelis and others, that hasn't happened yet. Getting consensus from the banks has proven difficult, and the bankruptcy judge has openly mused about which regulator or body of government can force them to act. The case is \"uncharted territory,\" Judge Martin Barash said, and because depositors' funds aren't the property of the Synapse estate, Barash said it wasn't clear what his court could do. Evolve has said in filings that it has \"great pause\" about making any payments until a full reconciliation happens. It has further said that Synapse ledgers show that nearly all of the deposits held for Yotta were missing, while Synapse has said that Evolve holds the funds. \"I don't know who's right or who's wrong,\" Moelis told CNBC. \"We know how much money came into the system, and we are certain that that's the correct number. The money doesn't just disappear; it has to be somewhere.\" In the meantime, the former Synapse CEO and Evolve have had an eventful few weeks. Pathak, who dialed into early bankruptcy hearings while in Santorini, Greece, has since been attempting to raise funds for a new robotics startup, using marketing materials with misleading claims about its ties with automaker General Motors. And only days after being censured by the Federal Reserve about its management of technology partners, Evolve was attacked by Russian hackers who posted user data from an array of fintech firms, including Social Security numbers, to a dark web forum for criminals.\n\nNatasha Craft, a 25-year-old FedEx driver from Mishawaka, Indiana.

    "body": "The drive-thru menu at a McDonald's restaurant showing various meal options and promotions, in Buttonwillow in Kern County, California, on 23, 2024.\n\nSearching for ways to lower labor costs, restaurants are hoping that artificial intelligence can take down drive-thru orders \u2014 but it will likely be years before the technology becomes widely available.\n\nThis year, 16% of restaurant operators plan to invest in artificial intelligence, including voice recognition, according to a survey from the National Restaurant Association. Most of the big spending comes from large chains, which have the capital and scale to make the technology work for their businesses.\n\nEven before the pandemic, labor costs had been rising for restaurants, leading operators to look to technology to boost their profit margins. Then Covid came, which not only accelerated labor costs but also led to a shift away from dining rooms and toward drive-thru lanes. California's decision earlier this year to hike wages for fast-food workers to $20 an hour has only made operators more inclined to embrace technology to cut their labor costs, which has so far helped mostly in the automation of back-of-the-house tasks.\n\nAt the same time, ChatGPT and other AI tools have fueled new excitement for generative AI in restaurants, though the industry is typically slow to embrace technological advances.\n\nOne stumbling block for the burgeoning tech came in June, when McDonald's told its franchisees that it would end its trial of Automated Order Taker, AI technology meant for its drive-thru lanes through a partnership with IBM. Once an early mover in the voice-ordering race, the fast-food giant now plans to turn to other vendors.\n\nThen there's Presto Automation , the AI drive-thru technology company which disclosed last year in Securities and Exchange Commission filings that it uses \"human agents\" in places like the Philippines and India to complete orders. Presto interim CEO Gee Lefevre maintains that using humans is common in the AI industry and helps train the technology without straining the restaurant's workforce. The company unveiled a fully autonomous version in May. Still, the initial lack of transparency may scare off some operators.\n\nWhile some restaurants may be skeptical of using AI for drive-thrus now, adoption may increase in the coming months and years.\n\nThe tipping point for voice ordering is likely in 12 to 18 months, according to T.D. Cowen analyst Andrew Charles. That's when he thinks at least two of the nation's top 25 restaurant chains will go all in, expanding their small trial runs of the technology across their footprints.\n\n\"It's like third-party delivery a few years ago: Everyone was testing it, then when McDonald's went with Uber, everyone else followed with their own partnerships,\" Charles said.\n\nThis time, McDonald's likely won't be the first mover.",

    "title": "Concerns grow over gambling addiction in the military",
    "body": "watch now\n\nIn the wake of 9/11 on an American military base in South Korea, then-Army Staff Sergeant Dave Yeager sat down at a slot machine operated by the Defense Department and made what he now calls the biggest mistake a budding problem gambler can make: He won. \"All that stress, all that tension, all the things that I was carrying with me in that moment went away,\" Yeager told CNBC. What was supposed to be entertainment, a way for servicemembers to relax, instead for Yeager grew into a disorder that would cost him his career, his financial security and his family. \"It went from, I was have fun doing this, to, I have to do this. It became an obsession for me,\" he said. In his book, \"Fall In: A Veteran with a Gambling Addiction,\" Yeager wrote about how he borrowed from subordinates, stole from petty cash and left his family in a lurch financially. Such vulnerability in a servicemember affects individual readiness and potentially even national security, if enemies were to exploit it, he pointed out.\n\nDave Yeager got hooked on slot machines when he was deployed to South Korea. Today, he counsels others about gambling disorder. CNBC\n\nYet, when Yeager said he confessed of that vulnerability to his commanders and his counselors, no one pointed the finger at his gambling, or helped him to help himself. \"The chaplain told me to go to bingo night on Sunday. That would give me something to do,\" Yeager said. \"And I'm like, 'I think you're missing the point here.'\" As of 2017, the Department of Defense operated more than 3,100 slot machines on U.S. military installations in a dozen foreign countries, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office. The machines produce more than $100 million annually in revenue and is seen as a morale booster for the welfare and recreation for servicemembers akin to activities like golf, libraries and other entertainment. Overseas, servicemembers as young as 18 may be permitted to gamble. Domestically, slot machines are prohibited on military bases, though casinos are frequently located nearby. There are seven local casinos located within 20 minutes from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, one of the country's largest military installations. In 2018, when a Supreme Court decision paved the way for states to legalize sports betting, the opportunities for wagering exploded. Now, more broadly, all but four states permit gambling in some form. \"All of a sudden, we started to see a lot of people with gambling problems calling and asking for some help, usually within a year or two from the time that it expanded,\" said Heather Chapman, a clinical psychologist and director of the national gambling treatment program for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Diagnoses of pathological gambling disorders among servicemembers and veterans is soaring, with more patients receiving a diagnosis in the first half of 2024 as in all of 2022, according to VA research. Twenty percent of those referrals are women. \"It's not terribly surprising, because with accessibility and availability increases, we tend to see a rise in unhealthy engagement,\" said Dominick DePhilippis, deputy national mental health director for substance abuse disorders for the VA.\n\nServicemembers are more vulnerable than civilians to gambling disorders and may be hesitant to self-report, fearing they could lose their security clearance or to avoid the stigma attached to gambling problems, the VA research found. Studies have found the prevalence of problem gambling and gambling disorder among veterans to be as high as 10.7% in some parts of the U.S., the department said, though those studies have been smaller and typically regional, which leads to a wide variance among results. To address the growing concern, the VA operates two residential treatment facilities for gambling addiction and has a myriad partnerships with civilian facilities throughout the country, Chapman said. \"We are sort of the mecca of gambling treatment,\" she said. The VA began treating gambling disorders in the late 1960s, about nine years after Congress banned slot machines from domestic bases. The Department of Defense declined CNBC's request for an interview, but said in a statement there hasn't been any systemwide increases in resources to address problem gambling. It said a Health Related Behavior survey from 2018 \u2014 before the boom in sports betting \u2014 indicated that rates of problem gambling among servicemembers of 1.6% to 1.7% was in line with the incidence in the civilian population. \"DoD researchers are aware of changes in gambling availability due to new mobile and sports gambling options and will consider these variables in future military gambling research,\" a department spokesperson said in an email. The military is conducting a new survey, with results expected in the fall, the spokesperson added\n\nThe Department of Defense operates slot machines on military bases abroad.

    "title": "Constellation delivers beer profits, but weakness in wine prompts a downgrade",
    "body": "Constellation Brands reported an earnings beat on Wednesday that was driven by strength in its beer business. However, shares fell 4% after an initial move up, as investors \u2014 including us \u2014 remain troubled by continued weakness in the wines and spirits business. Comparable net sales for the three months ended May 31 increased 6% year over year to $2.662 billion, missing Wall Street's expectations of $2.671 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) increased 17% compared with the same period last year, to $3.57, a beat versus the $3.46 per share predicted by analysts. Constellation Brands Why we own it : We like Constellation Brands for its beer franchise, which includes popular Mexican brands Modelo, Corona and Pacifico. We would like Constellation to concentrate on beer and divest its wine and spirits business. Competitors : Anheuser-Busch Inbev and Molson Coors Weight in Club portfolio : 2.5% Most recent buy : April 16, 2024 Initiated: May 5, 2022 Bottom line This quarter reaffirmed our belief that Constellation has a great beer business that is weighed down by its wine-and-spirits unit. While overall sales came up short, CEO Bill Newlands said it still beat the overall consumer packaged goods growth by 4.5 percentage points. That outperformance was largely driven by the growth of its beer business, which attained the second largest share gain in the entire beverage industry and the top share gain in alcoholic beverages. We were again pleased to see that the increase in beer sales was driven by strong growth in shipment volume. Remember, the ability to grow sales via increased volume is crucial given the inflationary dynamics we've had to deal with coming out of Covid. That's because consumers are starting to push back on high prices. The ability to grow sales via increased volumes alleviates some pressure on management to take action on prices, a key factor that should help the company continue gaining market share. Operating cash flow came in light, but free cash flow was largely in line with expectations. As members know, cash flow is the key to shareholder returns and indeed, management paid out $185 million in dividends during the quarter, while repurchasing $200 million worth of shares and repurchased another $40 million worth of shares in June. The team continues to target a net leverage ratio of 3 times by the end of the fiscal year. Management said it is working to right the wine-and-spirits business and expects to see improvements in the back half of the year as \"operational and commercial execution initiatives\" identified in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year and started in the first quarter of this year take hold. Guidance is in line with the expectation that weakness in the business is bottoming out. We maintain the view that a rebound or divestiture of the wine-and-spirits segment remains key to the stock reaching new highs. While we are sticking with the name given the strength in beer, we opted to trim our position and downgrade the stock to a 2 rating. We want to see actual progress before getting more positive on the trajectory of the stock from here. We are keeping our price target of $300. Quarterly results Constellation's wine-and-spirits division remains a drag, with net sales falling 7% to $389 million, slightly below Street estimates, while operating income dropped 25% to around $60 million. Operating margin for the segment was down 370 basis points to 15.3%, worse than expectations. The weakness is attributable to lower volumes and higher costs of goods sold, which more than offset the benefits of lower operating expenses elsewhere. Shipment volumes declined 5.1% due to \"challenging\" market conditions, primarily in the U.S. wholesale channel. Depletions, a key metric that represents how much was product was sold to retailers by a distributor, were down 12.7% from a year ago. \"The tactical investments in the 11 brands that represent 75% of net sales and over 80% of volumes for our wine and spirits business in fiscal '24 are now underway, and we expect to see improvements in this select group of our most scaled offerings over the remainder of the year,\" the company said during its post-earnings call with investors. Beer segment results, on the other hand, remain largely positive. Though sales did come in a bit light versus estimates, the result still amounts to 8% year-over-year growth. Moreover, strong profitability led to a beat on operating income despite the topline miss. Operating margin expansion resulted from greater operating leverage (fixed costs were more spread out), along with benefits from ongoing cost-saving initiatives, and timing and efficiencies in marketing investments. Shipments increased 7.6% year over year. Depletions were up 6.4% versus the year-ago period, led by growth in Modelo Especial (11%), Pacifico (21%), and Modelo Chelada (over 5%). Citing Circana channel data, the company said its beer business was the top dollar sales share gainer for the 11 th consecutive quarter and the top volume share gainer in the total beer category in the U.S. Moreover, Constellations beer portfolio has 4 of the top 15 dollar share-gaining brands in the quarter. Guidance Management reaffirmed the guidance it gave in the previous quarter. Net sales are expected to increase 6% to 7%, driven by 7% to 9% growth in beer. Sales of wine and spirits are pegged at down 0.5% to up 0.5%. Enterprise operating income is expected to increase 10% to 12% on a comparable basis, with beer up 10% to 12% and wine and spirits down 9% to 11%. Management expects comparable earnings to be $13.50 to $13.80 per share. Operating cash flow is forecasted to land between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion, with free cash flow of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, after accounting for $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion on capital expenditures, with $1.2 billion of that targeted to support capacity additions to its Mexican beer operations.

    "body": "Private payroll growth edged lower in June, according to a report Wednesday from ADP that indicates a potential slowdown in the U.S. labor market.\n\nCompanies added 150,000 jobs for the month, below the upwardly revised 157,000 in May and the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 160,000. The total was the lowest monthly gain since January.\n\nWithout the surge in leisure and hospitality hiring, the total would have been considerably lower. The sector added 63,000 jobs, easily the biggest gain among the categories that payrolls processing firm ADP measures.\n\nOther sectors showing gains included construction (27,000), professional and business services (25,000), other services (16,000), and trade, transportation and utilities (15,000).\n\nOn the downside, natural resources and mining showed a decline of 8,000, manufacturing lost 5,000, and information was off 3,000.\n\n\"Job growth has been solid, but not broad-based,\" ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. \"Had it not been for a rebound in hiring in leisure and hospitality, June would have been a downbeat month.\"\n\nThe pace of wage gains also moved lower for those who stayed in their jobs, down to 4.9% on a year-over-year basis for the smallest rise since August 2021. Job switchers saw a 7.7% increase, a number that also has been trending lower.\n\nThe bulk of job creation came from companies that employ 50-499 workers, a group that added 88,000 on the month. Small businesses contributed just 5,000. Geographically, 80,000 jobs came from the South, or more than half the total.\n\nADP's report serves as a precursor to the more closely watched nonfarm payrolls count that the Labor Department will release Friday. That report is expected to show an addition of 200,000 jobs, following May's 272,000.\n\nThe two reports often differ, sometimes substantially, with ADP consistently undershooting the Bureau of Labor Statistics count. For May, the BLS reported that private payrolls rose by 229,000, or 72,000 more than ADP's estimate.",

    "body": "China's increasing worldwide influence is a major debate in this presidential election year. It centers on whether the Chinese Communist Party is viewed as a friendly competitor or an enemy of the United States.\n\nRecently, investigative journalist and author Peter Schweizer detailed China's efforts to undermine America from within.\n\nSchweizer contends Communist China is at war with America, sowing chaos and death without firing a shot. He makes that argument in the book Blood Money: Why the Powerful Turn a Blind Eye While China Kills Americans.\n\n\"China has a strategy, they call it disintegration warfare that says, look, we don't want to have a kinetic fighting war with the United States because that would lead to all kinds of disruption and damage in China,\" Schweizer explained. \"So, we're going to try to beat them by not going to war, but by undermining them nonetheless.\"\n\nSchweizer believes that the Chinese Communist Party undermines America by employing the tactics of Sun Tzu, a fifth-century Chinese military strategist who argued that an enemy can be defeated without actual combat.\n\n\"They're doing this by sowing social chaos in the United States,\" Schweizer warned. \"They're literally killing Americans with fentanyl. All the Mexican cartels are the junior partners. This is a Chinese operation.\"\n\nLATEST: Unprecedented Discovery at Southern US Border Exposes Chinese Criminal Alliance with Sinaloa Cartel\n\nSchweizer claims to have found links between the Biden family and the head of a Chinese gang involved in Mexican fentanyl distribution, Zhang Anle, also known as \"White Wolf.\"\n\n\"White Wolf has a business partner who gave the Bidens in 2017 a $5 million forgivable loan that the Bidens have never repaid,\" Schweizer insisted. \"So, you literally have one degree of separation between the first family of the United States and this poisonous fentanyl trade.\"\n\nSchweizer believes that explains why President Biden has not been more aggressive in confronting China on the fentanyl issue.\n\n\"We need to remember that the bribery and corruption statutes in the United States say even if the actual politician doesn't get a dime, if his family member profits, that in and of itself is corruption,\" Schweizer said.\n\nAs fentanyl continued to pour across the U.S. southern border, the Centers for Disease Control released an alarming statistic: over 112,000 Americans lost their lives due to fentanyl overdose in 2023.\n\nSchweizer alleged it isn't only the Biden family that China is influencing. He believes China has financial ties with members of both major political parties in the United States, including outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Schweizer alleges that the family of McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, owns a shipping company called Foremost Shipping, which has grown and expanded due to its Chinese business connections.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.***\n\n\"If Mitch McConnell as a senator were to do or say something that particularly angered Beijing, they could destroy the family shipping business overnight,\" explained Schweizer. \"That's the kind of leverage they have and the kind of leverage that they use.\"\n\nAccording to Schweizer, the most surprising discovery in his book is the involvement of two Chinese billionaires in inciting division and chaos in American culture.\n\nHe argues that Roy Singham, the founder of Thoughtworks, and Joe Sy, the co-founder of Alibaba, have invested millions of dollars in radical cultural causes such as the transgender movement. Alibaba is a Chinese e-commerce company similar to Amazon.\n\n\"But unlike Amazon in the United States, this is a business that's closely wedded to the Chinese government,\" Schweizer explained. \"What's troubling about these actions is not only their support of the cause, but the fact that they don't actually advocate for these causes in China itself, which leads me to believe that they see it more as a disruptive force in American society than something that they actually embrace as a belief system.\"\n\nWhat can be done? Schweizer believes the country must first deal with Chinese political influence in Washington. After that, Americans need to be aware of what is going on. He said that if people stay informed and are equipped, they can win this war for American hearts and minds.\n\nMORE:",

    "body": "America's 'Explicit Covenant with God': How a Nation Pledged to God Can Save a World or Lose It\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Covenants are viewed as the most sacred and binding of deals \u2013 an oath that's never to be broken. America's earliest settlers made a covenant with God to serve and proclaim Him throughout the earth. These days, however, Americans appear to have forgotten this covenant and that can have dire consequences.\n\nChristian leader Dutch Sheets explained to CBN News how God's relationship with us is set by a sacred covenant.\n\nThis author of Giants Will Fall said, \"It's even what He based our salvation on: 'I'm coming to bring a new covenant through Jesus. The shedding of His blood ratifies this covenant.' It is a binding together that in Him is unbreakable.\"\n\nAmerica Began in Covenant\n\nEarly English settlers also wanted their new land to share such a binding covenant with God. Christian historian Eddie Hyatt, the author of The Great Prayer Awakening of 1857-58, said those who came to Jamestown starting in 1607 put it in their Virginia Compact.\n\n\"To propagate, to expand the gospel, the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to take the gospel to people who were 'lying in darkness and had no knowledge of the one true God.' They said that was the reason they had come,\" Hyatt stated.\n\nThe Pilgrims arriving in Massachusetts stated the same in 1620. Jerry Newcombe, the author of The Book That Made America, paraphrased what they wrote down: \"'Having undertaken a voyage for the glory of God and the advancement of the Christian faith.'\"\n\nNewcombe explained of the Pilgrims and Puritans who followed, \"They came for God as opposed to coming for gold.\"\n\nHyatt says John Winthrop, leading 700 Puritans to Massachusetts in 1631, said it like this: \"'Others may come to the New World for wealth and furs.' He said, 'We have another goal, another end. We have entered into an explicit covenant with God to be His people in this New World.' And they wanted to be that city on a hill. They wanted to be a model of Christianity for the rest of the world to see.\"\n\nDavid Barton of Wallbuilders said as these early settlers wrote out their covenants, \"They were very cognizant of the fact that we answer to God. We need to get God at the center of what we do. If we do, He'll bless us. If we don't, we're in trouble.\"\n\nThese Covenants Became Models for the US Constitution\n\nThese early covenants pledged the signers to each other and to obeying the laws they'd form with God's guidance.\n\nAs Newcombe put it, \"This was something that would bind each man and each person to the whole community as an agreement under God.\"\n\nAccording to historian William Federer, such compacts became the model for the US Constitution, whose authors were also very much guided by their Christian faith.\n\nThe writer of the online AmericanMinute.com stated, \"George Washington at the beginning of the Constitutional Convention, he said 'the event is in the hand of God.'\"\n\nHow Has America's Constitution Lasted So Long?\n\n\"They saw the Constitution as being a very religiously-based document,\" said Barton. \"It was also a very covenantal-based document. We made a covenant. The Constitution is a covenant of these states.\"\n\nHe went on, \"The average length of a constitution in the history of the world was 17 years. So how have we gone 230 when everybody else was going 17? And so political science professors looked to see where the Founders got their ideas.\"\n\nBarton pointed out they studied 3,154 direct quotes from these Founders' political writings and discovered how much God's Word figured in them.\n\nHe summed up, \"The number one source was the Bible: 34 percent of all those quotes in those political documents, etc., came out of the Bible.\"\n\nSheets explains in his book Giants Will Fall that the makeup of the government was shaped by biblical passages like Isaiah 33:22, writing, \"Our nation's form of government was actually taken from scripture. 'The Lord is our Judge {Judicial Branch}\u2026Lawgiver {Legislative Branch}\u2026and King {Executive Branch}.'\"\n\nThe Founders put God first and foremost in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nFederer stated, \"It says right in there 'appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world.' In this founding document, we appealed to God. We invited Him to be a part of this American experiment.\"\n\nThe Founders put Scripture on the Liberty Bell, Leviticus 25:10: \"Proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof\u2026\"\n\nThe concept of this being one nation UNDER God harkens back to Jesus telling Jerusalem in Luke 13:34 that He wanted to \"\u2026hide you UNDER my wings, covering and protecting you.\"\n\nDire Consequences of Deserting Covenant\n\nWhat happens though, as parts of the nation don't want to be under God, disregard parts of the Constitution, and no longer honor sacred oaths?\n\nSheets warned, \"We have walked away from covenant with Him.\"\n\nAnd even from the marriage covenant, with the divorce rate soaring 302 percent in the 20th century.\n\nNewcombe argued, \"A lot of the things that we're experiencing in America today are because we've disregarded God's covenant.\"\n\nAmerica, once the number one exporter of the Gospel, is now the number one importer of illegal drugs and the number one exporter of pornography.\n\nNewcombe explained God warned about this, saying, \"'Obey me then I will bless you. But if you disobey me, I will remove my blessing.'\"\n\nSo Much Is on the Line\n\nIf America really is to be the place from which the Gospel is spread to the whole world, then the salvation of billions hangs in the balance.\n\nSheets believes there's hope, but only if Americans return to honoring their covenant with God, because that makes us His family.\n\nSheets gave an example, saying, \"If the kids across the street I don't know, if they do something evil or wrong, I feel no responsibility to try to bring them back into the fold, because I'm not in covenant with them. I'm not in that relationship. God is the same way.\"\n\nBarton pointed out the long-suffering faithfulness of the Lord, saying, \"We're told in Psalm 105 He keeps His covenant for a thousand generations.\"\n\nSheets added, \"I don't think there's a stronger force in the world.\"\n\nSo there's a chance the nation can still someday completely fulfill the prophecy of destiny Jamestown chaplain Robert Hunt said in 1607 as he came ashore in Virginia, just a few miles from where the Christian Broadcasting Network\u2019s headquarters are located.\n\nHyatt explained, \"He made this declaration which I believe was prophetic. He said, 'From these very shores the Gospel shall go forth, not only to this New World but to all the world.' And that was just not very far from CBN!\"\n\nIt just takes getting back to covenant. As Joel 2:13 says, \"Now return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in loving-kindness.\"",

    "body": "The Founders Meant to Keep Government Out of the Church, Not God Out of the Government\n\nThe 4th of July makes us think of our independence and freedoms. And recent legal battles over religious liberty in the U.S.A. raise serious questions about the freedom to worship in America. So when our Founders came up with the First Amendment, were they trying to keep the government free from religion, or religion free from government?\n\nThese days, the phrase \"wall of separation between church and state\" has come to mean keeping God or His believers from having a big effect on government and public life. But that\u2019s far, far from what the Founding Fathers were thinking of when they were separating church and state.\n\nFear of an All-Powerful State Church Wed to the Power of the Government\n\nThey were afraid of what so many of the Old World countries had: a religion established by the state as its one true religion, that would tyrannically rule over the faith and conscience of every citizen.\n\nAs the Providence Forum\u2019s Peter Lillback put it, \u201cThey recognized having a monolithic church was a dangerous thing.\u201d That's because it made the king not only their physical sovereign but also their all-powerful spiritual ruler.\n\nBefore the Pilgrims fled England, Wallbuilders' David Barton recalled, \u201cThe Pilgrims\u2019 pastor was executed because he made the statement that Jesus Christ is head of the church. And the monarch said, \u2018oh no, I\u2019m the head of the church. You\u2019re dead.\u2019\u201d\n\nWouldn't Allow a Church of America Like the Brits Had the Church of England\n\nKnowing of such terror and tyranny, AmericanMinute.com historian William Federer explained how the Founders felt: \"Their big fear was the federal government was going to follow the blueprint of every country in Europe and pick one national denomination.\"\n\nSo what they meant by saying in the First Amendment \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\" was that the federal government was banned from creating \u2013 or \"establishing\" \u2013 a national religion with the national government wedded to it.\n\n\"They didn't want to have a national, established Church of America like you have the Church of England, forcing people to believe something that they didn't believe in,\" said Jerry Newcombe, host of the radio program \"Vocal Point\".\n\n\u201cWhat they said was, 'We don't want a state church here. Consciously, therefore, they were separating the church from government,\" Lillback said.\n\nBut that was strictly to protect the churches and each believer\u2019s faith and conscience from the government.\n\nAll About Protecting Each American's Conscience and Freedom to Believe\n\nNot only did the First Amendment say, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" but it also said, \"or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n\n\"What they wanted was the freedom that we have in the Bible: the rights of conscience,\" Barton said. \"And they didn't want the state telling us how we could or couldn't practice our faith.\"\n\nLillback said the Founders keeping government control away from faith meant, \"Each of us has a right to be who we are before God. It has been well said and it's a classic statement of religious liberty that man is not free unless he is free on the inside. We have to have the freedom to believe what we believe. That's what the First Amendment protects.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\n'God: He's on Both Sides of the Wall'\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Christian historian Eddie Hyatt explained Thomas Jefferson was talking about when he wrote the letter that first used the famous \"wall of separation\" phrase to a group of worried Baptists.\n\n\"He said that the First Amendment had erected a wall of separation that would protect them from any intrusion of the government,\" Hyatt stated. \"In Jefferson's mind, the wall of separation was a uni-directional wall, put there to keep the government out of the church; not to keep the influence of the church out of the government.\"\n\nThere was no antipathy towards the Lord in all of this, Lillback insisted, saying, \u201cBut the idea of God: He\u2019s on both sides of the wall. And He\u2019s welcome there. And He should be.\u201d\n\nThe Government Is Reaching Over that Wall, Bossing Around People of Faith\n\nBut today, there's been a complete flip.\n\nLillback said, \u201cThose who once believed in this really high and impregnable wall of church and state, we now see the government reaching over that wall and saying, \u2018but don\u2019t preach that text of scripture.\u2019\u201d\n\nSTAY UP TO DATE WITH THE FREE CBN NEWS APP\n\nClick Here Get the App with Special Alerts on Breaking News and Top Stories\n\nBarton added, \u201cAll of a sudden the government\u2019s regulating religious activities, which is what Jefferson said they would not do because of separation of church and state.\u201d\n\nHyatt lamented, \u201cThe Founders would be so distressed to see how that statement has been turned on its head.\u201d\n\nAs Newcombe explained, \"They absolutely did not mean the separation of God and government, which is what's often being practiced today.\"\n\nNo One 'Under Government,' but Each One 'Under God'\n\nLillback encourages Americans to remember what the nation's Founders intended.\n\n\u201cThis is a theistic government. So God was not separated from government,\" he insisted. \"So any interpretation of the First Amendment that takes God out of government is turning the whole story on its head. Rather it was taking a formal state church out of the equation, leaving it up to each individual. But all, as we still say, 'under God.' That was the view of our Founders.\"\n\nThey believed a nation based on liberty could only stay free if its citizens were godly people. As Barton pointed out, believers in God have their eyes on eternity, and it makes them practice self-control.\n\nKnowing You'll Answer to God Makes You Govern Yourself\n\n\"When you\u2019re God-conscious, you realize, \u2018ya know, I\u2019m going to have to answer to Him for what I do,\u2019 and it limits my bad behavior,\" Barton stated.\n\nNewcombe added, \u201cThat\u2019s something the Founders believed very strongly: that we\u2019re going to be accountable before God.\u201d\n\nHyatt said of those Founders, \"They knew that they were creating a nation for a free people, but also for a virtuous people who would govern themselves from within.\"\n\nYou need very little police power if people, because of conscience, will police themselves.\n\nGreen Bean Control Laws?\n\n\"Self-control is what you need,\" Barton explained. \"We can pass all the control laws we want. But unless you control the heart, you'll never control behavior. I mean, I can kill somebody with a can of green beans. What are we going to do? Pass green bean control laws if somebody does that? No. It's on the inside.\"\n\nAnd the Founders knew to keep America true and free, they also needed the perfect law of a loving, all-wise God.\n\nAs Lillback put it, \u201cThere was a clear understanding that the government needed to have an ultimate check and balance, even beyond the people that ran it and their elections. And that is the transcendent law of God. And so that is why when we look at our Declaration of Independence, there are four references to Deity.\u201d\n\nGoing through the Declaration, Lillback laid them out: \"'We're endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.' The laws of God and nature. And it tells us there's an appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world. And, finally, a dependence on the Providence of God. Four references to Deity.\"\n\nNot Godless at All\n\nBut then came the US Constitution, which some say is a godless document because God isn\u2019t mentioned in it. As soon as they were done with it, though, the Founders called for a day of Thanksgiving to God.\n\n\"They were not thinking 'let's get rid of God',\" Lillback stated. \"They said 'We have been given now a new Constitution, and now amendments that give us our freedoms. And where do we turn? We turn to heaven and thank God for this'.\"\n\n\"Now, if their intent was to get rid of God from government, boy did they miss their point,\" Lillback said. \"Because they turned around and thanked Him for everything that they had. It shows the utter historical absurdity of 'the godless Constitution'.\"\n\nConstitution's Last Words Reference Christ\n\nAnd God isn\u2019t really absent from the Constitution or its authors\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cThey are not godless,\" Lillback insisted. \"They are people who at the very end of their work said \u2018In the year of our Lord, 1787.\u2019 The very last words in the Constitution are a reference to Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise then that the ultimate motto is We are One Nation Under God.\u201d\n\n*This story was originally published in July 2020.",

    "body": "Hurricane Beryl Roars Toward Jamaica after Killing at Least 6 People in Southeast Caribbean\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) - Hurricane Beryl was roaring toward Jamaica on Wednesday, with islanders scrambling to make preparations after the powerful Category 4 storm earlier killed at least six people and caused significant damage in the southeast Caribbean.\n\nIn Kingston, people boarded up windows, fishermen pulled their boats out of the water before sitting around a table to play dominoes beside a bay, and workers dismantled roadside advertising boards to protect them from the expected lashing winds to come.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near or over Jamaica on Wednesday, near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Haiti's southern coast and the Yucatan\u2019s east coast. Belize issued a tropical storm watch stretching south from its border with Mexico to Belize City.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. Early Wednesday, the storm was about 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of Kingston. It had maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph), the center said.\n\nBeryl was expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica, where officials warned residents in flood-prone areas to prepare for evacuation.\n\n\u201cI am encouraging all Jamaicans to take the hurricane as a serious threat,\u201d Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a public address Tuesday. \u201cIt is, however, not a time to panic.\u201d\n\nIn Miami, U.S. National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said Jamaica appears to be in the direct path of Beryl. He urged residents to find a safe place to shelter and stay there through Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are most concerned about Jamaica, where we are expecting the core of a major hurricane to pass near or over the island,\u201d he said in an online briefing.\n\nStorm surge of 6-9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) above typical tide levels are likely in Jamaica, as well as heavy rainfall.\n\nA tropical storm warning was in place for the entire southern coast of Hispaniola, an island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Two other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press. She said Carriacou and Petit Martinique sustained the greatest damage, with scores of homes and businesses flattened in Carriacou.\n\nGrenada's prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \u201cremains a grim reality.\u201d\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago. He noted that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed, and that \u201csimilar levels of devastation\u201d were expected on the islands of Myreau and Canouan.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\nGrenada, known as the \u201cspice isle,\u201d is one of the world's top exporters of nutmeg. Mitchell noted that the bulk of the spices are grown in the northern part of the island, which was hit hardest by Beryl.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

    "body": "Recent events in the Middle East are causing additional hardship and suffering for Christians in Yemen.\n\nFor years, the tiny group of believers there have withstood intense persecution from militant Muslims and their government. Now, the attacks on ships and other actions of Houthi rebels are making matters worse.\n\nThe Houthi movement began about thirty years ago as an insurgency against the Sunni Muslim government. Armed by Iran, the Shia Muslim militia is crucial to Tehran's strategy to dominate the Middle East and control shipping lanes by restricting access to the Red Sea.\n\nREAD Houthi Strike Brings Death at Sea\n\nDuring recent testimony before Congress, former CIA intelligence analyst and Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute Dr. Kenneth Pollack said the Houthis share Iran's goal of destroying Israel and driving the United States and its allies out of the Middle East.\n\n\"The Houthis have proven themselves to be belligerent, aggressive, and convinced that violence is the best way to get what they want,\" Pollack insisted. \"They are forces of oppression inside Yemen and forces of aggression beyond it.\"\n\nYemen's small but growing community of Christians is among those targeted by the Houthis.\n\n\"The Christians in this area are folks that were formerly Muslim \u2013Muslim background believers that have converted to Christianity. Christians are obviously a despised, minority,\" explained Open Doors U.S. CEO Ryan Brown.\n\nBrown's group lists Yemen as the world's fifth worst persecutor of Christians on its 2024 World Watch list.\n\nHe said years of war had left the people largely dependent upon outside aid. So, when shipping lanes are disrupted, food and other necessities are slow to reach Middle Eastern ports, driving up costs, and Christians \u2013 those refusing to wage jihad or engage in Islamic practices are marginalized.\n\n\"Christians are often last in line as it relates to being able to receive the care and attention there as war and as these things continue to escalate. That has a ripple effect and economic ripple effect. It can disrupt supply chains, and so, while Christians were already last line, that line becomes even further elongated,\" explained Brown. \"And so Christians are very much impacted by what's going on currently.\"\n\nOnce they leave Islam and are baptized, Yemeni Christians are considered apostates by Muslims. So, they keep their new faith secret to avoid severe persecution and possibly death at the hands of their clan or family members.\n\nAnd if they are not killed for their faith, they are often blamed for their connections to the West.\n\n\"They become easy targets,\" said Brown. \"You know, there is Al-Qaeda presence in the South, Houthi presence in the North, and Christians are seen as enemies on all fronts there.\"\n\nBrown said although many Yemenis are frightened, they are also curious and asking questions about faith. Followers of Jesus respond with the Word of God.\n\nHe advises the body of Christ to pray for their Yemeni brothers and sisters in Christ, \"That even in the midst of this conflict, that they would see peace and they would see security, but they would recognize that in the midst of this conflict, God is doing incredible things, that his purposes are advancing, and the church is advancing there.\"",

    "body": "Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF), responsible for Israel\u2019s forests, held a tree planting ceremony in memory of Druze soldiers who have given their lives in the current Iron Swords War.\n\n\"The Druze community's journey of mourning since the beginning of the war is a journey of mourning for the entire nation,\u201d Shaykh Mowafaq Tarif, the Spiritual Leader of the Druze Community in Israel said at the ceremony.\n\nYet, thanks to this journey, we can maintain normalcy in the country. KKL-JNF's initiative is a touching and significant gesture \u2013 planting trees in memory of the fallen here in the Galilee, where the roots of the Druze community have been planted for nearly a thousand years,\u201d Shaykh Tarif added.\n\nThere are about 143,000 Druze citizens living in northern Israel, including the Golan Heights. The men are all required to join the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), at about age 18, like Israeli Jewish men.\n\nNine Druze soldiers are among the more than 670 Israeli soldiers that have fallen in battle since the October 7th war, dubbed Iron Swords, began.\n\n\u201cThe Druze community has walked hand in hand with KKL-JNF for years. Our relationship is deeply rooted and important, covering a range of fields and topics,\u201d said KKL-JNF Chairwoman, Ifat Ovadia-Luski.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that today's tree-planting commemoration provides the bereaved families a place of solace, a piece of land that will grow and flourish. I believe that today's ceremony and our ongoing activities with the Druze community will continue to deepen our important connection,\u201d Ovadia-Luski said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, the families planted olive trees in the KKL-JNF Ahihud Forest in northern Israel to honor their loved ones who fell while defending the country.\n\n\u201cOur sons sacrificed themselves for the security of the state. For us Druze, this is our country too, and it is our duty to protect and defend it,\u201d said Imad Habka father of Lieutenant Colonel Salman Habka from Yanuh-Jat village. Salman Habka was commander of the 53rd battalion in the Barak Brigade and fell in battle in the northern Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cWe sacrificed our dearest loved ones, who left behind grieving families, parents, wives, and children. They deserve to be commemorated and remembered at every opportunity. KKL-JNF's dedication to their memory is deeply moving, and this way, everyone has a place to honor our sons,\u201d said Imad.\n\n\u201cThe planted trees will stand as living testimony to the bravery of the fallen and symbolize the partnership between Druze and Jews. KKL-JNF, as a national institution of the Jewish people, believes in and desires a partnership with the Druze community,\u201d said Shaykh Tarif.\n\n\u201cThe country is no longer the same as it was before but remains in the covenant between the Jewish people and the Druze community, a covenant created by exceptional individuals whom we remember today and will always remember,\u201d Shaykh Tarif added.\n\n\u201cI hope that this beautiful site will mark a new path in the relations between the community and the Jewish people, thanks to the fallen we commemorate and the shared belief that together we will strive for a better future,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to KKL-JNF, this planting underscores the preservation of their memory alongside KKL-JNF's \u201cvalues of growth and renewal.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the war, KKL-JNF held a tree planting event in memory of those murdered at the site of the Nova Music Festival. Relatives planted more than 300 trees there in honor of their loved ones who died on October 7th.\n\nOver the years, KKL-JNF has created various projects to strengthen ties with the Druze community. One of them is called the \"Paths of Sons\", which spans about 250 km (155 miles), connecting Druze villages on Mt. Carmel and in the Galilee, featuring 18 initial landmark stones.\n\nEach year, tens of thousands of participants join a race that follows the \u201cPaths of Sons.\u201d\n\nAnother project, \u201cCovenant of Brothers, Covenant of Life\u201d, which began in 2016, marks \u201cthe special bond between the Druze community and the State of Israel\u201d and takes place in the Ahihud Forest. Hundreds of youth march here each year to express \u201ccentral values of brotherhood, cooperation, and hope for a shared future,\u201d KKL-JNF says.",

From the beginning, we have said that we support Gaza,\u201d he told The Associated Press at the group\u2019s political office in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs.\n\nExperts say a full-scale war would devastate Lebanon and cause major destruction inside Israel. Still, without a diplomatic solution or military campaign to drive Hezbollah back, it's unlikely Israeli citizens can return home.\n\nSheikh Insists Halt to Fighting in Gaza Would End Hezbollah Attacks\n\nSo the sheikh says if Israel wants the daily attacks from Hezbollah to stop, it needs to cease fighting Hamas in Gaza.\n\nOr as he said of the Gaza war, \u201cIf the next phase is a cease-fire, we will stop firing in Lebanon.\"\n\nBut Kassam adds if Israel insists on war with his terror group, it could well spin out of control. It might even drag in other nations, like Hezbollah's sponsor Iran.\n\n'No One Knows the Repercussions'\n\nThe sheikh explained, \u201cNo one knows the repercussions of igniting the war locally, regionally, or even internationally.\"\n\nIsraeli officials are trying to head off a war with Hezbollah. But if war does come, they warn Israel will repeat in Lebanon the kind of massive destruction it's already brought to Gaza.\n\nIran Represents an Even Greater Danger to Israel\n\nOn Tuesday, the commander of Iran's Aerospace Force declared his soldiers are eager to launch another aerial assault on Israel.\n\nThe first happened on April 13th when Iran launched close to 350 projectiles against the Jewish state. Israel and an allied force, including the U.S., France, the UK, and Jordan, shot down nearly 99 percent of those weapons.",

    "body": "The EU is moving forward with plans to impose customs duty on cheap goods in a shift that could hit imports from online retailers and harm a hoped-for London listing by the fast-fashion seller Shein.\n\nThe potential change comes amid growing disquiet among retailers based in mainland Europe, the UK and the US about rising competition from the Chinese-linked marketplaces Shein and Temu, which exploit a loophole that excludes low-value items from import duty.\n\nIn the EU, the threshold for the levy is \u20ac150 (\u00a3127) and in the UK it is \u00a3135, enabling retailers such as Shein to ship products directly from overseas to shoppers in those markets without paying any import duty. In the UK, items valued at \u00a339 or less also do not attract import VAT.\n\nSubsidised postage costs in China make it more cost-effective for businesses based there to send cheap goods by air.\n\nA European Commission spokesperson said: \u201cIn May last year we put on the table customs reforms for a simple, smarter and safer customs union. What we have proposed now is there is no exemption any more for packages valued at below \u20ac150.\u201d\n\nThe e-commerce proposal must first be discussed and accepted by the European parliament, which sits again later this month.\n\nLast year, 2.3bn items below the duty-free \u20ac150 threshold were imported into the EU, according to a report in the Financial Times that highlighted the potential change.\n\nJohn Stevenson, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said that the impact of a change in the rules on Shein \u201cwould be huge depending on the territory\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Shein logo and web shop. Photograph: Dado Ruvi\u0107/Reuters\n\nSome countries imposed import duties of up to 30%, he said, and having to pay that would force Shein to either completely change its business model, put up prices or take a hit on profit.\n\n\u201cThe whole model is based on not paying duty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have a massive impact.\u201d\n\nStevenson was quite sceptical that EU countries would be able to close the loophole in the short term, given the complexity and cost of checking billions of parcels.\n\nHowever, he said the issue would be high on investors\u2019 list of concerns alongside potential ethical issues in its supply chain if Shein went ahead with launching a London listing, as is expected as early as this autumn.\n\nShein also faces increased competition from fellow social media-driven retailers including TikTok Shop and Temu, as well as the post-Covid return to the high street by shoppers, which has helped the likes of Primark.\n\nResearch from Earnest Analytics found that Shein shoppers in the US allocated 43% of their online discount spending to the brand last month compared with 66% a year ago, just before TikTok transactions began.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "body": "A landslide victory for Keir Starmer in the general election on Thursday could hand Britain a stability premium in global markets, boosting the pound, shares and investment in the UK at a time of mounting political turmoil elsewhere, City investors have said.\n\nIn sharp contrast with Conservative party warnings over the dangers of a large Labour majority, analysts in the City of London said the prospect of a resounding mandate for Starmer\u2019s party could secure Britain\u2019s \u201csafe haven\u201d status among investors in an increasingly volatile world.\n\nAfter failing to close the gap in opinion polls during the election campaign, Rishi Sunak made a last-ditch warning that a Starmer \u201csupermajority\u201d would \u201cbankrupt people in every generation\u201d.\n\nHowever, City analysts said a Labour landslide could pave the way for global investment in Britain after years of political and economic uncertainty since the 2016 Brexit referendum under the Tories, which had clouded the prospects for international investors.\n\nHighlighting mounting political instability on both sides of the Atlantic and the meltdown in financial markets triggered by Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget \u2013 when investors spoke of a \u201cmoron premium\u201d for Britain \u2013 City experts said a clear outcome on Thursday could return Britain to a steadier footing.\n\nNuwan Goonetilleke, the head of shareholder assets at Phoenix Group, which manages more than \u00a3280bn in investments, said money was already pouring into London-listed assets in anticipation of a Labour victory.\n\n\u201cThe UK is really being seen not just as a safe haven, but the safest of havens \u2013 especially in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the previous gyrations seen in the markets, whether that\u2019s Liz Truss or the leftwing policies from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour in 2019, we\u2019re not really seeing any of those wild swings now. That tells you how far the UK has come from Brexit when there were huge unknowns priced-in for the UK.\n\n\u201cWith a Labour majority, it continues to really double down on that promise of economic stability, growth and wealth creation.\u201d\n\nThe pound has rallied against the euro on global currency markets since Emmanuel Macron called snap elections in France in early June, in a development opening the door to a possible far-right victory or hung parliament in one of the EU\u2019s most powerful economies.\n\nJoshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, said: \u201cGiven the political shockwaves being felt around Europe, the prospect of a stable political environment could yet help place the UK economy as a haven for years to come.\u201d\n\nWhile UK government bond yields have remained stable in recent weeks, French borrowing costs have risen sharply. Investors said uncertainty over the outcome of the US presidential election in November had also bolstered UK assets.\n\nAny other result than a clear Labour victory would come as a shock in City dealing rooms after failure by Sunak to close a 20-point gap in opinion polls, which show the Conservatives on track for the party\u2019s worst defeat since at least 1906.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, some party insiders believe ditching Corbyn-era policies is important for wooing swing voters and tackling accusations of fiscal incompetence that have clung to the party since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe Labour leader and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, also argue that restoring political stability after years of Tory infighting \u2013 leading the party to its fourth prime minister since 2016 \u2013 could reinvigorate private investment in Britain, helping to meet his growth ambitions without the need for large tax rises or additional government borrowing.\n\nWhile Sunak has argued \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d taken under his premiership have helped the economy to \u201cturn a corner,\u201d which could enable interest rate cuts from the Bank of England, opinion polls suggest many voters are refusing to give him much credit after 14 years of Tory rule.\n\nMichael Browne, chief investment officer at the asset manager Martin Currie, said Britain\u2019s economy and financial markets could benefit from a period of stability under a Labour government that was \u201cmore moderate and international in tone\u201d.\n\nHe said the situation was comparable to 1997 when UK government bonds and sterling rallied in anticipation of Tony Blair\u2019s landslide victory. \u201cTo quote a well-known campaign slogan from 1997: \u2018Things can only get better.\u2019 With the current backdrop we would like to think so for the UK\u2019s equity assets.\u201d",

The decline in the ISM services index to 48.8 in June, from 53.8, takes it to its lowest since the lockdowns in 2020. Alongside a decline in the ISM manufacturing index, these surveys suggest that GDP growth will remain weak in the third quarter. They also add to evidence that labour demand is softening, and inflation will remain on a downward trend.

Leading the growth rankings for a second month running was the financials sector, where the rate of expansion in output picked up again to the sharpest since the end of 2021. Although returning to contraction territory for the second time in the last three months, technology firms recorded only a fractional drop in output in June. It was, nonetheless, the worst performing of the seven sectors. In contrast, the healthcare sector returned to growth in June, as output rose for the first time since March. Moreover, the rate of expansion in business activity was solid and the sharpest so far this year. The consumer goods and consumer services sectors saw differing trends during June, as growth in the latter accelerated to the fastest for two years. Meanwhile, consumer goods firms recorded the slowest upturn in output over the past six months. The basic materials sector saw an acceleration in the pace of output growth during June. Production levels rose at a solid rate that was the second-quickest since April 2022 (behind that seen in March 2024). Share\n\n4d ago 15.59 CEST US service sector growth picks up \u2013 S&P Global The US service sector picked up momentum in June, with the biggest rise in new orders in a year. Companies responded by taking on more staff for the first time in three months, but even so backlogs of work built up. Price pressures from both input costs and output prices eased in June, but remained above pre-pandemic averages, mainly because of higher labour costs. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global US services PMI business activity index increased for the second month running in June, to 55.3 from 54.8 in May. Activity in the sector has now risen in each of the past 17 months, with the latest expansion the most pronounced since April 2022. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: US service sector companies reported an encouragingly solid end to the second quarter, with output rising at the fastest rate for over two years. Both new order inflows and hiring have also accelerated, the latter buoyed by firms taking on more workers in response to rising backlogs of work. With additional \u2013 albeit more muted \u2013 support coming from the manufacturing sector, the survey data point to GDP rising at an annualised 2.0% rate in the second quarter, with a 2.5% rate seen for June. Forward momentum is therefore gathering pace. There is some nervousness creeping in regarding the post-election business environment, but for now at least confidence about the outlook for the coming year remains elevated by recent standards and supportive of businesses investing in expansion. Some of this optimism relates to ongoing convictions that interest rates will start to fall before the end of the year. In this respect, a further cooling of price pressures in the survey \u2013 notably in the services sector \u2013 adds to signs that inflation should trend lower in the coming months to open the door further for rate cuts. Share Updated at 16.21 CEST\n\n4d ago 15.48 CEST Baillie Gifford-run trust sells Rio Tinto stake An investment trust run by Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford has sold its \u00a320m stake in Rio Tinto, accusing the mining giant of not doing enough to tackle environmental and social concerns. Disclosure of the disposal by the FTSE 250-listed Monks Investment Trust, first reported by the Times, comes weeks after Baillie Gifford came under pressure from environmental activists in a row that led to it pulling out of sponsoring the Hay Edinburgh and other book festivals. Baillie Gifford pulled out after calls by campaign group Fossil Free Books (FFB) for the company to divest from fossil fuels and companies linked to Israel. Nine festivals that were previously sponsored by Baillie Gifford are now seeking donations, we reported earlier this week. Monks said on Tuesday that it would sell shares in companies that are not making enough progress on environmental, social and governance factors and named the mining group as a company it had ditched. Karl Sternberg, chair of Monks, said \u201cconcerns regarding governance and the approach to environmental impact\u201d had not been \u201cadequately addressed\u201d by the world\u2019s second-largest mining group. Monks first voiced concerns over Rio Tinto after it bulldozed a 46,000-year-old sacred Aboriginal site in Western Australia in 2020. The scandal triggered the departure of both Rio Tinto\u2019s chief executive and chair. Share\n\n4d ago 15.20 CEST US trade deficit widens slightly, labour market data softer US trade data and labour market figures are out. The trade deficit widened slightly to $75.1bn in May from $74.5bn, as exports fell by 0.7% month on month, countering a 0.3% decline in imports. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said: Nevertheless, the decline in exports was more modest than the advance goods data had implied, so net external demand should now be a slightly smaller (albeit still sizeable) drag on second-quarter GDP growth. Factoring in the disappointing May construction spending data released yesterday too, we now estimate that GDP growth was 1.9% annualised \u2013 a little stronger than the first quarter, but well below the economy\u2019s immigration-boosted potential growth rate. The $3.1bn decline in goods exports was driven by a $2.1bn drop in industrial supplies, which was partly linked to the fall in energy prices. The $1.9bn decline in goods imports was more than explained by a $4.2bn fall in pharmaceutical drugs, which tend to be quite volatile on a month-to-month basis. For the second quarter as a whole, we estimate that exports declined by 0.8% annualised, with imports up by 8.3%. The latest labour market data still look a little softer ahead of key June payrolls figures, due on Friday. ADP employment increased by a muted 150,000, and initial jobless claims edged up to 238,000, from 236,000. Alongside the news that GDP growth remained lacklustre in the first half of this year, this new-found labour market softness is a little disconcerting. Share\n\n4d ago 14.41 CEST Oil prices hit two-month high ahead of summer driving season Oil prices have climbed to a two-month high, ahead of the summer driving season, and amid renewed tensions in the Middle East. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose as high as $86.83 a barrel today, and is now trading at $86.41 a barrel, up 0.2% on the day. It has gained nearly $10 a barrel since the start of June. US light crude touched $83.36 a barrel and is now 0.2% higher at $82.97 a barrel, after pushing through $84 yesterday for the first time since April. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Oil prices are ticking upwards again, following a drop in US crude stockpiles for the week ending 28 June. Demand for fuel to power trips over the US holiday season is expected to be high. But traders are also eyeing potential supply constraints. Geo-political escalation in the Middle East is still a threat, given the ongoing violence in Gaza. The hurricane season forecast to be particularly fierce this year, given the devastation wreaked on the Caribbean this week and if severe storms hit the Gulf Coast, refining capacity could be significantly disrupted.

Syncona, a London-based life science investor that is listed on the FTSE 250, committed \u00a333.5m to the Series B financing, resulting in a \u00a314.1m uplift in its valuation of Beacon. (Series B financing is the second round of funding for a business through investment.) Syncona launched Beacon last year, after taking advantage of challenging biotech market conditions to acquire Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation off Nasdaq in 2022, and combining it with other pre-clinical programmes, including from the University of Oxford. Beacon, headquartered in London with another base in Massachusetts, focuses on developing gene therapies for both rare and prevalent diseases of the eye that lead to blindness, including X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD). Beacon\u2019s lead asset in XLRP is currently in intermediate to late-stage clinical trials. Share Updated at 14.11 CEST\n\n4d ago 12.47 CEST Eli Lilly's Kisunla is second Alzheimer's drug to get FDA approval The approval of Eli Lilly\u2019s Kisunla drug by the US health regulator means competition is heating up in the Alzheimer\u2019s drug market, analysts say. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday approved the experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drug donanemab, marketed as Kisunla, for the treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). The anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibody slowed the early stages of the fatal mind-robbing disease in studies. It is the second disease-modifying therapy to reach the AD market in the US, after Eisai/Biogen\u2019s Leqembi (Lecanemab) received full FDA approval last July. Philippa Salter, managing neurology analyst at the data and analytics firm GlobalData, forecast that Leqembi and Kisunla could generate global (US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Japan and China) sales of around $3.5bn and $2bn by 2030, respectively. She said: Despite gaining approval nearly a year ago, uptake of Leqembi has been slow. While the approval of Kisunla will provide further confidence [in this type of treatments], which could help drive the uptake of both drugs, many of the challenges faced by Leqembi will also apply to Kisunla. Both drugs require brain scans before treatment, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to assess levels of amyloid in the brain, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, with further MRI scans recommended prior to further drug infusions. She said access to these scans is a \u201ckey limiting factor for the uptake of these drugs\u201d. View image in fullscreen The Food and Drug Administration approved Eli Lilly\u2019s Kisunla on Tuesday, for mild or early cases of dementia caused by Alzheimer\u2019s. Photograph: AP Salter explained: The MRIs help monitor for a known side effect of these drugs, the development of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs). The rates of ARIA were lower in Leqembi\u2019s Phase III trials compared to Kisunla\u2019s Phase III trials, giving Leqembi a key advantage in its safety profile. However, an important competitive advantage for Kisunla is its once-monthly dosing schedule compared with Leqembi\u2019s dosing of once every two weeks. Further, despite having a higher annual cost of therapy of $32,000 for Kisunla compared with $26,500 per year for Leqembi, Lilly states that in the long term, Kisunla will be cheaper and more convenient for patients since they won\u2019t have to take the drug indefinitely, something that was included in the FDA label, which states that once amyloid plaques have been reduced to minimal levels on PET imaging, stopping treatment can be considered. While there are clear advantages in not having to take a drug indefinitely, many questions have been raised about what happens once donanemab therapy is stopped. Further real-world evidence and clinical trial data will be key for physicians to feel confident in stopping treatment with Kisunla and therefore vital for the success of the drug.

Vodafone is seeking to acquire Three UK in a deal which is currently being probed by competition regulators, but many aspects of the new network sharing agreement are independent of the outcome of the Vodafone UK and Three UK merger. The agreement will see a combined Vodafone UK and Three UK commit to invest \u00a311bn in its network for the next decade \u2013 although this will be subject to regulatory approval of the deal \u2013 as well as Virgin Media\u2019s \u00a32bn annual investment in its network. The two operators have agreed subject to completion of the merger, Virgin Media O2 will acquire spectrum from the newly enlarged Vodafone and Three UK group establishing three scaled mobile network operators each with better alignment of spectrum holding. Ahmed Essam, chief executive of European markets at Vodafone, said: With this agreement and our merger with Three, we will transform the mobile experience for over 50m customers in the UK for the long-term, providing significant network improvements including more choice, better quality and greater coverage across the country. Lutz Sch\u00fcler, chief executive of Virgin Media O2, said: We are extending and bolstering elements of our existing network sharing arrangement,while also ensuring there is a robust, balanced and functional structure in place for the long-term should Vodafone and Three\u2019s proposed merger gain consent.

The shares fell as low as 38p and later traded at 39.4p, down 4.2%. Total sales were 6.9% lower year on year in its third quarter, while the UK tile market is down between 10% and 15%, and the company said it was taking market share. Demand for repair, maintenance and improvement has remained weak, especially for bigger projects. Like-for-like sales were 9.7% lower in the third quarter, similar to the 9.2% decline seen in the first half, although sales levels stabilised somewhat through the quarter. Topps said that slowing inflation, a pick-up in real wage growth, improving consumer confidence and increased activity in the housing market \u201cprovides some confidence in a cyclical recovery\u201d. But it cautioned that this recovery is yet to feed through into its market, and it is working to improve its digital offer to trade customers and other measures.

There is growing confidence that a majority for Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally can be avoided in the second election round on Sunday, with political wrangling under way. France\u2019s CAC has gained around 1%, while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is 0.6% higher ahead of tomorrow\u2019s general election, Germany\u2019s Dax is also up by 0.6% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has risen by 1.3%. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at the trading platform Scope Markets, said: With President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist group and a left-wing alliance withdrawing candidates to minimise the number of three-way contests that might split the anti far-right vote, we have seen French [bond] yields head lower and stocks on the rise. With a hung parliament providing the basis for Macron to continue calling the shots, the market perception of a Le Pen victory comes down to the ability to achieve a majority or not. Tomorrow\u2019s UK election looks unlikely to create too many shockwaves given the sheer size of the majority expected for the Labour party. While Reform have been busy chipping away at the Conservative vote, recent scandals will have likely stifled support with two candidates defecting due to perceived racism within the party. For traders, the prospect of a stable Labour majority appears to be a positive, with sterling one of the best performing currencies over the past week. Looking ahead, the US jobs market remains in focus. Yesterday\u2019s JOLTS job openings data showed an unexpected rise counteracted by a downside revision to the May reading. Mahony said: With traders expecting a decline in Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls release, today\u2019s ADP figure looks to similarly head lower in a sign of weakness in the employment picture. The weakness seen for the dollar yesterday came off the back of comments from Powell, with the data dependent nature of the Fed being seen as a positive given the weakness expected in the jobs data this week. Nonetheless, traders will be concerned over the inflationary impact of the recent rise in crude oil, with yesterday\u2019s rise pushing WTI [West Texas Intermediate] through $84 for the first time since April. Share Updated at 14.38 CEST\n\n4d ago 10.44 CEST UK private sector growth at six-month low \u2013 PMI Expansion in the UK services sector slowed further in June with some evidence of a \u201cpre-election seize up\u201d feeding into a wider slowdown across the private sector to a six-month low, according to surveys. More momentum was lost in June, with the upturn at its weakest since last November as tomorrow\u2019s general election prompted some clients to adopt a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach before placing orders and commissioning new projects. New business intakes rose at a historically subdued pace, while the pace of job creation also eased. Meanwhile, firms\u2019 cost pressures continued to cool, but remained elevated. The rate of output price inflation accelerated slightly from May\u2019s recent low. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK services PMI business activity index remained in expansionary territory during June, posting 52.1. While this was the eighth consecutive monthly increase in output across the service sector, the headline index fell again, from 52.9 in May. Activity across the UK\u2019s private sector slowed to a six-month low. The composite output index, which pulls together the manufacturing and services surveys, remained in expansion territory at the end of the second quarter, but the pace of growth in business activity slowed for a second month running to its weakest in 2024 so far. At 52.3, down from 53.0 in May, the index was at a six-month low. Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: We are seeing some evidence of a pre-general election seize up across the UK services economy, with growth in business activity slowing to a seven-month low in June as the prospect of a change in government led to the adoption of a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach by some, restraining sales. Nevertheless, we\u2019re on track for another quarter of GDP growth, according to composite PMI data for the three months to June, albeit one that will be less punchy than the first quarter\u2019s 0.7%. Turning to prices and firms\u2019 costs, he said: Prices still continue to show a high degree of stickiness across the UK service sector, although input cost inflation once again trended lower in June. The direction of travel here is encouraging for the Bank of England, but our survey\u2019s gauge of prices charged actually rose on the month as some companies noted their pricing power was strong enough to raise their fees. While costs, mostly from wages, have been the major driving force behind strong services inflation, the recovery of the UK economy from it\u2019s late-2023 lull adds another dynamic for policymakers to consider should stronger economic conditions motivate more companies to raise their prices.

But instead it's syphoned off and it goes to professional scammers who are just stealing from the industry.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nGlastonbury 2024 highlights\n\nSinger breaks UK chart record\n\nBritain's music festival crisis\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nStreaming services have introduced fines and other changes to royalty payment models in a bid to deter fraud. At the start of the year, Spotify introduced a fine for labels and distributors when \"flagrant artificial streaming\" was detected on content they released on the platform.\n\nPhil Kear, assistant secretary general at the Musicians' Union, said that fraud could be addressed by a change to the model used by streaming services.\n\nA \"user-centric\" accounting model would mean that a listener's monthly subscription fee is distributed between the artists they listen to.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:32 'I think it's gross': AI in music industry\n\n\"Currently the 99% of the monthly fee paid by someone who listens exclusively to heavy metal will end up being allocated to Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa tracks and into the pockets of the major labels,\" he said.\n\n\"User-centric would not only mean that the money went to the artists that someone listened to, but would also put an immediate stop to bot streaming: The pirates already need to pay \u00a310 for each account, they currently make money by skewing the distribution so they get more than \u00a310 back, but with user-centric they'd never make more than they spent.\"",

But the 2024 vacation outlook isn\u2019t all sunny: Like the rest of the American consumer experience this year, it is sharply divided.\n\nMany richer consumers \u2014 always the lifeblood of the travel industry \u2014 are feeling good this year as a strong stock market and rising home values boost their wealth. While they have felt the bite of rapid inflation over the last few years, they are likely to have more wiggle room in their budgets and more options to ease the pain by trading down from name brands to generic, or Whole Foods to Walmart.\n\nPoorer families have had less room to maneuver to avoid the brunt of high prices. Although the job market is strong, with low unemployment and wages that have risen especially rapidly at the bottom of the income scale in recent years, some signs of economic strain have been surfacing among lower-income Americans. Credit card delinquencies have risen, many lower earners report feeling less confident in their own household finances, and companies that serve lower-income groups report that they are under stress.\n\nThe gulf between higher- and lower-income consumers has been widening for years, but it is expected to show up especially clearly in travel this summer. Surveys show that richer households are more optimistic about their ability to take trips, and services that they are more likely to use \u2014 like full-service hotels \u2014 are flourishing. Budget hotel chains, by contrast, are expected to report a pullback.",

    "body": "Ex-Post Office chair denies hiding key Horizon report\n\n4 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nPost Office Horizon IT Inquiry\n\nFormer Post Office chair Tim Parker has denied deliberately hiding a key report he commissioned into the Horizon IT system from members of the Post Office board. The 2016 report, written by former top Treasury lawyer Jonathan Swift, raised concerns about the accounting software which was later found to be faulty. Incorrect data from Horizon led to the wrongful conviction of 700 sub-postmasters for theft and fraud between 1999 and 2015. On Wednesday, an inquiry into the scandal heard that only four copies of the Swift report were made, none of which were shared with the Post Office board or the government. Mr Parker said he had been acting on advice from Post Office lawyers not to share the document.\n\n\"It's one of my regrets that I got this advice and I took it,\" he said. \"Could we have shared it? I wish we had, in a way. \"I've had this report commissioned, I wanted to get some kind of result from it, but then I get this advice.\"\n\nAll subpostmaster convictions have now been quashed, but many people went to prison or lost their businesses. The Swift report was commissioned by the government following a BBC Panorama programme in 2015 that raised concerns about the strength of evidence against those convicted. Although supportive of the Post Office in parts, it raised key concerns about whether the Post Office had enough evidence to bring charges of theft. It also cast doubt over claims that Horizon data could not be altered remotely by Fujitsu, the company that developed the software. This turned out to be untrue, and may have deprived subpostmasters of an important line of defence at their trials. Mr Parker, who became chair of the Post Office in October 2015, and remained in the role until September 2022, told the inquiry that top Post Office lawyer Jane MacLeod had advised him not to share the Swift report because it was legally privileged. That meant it had the same confidential status as communications between a lawyer and a client. Mr Parker said he was told that breaching this could have resulted in the report being made public, and that it needed to be kept within the \"tightly knit\" Post Office legal team.\n\n'I had no vested interest in protecting the Post Office'\n\nWhen challenged by inquiry lead counsel Jason Beer, Mr Parker conceded that by doing this he had prevented the board from discussing the report's findings. However, he said he believed that the Post Office legal team would \"take forward\" the report's recommendations and denied hiding it for improper motives. \"What possible motive would I have had at the time from hiding this report from my fellow board members, other than receiving advice that I shouldn't share it?\" he said. \"Bear in mind I had no axe to grind on this, I had no vested interest in trying to protect the Post Office.\" He continued: \"With hindsight of course, it would appear there were motives perhaps underpinning some of the advice or direction of this that were not wholly fair or right or in the interests of people who'd be wronged. \"At the time, however, it seemed to me that the people giving me advice... were doing this in good faith and it was the right thing to do.\" In later questioning, lawyer Sam Stein said as chair Mr Parker had been \"part time\" and his decisions had been \"part baked\". Mr Parker initially worked one and a half days per week on his Post Office responsibilities, and later dropped this down to half a day per week. But Mr Parker rejected Mr Stein's characterisation, saying: \"I don\u2019t accept that. I gave sufficient time and attention to the Post Office. I\u2019m sorry.\"",

    "title": "Water firms could be sued over sewage after ruling",
    "body": "Water firms could be sued over sewage after ruling\n\n4 days ago By Lora Jones , BBC Business Share\n\nGetty\n\nWater companies could face a \"flood\" of legal challenges over sewage discharges, lawyers have said, after a landmark Supreme Court ruling. On Tuesday, seven justices at the UK's highest court ruled that the Manchester Ship Canal Company is able to sue United Utilities over the alleged release of raw sewage into the canal. Speaking to the BBC, one lawyer said owners of adjacent waterways or even members of the public could bring claims against other utility companies as a result. Environmental charities said the ruling was good news. It comes at a time when water companies have been under significant financial pressure and scrutiny for unauthorised discharges of waste. The panel of judges found that the Manchester Ship Canal Company was entitled to bring a nuisance or trespass claim for compensation over the release of \"untreated foul water\". It comes despite previous rulings to the contrary in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal, which led to the private company's appeal.\n\nGetty Images Sewage is discharged from overflow points across England\n\nThere are about 100 United Utilities outfalls along the canal, where treated waste is released from the sewerage network. Raw sewage is also dumped when the system is operating over capacity, something the judges said could be avoided if the firm \"invested in improved infrastructure and treatment\". A lengthy legal battle took place between the canal company, owned by the Peel Group, and United Utilities. The water provider argued that only regulators could take action over the spills, with the original 1991 act that privatised the sector providing it with protection. But Paul Greatholder, partner at law firm Russell Cooke, said that the ruling on Tuesday meant the \"floodgates are open\". \"This could bring a range of potential claims from either the owners of adjacent waterways, or even from members of the public who have been made unwell as a consequence,\" he said. Emily Nicholson, partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya said: \"If millions of copycat claims then spring up, that will be a reflection of the utility companies' failures rather than the failure of the courts or legal system.\" She said that those affected by any failures, such as swimmers, fishermen and environmental organisations, now at least have a route to seek redress. Mr Greatholder also suggested that the Supreme Court had put down a \"marker\" for water utility companies in claiming that issues could have been avoided if more investment had gone into improving the canal's infrastructure. \"No doubt the same could be said of all water companies. Thames Water has spent billions of pounds on a \u2018supersewer\u2019 running through London to try to mitigate just this sort of issue,\" he added. Water firms including Thames Water have come under significant scrutiny over their environmental records in recent months. Recent BBC analysis found that every major English water company had reported data suggesting they've discharged raw sewage when the weather is dry - a practice which is potentially illegal. On Tuesday, United Utilities said it \"understood and shared\" concerns about the need to improve, and pointed to a \u00a33bn investment plan aimed at cutting pollution by improving infrastructure.",

    "title": "Would having an AI boss be better than your current human one?",
    "body": "Would having an AI boss be better than your current human one?\n\n3 days ago By MaryLou Costa , Business reporter Share\n\nHannu Rauma Hannu Rauma says that using AI to help him manage has \"added years to my life\"\n\nWith the stress of managing 83 employees taking its toll, Hannu Rauma was feeling discouraged and frustrated. \u201cI was getting too bogged down in all these things that were going wrong amongst the teams, and feeling this disappointment,\u201d says Mr Rauma, who is based in Vancouver, Canada. He is a senior manager at a company called Student Marketing Agency, which employs university students to provide marketing support for small businesses. \u201cWhen I was bringing new clients on board, half of my mind would be saying, \u2018we're going to screw up\u2019, and it would dampen my enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Rauma says that all changed from last November, when the firm began using an autonomous AI manager developed by US-based company Inspira. The AI manager helps the agency\u2019s employees, who work flexible hours remotely, to set their schedules and plan their workloads in advance. It checks their timekeeping, sends them deadline reminders and regular check-in messages, and records the time spent on different clients, so the latter can be billed accurately. The AI also makes suggestions to improve the wording of written text, is available to answer work-related questions, and automatically updates everyone\u2019s work progress in a central portal. Mr Rauma says that the shift towards an AI manager has not only reduced his stress levels, but has enabled his employees to work faster and be more productive. \u201cI'm able to focus on the growth of the company and all the positive things. It's added years to my life, I'm sure,\u201d he says. Mr Rauma adds that his relationships with his employees have also improved drastically. \u201cBefore, it felt a lot like a father-child situation. Now, we're more on an equal footing. Before, it was only about solving problems. But now we\u2019re able to have more light-hearted discussions.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone at Student Marketing Agency is using the AI manager yet. Mr Rauma and 26 of his 83 employees were actually part of a study run by Inspira and academics from Columbia University, Arizona State University, and the University of Wisconsin to compare the performance of the AI manager with its human counterparts. Participants were divided into three groups: one coached by a human manager, another by the AI manager, and the last group by both AI and human manager. The AI manager achieved a 44% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays in advance, and was able to motivate the employees to log in on time 42% of the time. These figures were comparable to the human manager, who achieved scores of 45% and 44% for those two areas. Yet when the AI manager worked in partnership with a human manager, together they achieved a 72% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays, and managed to achieve 46% on-time success. Despite the study being statistically small, and concentrated on a specific type of worker and field, its results point to interesting implications for companies introducing AI tools.\n\nGetty Images Dell is one firm that has cut jobs in the face of the rise of AI\n\nWhile businesses like UPS, Dell and others have announced significant job cuts this year, with the intention of replacing many roles with AI, Prof Paul Thurman, from Columbia University in New York, argues that swapping management roles completely for AI would be a mistake. \u201cThe middle management layer is the most critical layer in any organisation,\u201d says the professor of management. \u201cThey're the layer that, if it starts turning over, you're in for a wild ride. Your people don't see continuity, they don't get mentoring and coaching\u2026 all the human things that human managers are better at than AI and should be focusing on.\u201d AI, Prof Thurman adds, can liberate managers from endless reminding and checking in, to focus on more innovative ways of working. For example, managers can cherry pick project teams based on individual skillsets, oversee the brief, then hand over to their AI to manage minutiae like deadlines. AI can also identify who in the team is falling behind and may need to be managed more closely by a human, and by the same token, hone in on star performers who require extra recognition. But companies should steer away from AI managers becoming a surveillance tool, he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get to a point where you are noting that, not only do people not clock in on time, but they take too much time at lunch, and they're not eating enough salad. You don't want to go that far,\u201d says Prof Thurman. \u201cYou want to find the right way to encourage the right behaviours.\u201d\n\nAI managers can also help people who have become \u201caccidental managers\u201d - people who excel in their roles and end up managing people as a result, despite management not being a natural skill for them, says Tina Rahman, founder of London-based HR consultancy, HR Habitat. \u201cWe did a study which looked at the reasons people leave a job. Almost 100% of the respondents said it was because of bad management. \u201cSome of them said they didn\u2019t like the way they'd been managed, and most of them also said it was because they didn\u2019t know what was expected of them or if they were doing a good job,\u201d says Ms Rahman. \u201cYou'd assume that an AI manager would be built to give those correct instructions, to give complete transparency on the requirements, and the outcomes. People are likely to be more productive when they know what's expected of them.\u201d But an over-reliance on AI management sets the tone that companies only care about output and not people, Ms Rahman warns. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for a business to tell their employees that they\u2019re introducing this brand new AI system that's going to completely manage them, then say, with the same face, that \u2018we care about your experiences in the workplace,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nJames Bore",

    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking at a on Tuesday, gave the doves most of what they wanted to hear. Although he said more evidence was needed to rationalize cutting interest rates, his overall message favored that policy easing is on the near-term horizon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made quite a bit of progress and in bringing inflation back down to our target,\u201d Powell advised at a central banking forum in Portugal. \u201cThe last [inflation] reading and the one before it to a lesser extent, suggest that we are getting back on the disinflationary path. We want to be more confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2% before we start the process of reducing or loosening policy.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cprogress\u201d includes Friday\u2019s news that the reading of Fed\u2019s preferred measure eased in year-over-year terms in May to 2.6% \u2014 its softest pace in more than three years, based on the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index. Reaching the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target, in other words, appears to be on the near-term horizon.\n\nThe policy-sensitive continues to trade in a tight range, ending yesterday\u2019s session (June 2) at 4.75%. But that\u2019s well below the ~5% mark that was briefly reached in April, which suggests that investor sentiment remains moderately confident that the Fed will soon cut its current 5.25%-to-5.50% target rate.\n\nThe Fed funds futures market is pricing in a moderate probability that the central bank will soon begin easing policy, perhaps as early as the Sep. 18 FOMC meeting. The current estimate reflects a roughly 65% probability that the central bank will announce a rate cut in two months.\n\nThe timing of the rate cuts is a key factor, Powell noted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well aware that if we go too soon, that we can undo the good work we\u2019ve done. If we do it too late, we could unnecessarily undermine the recovery and the expansion.\u201d\n\nThe next update on inflation that will test whether disinflationary progress is continuing arrives on July 11, with the release of consumer prices for June.",

    "title": "De-Dollarization: A Far-Fetched Reality?",
    "body": "In recent years, the financial world has increasingly been marked by discussions surrounding \"de-dollarization.\" This term denotes the strategic efforts by various nations to diminish their reliance on the US dollar for international trade and financial transactions. With rising geopolitical tensions and the emergence of alternative economic blocs, understanding the implications and realities of de-dollarization is paramount for professional traders and investors.\n\nThis article explores the rise of de-dollarization, its impacts on currency and commodity markets, and potential future scenarios.\n\n\n\nDrivers of De-dollarization\n\n\n\nAlthough it is not new, de-dollarization has gained momentum due to several geopolitical and economic factors. Historically, the US dollar's dominance started with the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944, which established the dollar as the primary reserve currency of the world, backed by gold. Despite the system collapsing in the early 1970s, the dollar kept its dominance because of the stability and size of the US economy, its geopolitical influence, and the extensive market for US debt.\n\n\n\nOne of the primary motivations behind de-dollarization is the geopolitical leverage that the United States wields through its control of the global financial system. The US has frequently used economic sanctions as a tool of foreign policy, targeting countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. These sanctions are facilitated by the dollar\u2019s dominance in international finance, which forces targeted nations to seek ways to minimize their exposure to the US financial system. The freezing of Russia's foreign exchange reserves, valued at approximately $300 billion, following its invasion of Ukraine further underscores the risks associated with dollar dependence.\n\nEmerging economies and regional powers are exploring ways to strengthen their currencies and financial systems. The BRICS nations, which include Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, have been discussing a new reserve currency to reduce their reliance on the dollar. In July 2023, Bolivia joined Brazil and Argentina in using the Chinese to pay for imports and exports. Additionally, by March 2024, 52.9% of China's international settlements were conducted in renminbi, a significant increase from less than 1% in 2010.\n\nBrazil and Argentina are at the forefront of de-dollarization in Latin America. They are discussing the creation of a common currency for bilateral trade to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Brazil's trade with other BRICS nations increased dramatically, from $48 billion in 2009 to $178 billion in 2022, showing a 370% growth.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, ASEAN countries are making significant strides towards de-dollarization. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Thailand have agreed to develop a cross-border digital payment system to facilitate local currency trade. As of 2024, Indonesian President Joko Widodo has urged using locally issued credit cards to avoid foreign payment systems, furthering efforts to protect against geopolitical disruptions\u200b\u200b. Malaysia is advancing its de-dollarization agenda by proposing the creation of an Asian Monetary Fund. In 2024, Malaysia's central bank is developing mechanisms to enable trade with China using the Malaysian ringgit instead of the US dollar.\n\nSeveral African nations, including Egypt, Ethiopia, and South Africa, actively engage in de-dollarization through their involvement with the BRICS bloc. The BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) is issuing loans in local currencies to help member nations avoid the risks associated with dollar-denominated financing. As of 2024, the BRICS countries collectively account for around 24% of the global GDP and 16% of global trade. The NDB aims to provide 30% of its loans in local currencies, promoting economic stability among developing nations\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nAnother example of a gradual shift towards regional currencies in bilateral trade is the recent agreement between India and the United Arab Emirates to use the Indian rupee for non-oil commodity trading, moving away from the dollar. the shift.\n\nDe-dollarization is spreading across the globe as more nations adopt local currencies for international trade, diminishing the US dollar's hegemony. Driven by geopolitical maneuvers and economic strategies to reduce dollar dependency, this shift is reshaping international finance. Despite these shifts, however, there are doubts whether these trends will have a decisive impact on dollar dominance. Let's examine how this move towards de-dollarization impacts the USD's role in the global economy.\n\n\n\nCurrent State of Dedollarization\n\n\n\nAs of 2024, the de-dollarization trend is progressively evident in various global economic patterns, though the US dollar retains a robust position in the international financial system. Despite a diversifying landscape, the dollar still accounts for about 69% of global currency usage and approximately 60% of disclosed foreign currency reserves worldwide\u200b\u200b.\n\n\n\nWorld - Allocated Reserves by Currency for 2023Q4, Source: IMF\n\nDe-dollarization profoundly affects the global economic landscape, significantly impacting currency and commodity markets. For instance, the share of the US dollar in global foreign exchange reserves has decreased to a historic low of 58%, a notable drop from 61% in 2022. This trend is driven by central banks diversifying their reserves into other currencies and assets, like the euro, which has increased its share to 21%. Furthermore, gold reserves have grown substantially, with central banks purchasing more gold in 2023 than in any previous year since records began in 1950, making up around 4.9% of China's foreign reserves.\n\nRegarding currency transactions, the US dollar continues to dominate, accounting for 88% of daily transactions. However, the Chinese renminbi's (RMB) share has been growing steadily, reaching 7% of global currency transactions in early 2024, up from less than 1% a decade ago. This increase is supported by China's efforts to internationalize the RMB by establishing global clearing centers and numerous currency swap agreements. Additionally, countries are increasingly conducting bilateral trade in their local currencies to reduce dependence on the US dollar. For example, Brazil and Argentina now trade with China using the RMB, and as of March 2024, 52.9% of China's international settlements were conducted in RMB, surpassing the dollar for the first time. Russia has also significantly increased its use of the yuan for oil and other commodity transactions, with 65% of its trade with China now settled in yuan.\n\nDe-dollarization is influencing financial markets and investment strategies globally. A shift away from the dollar poses risks to US financial assets. Analysts from Morgan Stanley warn that de-dollarization could lead to a depreciation of US stocks, which the dollar's strength and liquidity have supported. A weaker dollar could increase import prices and inflation, potentially undermining investor confidence. On the other hand, de-dollarization could alleviate the burden of dollar-denominated debt for emerging markets. Countries like Turkey and Argentina, which have faced economic crises due partly to their dollar liabilities, could benefit from reduced dollar dependence.\n\nThe impacts of de-dollarization are also evident in commodity markets, particularly in the trading of oil and gold! Oil\n\nThe petrodollar system, initiated in 1974, effectively ended in June 2024. This system was a pivotal economic arrangement that mandated the sale of oil in US dollars, thus entrenching the dollar as the dominant global reserve currency. For decades, this setup facilitated a substantial demand for the dollar because countries had to convert their local currencies into dollars to buy oil, the world\u2019s most traded commodity.\n\nThe agreement's termination means that oil-exporting countries are no longer obligated to conduct their transactions in US dollars. Saudi Arabia, for example, has shifted to pricing and selling its oil in Saudi riyals. This move will cascade global oil trade dynamics, influencing other nations' currency reserves and trading practices. India and China, two of the largest oil importers, need to hold higher reserves of Saudi riyals to maintain their energy supplies.\n\nThis shift could significantly reduce the global demand for the US dollar in oil transactions, which previously accounted for an estimated $1.7 trillion annually or about 20% of all US dollar-denominated trade worldwide. Gold\n\nAmidst a notable de-dollarization trend, central banks globally are increasingly purchasing gold to diversify away from the US dollar, driven by geopolitical tensions and the desire to mitigate financial risks. In 2022, central banks acquired a record 1,136 metric tons of gold, and in the first half of 2023 alone, they added 387 metric tons to their reserves, with China leading these purchases as part of its strategy to minimize reliance on the dollar\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. This movement towards gold is also bolstered by concerns over potential asset freezes, prompting 41% of surveyed central banks and sovereign funds to anticipate increasing their gold holdings in the coming years\u200b\u200b. Analysts predict that gold prices could range from $3,000 per troy ounce by the end of 2024, reflecting ongoing economic uncertainties and sustained demand from central banks\u200b\u200b.\n\n\n\nIs De-dollarization a Reality?\n\n\n\nThe debate over de-dollarization often oscillates between viewing it as an imminent reality or dismissing it as a persistent myth. Based on the latest data and expert analysis as of June 2024, here are several potential scenarios and possibilities regarding the future of de-dollarization.\n\n\n\nScenario 1: Gradual Decline of Dollar Dominance\n\n\n\nThe most likely scenario is a gradual decline in the US dollar's dominance rather than a sudden collapse.\n\n\u25cf Steady Diversification : Central banks worldwide continue diversifying their reserves away from the US dollar. The dollar's share of global reserves has fallen from 59% in 2021 to 58% in 2023. This decline indicates a steady shift towards other currencies, such as the euro, which now holds 21% of reserves, and the yuan.\n\n\u25cf Increased Use of Other Currencies : The renminbi's role in global finance gradually increases. China's international settlements in RMB have surpassed those in USD for the first time, with 52.9% of transactions settled in RMB as of March 2024, compared to 42.8% in USD. Additionally, bilateral trade agreements bypassing the dollar are becoming more common, such as the agreements between Brazil and China.\n\n\n\nScenario 2: Sudden Geopolitical Shifts\n\n\n\nA more dramatic scenario involves sudden geopolitical events that could accelerate de-dollarization.\n\n\u25cf Geopolitical Tensions : Significant geopolitical events, such as escalated tensions between the US and major global players like China and Russia, could hasten de-dollarization efforts. For instance, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has increased the use of non-dollar currencies for Russian trade, particularly with China. Over the past year, most of China's oil imports from Russia have been denominated in yuan.\n\n\u25cf Sanctions and Economic Policies : The US use of financial sanctions has driven some countries to seek alternatives to the dollar to mitigate the risk of economic isolation. Russia's move to eliminate the US dollar from its National Wealth Fund is a case in point, reducing its vulnerability to Western sanctions.\n\n\n\nScenario 3: Technological Transformation\n\n\n\nTechnological advancements, particularly the rise of digital currencies, could significantly impact the pace and extent of de-dollarization.\n\n\u25cf Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) : Developing and adopting CBDCs could provide viable alternatives to the dollar for international transactions. China\u2019s digital yuan is a leading example, already being used in cross-border transactions and potentially reducing reliance on the dollar. By June 2024, nearly 100 CBDCs were globally in research or development stages, with some already used for cross-border transactions\n\n\u25cf Blockchain and Fintech Innovations : Implementing technologies like blockchain could facilitate more efficient and secure international trade without needing a dominant reserve currency. The BRICS Pay initiative aims to streamline transactions among BRICS countries using blockchain, an example of such innovation. Developed in 2018, this platform will enhance real-time transactions between member countries.\n\n\n\nIs De-dollarization a Myth?\n\n\n\nDespite the trends towards de-dollarization, many experts believe the US dollar will retain its dominant position for the foreseeable future. The dollar's enduring trust and liquidity are key factors in this. It remains the most trusted and liquid currency worldwide, accounting for approximately 69% of global currency usage, with the euro at 23%. It is also the preferred currency for international debt issuance and cross-border loans, making up about 60% of disclosed foreign currency reserves.\n\nThe dollar's entrenched global trade and finance position provides a robust foundation. For example, 88% of all over-the-counter foreign exchange transactions involve the US dollar. Despite a gradual decline, the dollar's share in global export invoicing remains high.\n\nAlternatives like the euro and the renminbi face significant challenges. Despite its growth, the renminbi accounts for only 2.3% of global payments via SWIFT and 7% of global currency transactions. Other potential contenders lack the geopolitical and economic stability required for a currency to be a dominant reserve.\n\nSome analysts and economists believe cryptocurrencies could replace the dollar as an international payment, which is also unlikely. will never replace the US dollar because of its high volatility, lack of centralized control, and limited integration into the global financial system.\n\nIn the Weekly timeframe, USDollar, after a strong fall in a long-term uptrend, formed an ascending triangle pattern, which is usually a classic bullish pattern. Bulls Power and MA200 indicate bullish sentiment in the market, so we can expect the to rise further on the rise above the resistance area.\n\n\n\n\u25cf USDollar buying can be considered on a break above the resistance at 106.500, with a target of 109.000, corresponding to 61.8 Fibonacci.\n\nExpert opinions reinforce the dollar's staying power. Analysts from institutions like the IMF and JP Morgan emphasize that while de-dollarization is a trend to watch, the complete displacement of the dollar is unlikely. They highlight the resilience of the dollar's dominance in global finance, particularly given its pivotal role in international transactions and reserves.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nDespite the rising discourse on de-dollarization, the idea that the US dollar will lose its global dominance appears improbable. While countries like China and Russia actively pursue strategies to reduce their reliance on the dollar, the global financial system's entrenched dependence on the greenback remains robust.\n\nThe dollar's supremacy is underpinned by the extensive size and stability of the US economy, its influential geopolitical position, and the deep liquidity of its financial markets. These factors create a resilient foundation for the dollar, making a sudden shift towards alternative currencies highly unlikely.",
    "summary": "Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Thailand have agreed to develop a cross-border digital payment system to facilitate local currency trade.\nAs of 2024, the BRICS countries collectively account for around 24% of the global GDP and 16% of global trade.\nDe-dollarization is spreading across the globe as more nations adopt local currencies for international trade, diminishing the US dollar's hegemony.\nThe debate over de-dollarization often oscillates between viewing it as an imminent reality or dismissing it as a persistent myth.\nDespite its growth, the renminbi accounts for only 2.3% of global payments via SWIFT and 7% of global currency transactions.",

    "title": "Boeing Stock Forecast: About to Take Off or Major Crash Ahead?",
    "body": "Boeing (NYSE: ) has dominated the business pages lately, mainly concerning the safety of its 737 planes and the resulting whistleblower allegations.\n\nThe aircraft manufacturer made headlines again on Monday after announcing that it had agreed a $4.7bn deal to buy parts supplier Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: ). The news was warmly received by the market, with the stock retreating just slightly.\n\nHowever, partly thanks to the recent and ongoing scandals, Boeing stock is still down almost 30% YTD.\n\nSeveral experts have predicted a major crash for Boeing stock, but there are hints of a turnaround for the aerospace giant.\n\nSpirit acquisition \u2013 The ticket to delivery growth?\n\nBoeing has faced quality control issues in the past, resulting in delivery delays. For instance, Boeing\u2019s 737 Max was grounded for almost two years following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nAdditionally, in January 2024, the FAA stopped the production of the 737 Max after an Alaska Airlines flight suffered a mid-air blowout of its cargo door earlier this year.\n\nHowever, Boeing still has ambitions of growing its delivery numbers, with the Spirit acquisition highly likely to bolster this effort. This would significantly boost Boeing Commercial Airplanes\u2019 (BCA) margins as the company clears its multi-year backlog.\n\nMoreoverer, since the acquisition is an all-stock deal, Boeing can avoid using its precious cash reserves.\n\nFollowing the news, investment banking firm Jefferies reiterated its buy rating on the stock with a price target of $270, representing a 45% upside to the current price. The analysis also noted that the deal might dilute Boeing\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) for 2026, but that the benefits from the deal will be \u201cpriceless\u201d.\n\nDeutsche Bank also maintained a buy rating on the stock with a $225 price target. The bank noted that an equity-financed deal is better than a cash offer and that an equity offering would help move the share price up due to reduced liquidity risk.\n\nDisciplined cash flow management\n\nBoeing has also reported positive free cash flow over the past 12 months. Though the company has not paid dividends or repurchased its common stock for some time, it did repay over $5 billion in debt during FY23. This is indeed a sign of disciplined cash flow management.\n\nIn Q1, Boeing\u2019s top and bottom lines were above Wall Street estimates. Still, revenue for the company was down mainly due to a decline in total commercial airplane deliveries. The company will be hoping to overcome this issue with the acquisition of Spirit.\n\nWe will get a better idea of the company\u2019s plans when it reports its Q2 numbers towards the end of July.\n\nPromising stock performance\n\nEven though Boeing stock is down significantly from $215 in early January 2021 to about $185 now, it has still outperformed the S&P 500 in the last two years.\n\nBoeing stock returned -6% in 2021, -5% in 2022, and 37% in 2023. The S&P 500 returned 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24%, suggesting Boeing underperformed the S&P in 2021 alone.\n\nIt is tricky to judge whether the stock will outperform S&P in 2024 considering the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, with high oil prices and interest rates on top of Boeing\u2019s own 737 MAX issues. Still, several analysts believe the stock has ample room for growth.\n\nIs Boeing stock a buy?\n\nThere is no denying that Boeing needs to address a few key issues in the short term \u2013 growing delivery backlog, potential charges from the Department of Justice related to the 2018 and 2019 crashes of the 737 Max aircraft, and the search for a new CEO \u2013 before it can pull off a turnaround.\n\nHowever, Boeing is moving in the right direction, and while it would be fair to say that the firm faces near-term headwinds, its long-term growth prospects look promising.\n\nBased on this, we think Boeing stock would be a sensible buy right now.\n\nOriginal Post",

    "title": "Nvidia: Can Chipmaker Reclaim Market-Cap Throne Amid Antitrust Scrutiny?",
    "body": "Nvidia briefly held the world's most valuable company title but lost ground to tech giants like Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe chipmaker faces antitrust investigations in Europe and potential fines for its dominant market share.\n\nDespite challenges, analysts remain bullish, citing Nvidia's strong financials and future potential.\n\nUnlock AI-powered Stock Picks for Under $8/Month: Summer Sale Starts Now!\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: ) meteoric rise in 2024 wasn't without its bumps. After a brief dip in April, the chipmaker surged to become the world's most valuable company by market cap on June 18th.\n\nHowever, its reign was short-lived. Since then, Nvidia has stumbled, falling behind tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) in terms of market capitalization.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nCEO Jensen Huang's company now faces the challenge of regaining its lost ground. Can Nvidia recapture the market cap crown once again?\n\nNvidia Faces Antitrust Heat in Europe\n\nFrance has thrown a wrench into Nvidia's plans with antitrust investigations, mirroring the challenges faced by tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Meta (NASDAQ: ).\n\nThe European authorities are concerned about Nvidia's dominant position in the graphics processing card (GPU) market, where they hold an 84% market share against competitors like Intel (NASDAQ: ) and AMD (NASDAQ: ). Here's the catch: Nvidia's GPUs are currently the go-to option for running generative AI systems, a technology with massive future potential.\n\nThis situation presents a double-edged sword. While Nvidia offers the best product for customers, it raises red flags for regulators. A violation of European antitrust rules could result in a hefty fine - up to 10% of annual global turnover. Considering Nvidia's 2023 revenue, that translates to a potential $6 billion penalty.\n\nNumbers Back Nvidia's Meteoric Rise\n\nNvidia's exceptional numbers highlight its status as an undisputed leader in today\u2019s most crucial industry. The company recorded $60.9 billion in revenues in 2023, marking a 125.9% year-on-year increase, and posted profits of $44.3 billion. This remarkable growth underscores Nvidia's strategic positioning and market dominance.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise contrasts sharply with the tech boom that propelled Cisco (NASDAQ: ) to the top in 2000, a period that ultimately led to the dot-com bubble burst. Unlike the hype-driven surge that saw Cisco lose 80% of its value, Nvidia's ascent is rooted in tangible results and industry innovation. Initially known primarily to gaming enthusiasts, Nvidia has gained widespread recognition through its solid performance and financial success, not just its brand name.\n\nAnalysts Bet on Nvidia\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Nvidia's future. Morgan Stanley recently raised its target price for the stock from $116 to $144 per share, reflecting a 17.4% increase from its July 2 closing price of $122.67. This \"overweight\" rating from Morgan Stanley is echoed by many market experts, who see Nvidia's shares as a strong buy.\n\nNvidia's sustained growth and robust financial health continue to attract investor confidence, reinforcing its position as a key player in the tech sector.\n\nSource Investing.com: data as of July 3, 2024\n\nOn average, analysts surveyed by InvestingPro set Nvidia's target price at $132.34 per share, up 7.88% from the July 2 price. As many as 51 experts assign the stock a Buy rating, for 4 it is Hold, while none recommend selling the stock.\n\nNvidia: Fairly Valued, But Can It Maintain the Meteoric Rise?\n\nInvestingPro's Fair Value analysis, based on 13 investment models, suggests Nvidia's current price might already reflect its intrinsic value. The model predicts a potential 6.6% decline. However, this indicator frequently updates with new data, and the current reading could be a sign that the company's strong fundamentals justify its massive $3 trillion market cap.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nIn simpler terms, Nvidia isn't necessarily overvalued based on Fair Value analysis. But after such a rapid ascent, it's natural to see consolidation periods where the stock regroups before its next leg up.\n\nAdding to the positive outlook, all indicators point towards Nvidia's excellent financial health. The company boasts a Piotroski score of 9, the highest possible rating for financial strength.\n\nThe Biggest Challenge: Living Up to Its Success\n\nPerhaps the biggest uncertainty surrounding Nvidia is its explosive growth. According to Chris Metcalfe, chief investment officer of IBOSS Asset Management, Nvidia has been responsible for a staggering 30% of the 's returns this year. In essence, Nvidia's biggest hurdle might not be French regulators, but rather exceeding the incredibly high expectations it has set for itself through its phenomenal performance.\n\n***\n\nThis summer, get exclusive discounts on our subscriptions, including annual plans for less than $8 a month!\n\nTired of watching the big players rake in profits while you're left on the sidelines?\n\nInvestingPro's revolutionary AI tool, ProPicks, puts the power of Wall Street's secret weapon - AI-powered stock selection - at YOUR fingertips!\n\nDon't miss this limited-time offer.\n\nSubscribe to InvestingPro today and take your investing game to the next level!\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This article is written for informational purposes only; it does not constitute a solicitation, offer, advice, counsel or recommendation to invest as such it is not intended to incentivize the purchase of assets in any way.

    "body": "Tesla's Q2 2024 production report surpassed expectations, sending its share price soaring\n\nDespite this, the automaker's deliveries are still down 4% year-on-year\n\nWith this mixed picture, we examine whether Tesla stock is a buy right now\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: ) stock surged some 9% higher on Tuesday as news of better-than-expected production and deliveries halted its recent downward trend.\n\nThe news, stemming from the release of Tesla\u2019s much-anticipated production and deliveries report for the second quarter, sent the automaker\u2019s stock up over $230 per share in Tuesday trading.\n\nTesla is still down 7.8% year-to-date (YTD) and 12.5% over the last 12 months (as of July 2), but Tuesday\u2019s performance provided investors with a welcomed boost.\n\nBut can it keep its momentum going? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nBeating Delivery Estimates\n\nAnalysts\u2019 consensus was that Tesla would deliver 436,000 cars in the second quarter, but the actual numbers came in about 2% higher, with roughly 444,000 deliveries. \u2018Deliveries\u2019 equate to cars sold, so this bodes well for Tesla\u2019s second quarter earnings, which are scheduled for release on July 23.\n\nTesla delivered 422,405 of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, which are its most affordable brands. Meanwhile, its other models saw 21,551 deliveries. Overall, the combined total for deliveries was 443,956 in Q2.\n\nWhile this was a surprise, the figure is around 4% lower than Q2 2023. However, it is up substantially from Q1, when the EV maker had just 386,810 deliveries, its lowest number since the second quarter of 2022.\n\nTesla also made more vehicles than expected in the last quarter, producing 410,831 cars. That includes 386,576 Model 3 and Model Ys, and 24,255 for other models.\n\nIs Tesla Stock a Buy?\n\nTesla\u2019s production and deliveries report is certainly good news, but is it enough to warrant a buy? The numbers were still 4% below the same quarter a year ago, and that includes price cuts, low-interest financing, and other incentives to spur flagging sales.\n\nTesla is also seeing increased competition and is losing some market share in an industry that is growing, but at a slower pace.\n\nAnother issue is the CEO, Elon Musk, who is a polarizing figure, mostly for his activities outside of Tesla.\n\nA recent poll by market intelligence firm Caliber, as reported by Reuters, said Tesla\u2019s consideration score, which measures consumer interest in a brand, dropped to 31% after Q1, down from 70% in November of 2021.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that Musk himself is contributing to the reputational downfall,\u201d Caliber CEO Shahar Silbershatz told Reuters earlier this year.\n\nThe other problem is Tesla\u2019s valuation is still high, with a P/E ratio of 54 and a forward P/E ratio of 85.\n\nThere are too many concerns around Tesla stock, not to mention its inflated price. But keep an eye on the next earnings report for more information on its trajectory.",

    "title": "3 Biotech Stocks That Could Gain Exponentially By Leveraging AI",
    "body": "Although fraught with risk, these biotech exposures bring enormous upside potential.\n\nIf there is any sector that could benefit from machine learning, it\u2019s the biotechnology sector. Life sciences are inherently multidisciplinary, generating vast amounts of complex data. AI tools can hone in on emergent patterns in that data, filtering it for insights that open avenues for new advances.\n\nThis could range from sequencing genomes to identify mutations to processing the entirety of a patient\u2019s clinical data to paint a clearer picture. Breaking down this data, too, reveals new patterns in the aggregate of thousands of patients.\n\nUltimately, the breakdown of such large biochemical datasets could lead to both disease predictions and new drug discoveries. Moreover, such AI tools don\u2019t have to carry the imposed burden of \u201cAI safety\u201d due to particular ideological constraints as demonstrated during Google\u2019s Gemini launch debacle.\n\nBut which AI-powered biotech firms have shown the most progress in leveraging AI?\n\n1. Skye Bioscience\n\nWhen pushing the medical envelope, this Californian biotech firm picked the unexplored endocannabinoid system (ECS) field. Naturally produced by the body, endocannabinoids act as neurotransmitters, relaying regulating signals across the body\u2019s cells.\n\nSkye Bioscience (NASDAQ: ) uses CB1-targeting molecules to modulate ECS to improve health. So far, the company has focused on the CB1 inhibitor nimacimab to treat obesity, fibrotic liver, pulmonary, and kidney disease, to name a few.\n\nJust for obesity alone, the addressable market is huge, up to $100 billion by 2030, as forecasted by Goldman Sachs. Moreover, there are indications that CB1 inhibition approach is of lower-risk profile than with current GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic or Trulicity. Based on this promise, Skye Bioscience is pushing nimacimab into Phase 2 trials by mid-summer 2024.\n\nAccordingly, SKYE stock has skyrocketed by 202% year-to-date. At the present price of $8, SKYE shares are nearly half their 52-week high of $15.60 while near the 52-week bottom of $7 per share, suggesting a favorable entry point. \u2019s forecasting places the average SKYE price target at $21 per share.\n\n2. AbCellera Biologics\n\nCanadian Abcellera Biologics (NASDAQ: ) developed a unique platform that combines big data automation to filter development candidates for investigational new drugs (INDs). Specifically, it aims to identify new antibodies via its proprietary monoclonal antibody (mAb) screening platform powered by machine vision and sequencing.\n\nHowever, the company is yet to establish clinical manufacturing capability, set for 2025. In other words, AbCellera is a pre-early-clinical stage company riding on speculation. Nonetheless, other biotech firms have shown confidence in AbCellera\u2019s pipeline model, such as Incyte (NASDAQ: ), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ), Prelude Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ) and Biogen (NASDAQ: ).\n\nIn 2017, AbCellera partnered with Pfizer (NYSE: ) for a multi-target research collaboration. These show AbCellera as a well-networked biotech company but for long-term investing exposure.\n\nYear-to-date, ABCL stock is down 54%. From the 52-week average price of $4.88, ABCL shares are down to $2.78, significantly under the 52-week high of $8 per share. Yet, Nasdaq\u2019s forecasting data points to an average price target of $12.6, making ABCL stock a potential massive wealth-maker.\n\n3. Janux Therapeutics\n\nTackling cancer, a manifestation of cell entropy, remains the holy grail of medicine. Janux\u2019s approach departs from the traditionally toxic T-cell engagers (TCEs) and favors the TRACTrs and TRACIrs pipeline.\n\nThese proprietary platforms promise increased blood serum stability and targeting accuracy to avoid toxic effects on non-tumor areas. AI can boost the development of bispecific molecules to bind to tumor antigens and T cells.\n\nJanux (NASDAQ: ) JANX007 and JANX008 are both in Phase 1 trials, targeting prostate cancer cells and solid tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Of the big pharma players, Janux established cooperation with Merck in 2020, ending March 2024 with a debt-free $652 million pile of cash.\n\nThis potent combo of financials and propelled JANX stock 264% year-to-date. At $41, JANX stock is still below the 52-week high of $65.60. The latter price level is aligned with Nasdaq\u2019s average JANX price target of $63.33 per share.\n\n***\n\nNeither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice.

    "body": "Tesla (NASDAQ: ) surges on surprising delivery numbers while Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) faces potential antitrust hurdles in France. Meanwhile, First Solar (NASDAQ: ) sees a price target adjustment from analysts.\n\nThree tech giants are making headlines in a volatile market for different reasons. Tesla\u2019s stock surged on better-than-expected delivery numbers, while Nvidia faces potential antitrust charges in France. Meanwhile, First Solar sees a price target adjustment from analysts. Here\u2019s a closer look at the latest developments for these closely watched stocks.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Reports Better than Expected Q2 Delivery Numbers\n\nTesla\u2019s stock is on a tear, surging 8.93% to $228.59 as of 12:21 PM EDT on Tuesday. The electric vehicle maker delivered a positive surprise with its second-quarter delivery numbers, reporting 443,956 vehicles delivered, beating Wall Street estimates of 438,000. This marks Tesla\u2019s first delivery beat in four quarters, despite a 4.7% year-over-year decline.\n\n\n\nThe Model 3 and Model Y accounted for the bulk of deliveries at 422,405 units. Despite the recent rally, Tesla\u2019s stock remains down 8% year-to-date, with a market capitalization of $729.051 billion. Analysts are hailing this as a \u201chuge comeback\u201d for the EV giant, with the stock rising for the sixth consecutive trading day.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Reportedly to Face Antitrust Charges\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock is facing headwinds, down 1.69% to $122.20 as of 12:22 PM EDT. The chip maker is reportedly set to face antitrust charges from French regulators for allegedly anti-competitive practices.\n\n\n\nThis would mark the first enforcer to act against Nvidia, following dawn raids in the graphics cards sector last September. The investigation is part of a broader inquiry into cloud computing, with concerns raised about the sector\u2019s dependence on Nvidia\u2019s CUDA chip programming software.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, Nvidia\u2019s stock has shown remarkable performance year-to-date, up 146.85% with a staggering market cap of $3.007 trillion. Analysts even discuss the potential for a $10 trillion valuation, highlighting the company\u2019s dominant position in the .\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Stock Dips After Analyst Lower Price Target\n\nFirst Solar\u2019s stock is experiencing a pullback, down 3.53% to $214.85 as of 12:21 PM EDT. This comes as Robert W. Baird lowered its price target for the company from $344.00 to $307.00 while maintaining an \u201coutperform\u201d rating.\n\n\n\nDespite the reduction, the new target still suggests a 37.85% upside from the previous close. First Solar reported strong first-quarter earnings of $2.20 per share, beating estimates, with revenue up 44.8% year-over-year to $794.10 million. The company\u2019s consensus rating remains a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d with an average price target of $266.04.\n\n\n\nWith a market cap of $22.971 billion and a PE ratio of 23.34, First Solar continues to be a significant player in the solar energy sector. Despite today\u2019s dip, its year-to-date return is 24.56%.\n\n***\n\nNeither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice.

    "body": "Pope Francis 'alert' after respiratory failure\n\n3 March 2025 Share Save Sarah Rainsford BBC News Reporting from Rome Jacqueline Howard BBC News Reporting from London Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nPope Francis is alert after suffering two episodes of \"acute respiratory failure\" on Monday afternoon, the Vatican has said. Doctors were forced to intervene to clear mucus from the Pope's lungs, an update from the Holy See said, though it said he was alert throughout. The 88-year-old pontiff has resumed the use of an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing, but remains \"alert, focused and cooperative\", the Vatican said. This is now the third serious downturn since the 88-year-old pontiff was admitted to hospital 18 days ago with pneumonia.\n\nOn Friday, Pope Francis suffered an \"isolated\" breathing crisis involving vomiting, the Vatican said. Updates from the Holy See reported that he responded well to oxygen therapy, with Vatican officials saying on Sunday the Pope no longer required \"non-invasive mechanical ventilation, only high-flow oxygen therapy\". Following Monday's episodes, Pope Francis has resumed that mechanical ventilation. His illness has meant that Pope Francis has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person for three weeks in a row, with the Vatican publishing his written comments instead. Officials said the text, sent from his hospital room in Rome, had been written \"in the past few days\". In it, the Pope thanked people for their prayers and thanked his medical team for their care. He will also miss the procession and mass this Wednesday that mark the first day of Lent, the six-week period leading to Easter. Hundreds of Catholics gathered outside in St Peter's Square on Monday for an eighth evening to pray for the Pope's health, many carrying rosary beads as they headed across the cobbles towards the Basilica.\n\nThe crowd, a mixture of priests and nuns based in Rome and Catholic pilgrims here for a Jubilee year, were led by an American cardinal. \"I come every night to pray, but this night I am pretty worried,\" Javier, a Romanian priest, voiced the feelings of many on the square. \"We still have hope, but it doesn't look good.\" \"It looks bad, and that's a shame because we really like Francis,\" Patricia, a Spanish catholic from Toledo, told the BBC. She was following the prayers with her husband and young daughter. \"He's really opened the doors of the church to many, like LGBT people. I think they will look for a more conservative pope next, to stop the change.\" Catholics have also been visiting the Gemelli hospital in Rome to pray for him - hoping he might come to the window, as has happened in the past. But although the Vatican recently described the Pope's condition as stable, he remains too sick even to greet the crowd below.\n\nReuters",

    "body": "Utah becomes first US state to ban fluoride in its water\n\nUtah's move to remove the mineral has been criticised by experts, who worry it will have consequences for oral health, especially for children.\n\nFluoride has been added to US drinking water since 1945 to prevent cavities.\n\nGovernor Spencer Cox signed the ban into law this week, which will go into effect on 7 May. Other states, including Florida and Ohio, are weighing similar legislation.\n\nUtah has become the first US state to ban the use of fluoride in its public water, following concerns raised by health secretary Robert F Kennedy that the mineral poses potential health risks.\n\nThe bill, signed by Cox on Thursday, prohibits communities from adding fluoride to their public water supplies.\n\nThe law does not mention any public health concerns related to the mineral, but Republican state lawmaker Stephanie Gricius - who introduced the bill in the state legislature - has argued that there is research suggesting fluoride could have possible cognitive effects in children.\n\nGricius has said that her bill would give citizens a choice whether they want to consume fluoride or not.\n\nThis concern over fluoride was previously raised by Kennedy, the US health secretary, who said in November that \"the Trump White House will advise all US water systems to remove fluoride from public water\".\n\nHe alleged the chemical found in toothpaste and regularly used by dentists \"is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease\".\n\nMost public health experts have rejected these claims and alleged that Kennedy had cited data from studies conducted in countries with far higher levels of fluoride in their water systems than the US has.\n\nThe American Dental Association sharply criticised Utah for its decision, saying that it shows \"wanton disregard for the oral health and well-being of their constituents\".\n\n\"It is disheartening to see that a proven, public health policy, which exists for the greater good of an entire community's oral health, has been dismantled based on distorted pseudoscience,\" the association's president, Denver dentist Brett Kessler, said in a statement.\n\nMany public health groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have long supported adding small amounts of fluoride to drinking water.\n\nThe US Public Health Service reduced the amount of fluoride it recommended adding to water in 2015, but the federal government has encouraged states since the 1960s to add small amounts of the chemical to water to help prevent cavities and aid oral health.\n\nRecent court rulings have led to the reduction of fluoride in US water, and some experts have questioned the continued need for it in water systems given its wide availability in toothpaste and other dental products.\n\nMost of western Europe does not add fluoride to its water. In England, about one in 10 people has fluoridated drinking water, though a programme has since been introduced to fluoridate water for 1.6 million people in north-east England.\n\nBy contrast, around 63% of the US population have fluoridated water.\n\nExperts who support putting fluoride in water says studies show that community water fluoridation prevents at least 25% of tooth decay in children and adults.\n\n\"The scientific weight of sound evidence around the benefit of community water fluoridation is clear and compelling,\" the American Dental Association said in October of last year.\n\nProf Avijit Banerjee, chair of cariology and operative dentistry at King's College London, previously told the BBC that \"the potential harmful effects of fluoride cited have not been associated with the very low levels of fluoride used in water fluoridation programmes\".",

    "body": "JD Vance's ominous pitch to Greenland\n\n29 March 2025 Share Save Andrew Harding Reporting from Nuuk, Greenland Share Save\n\nReuters A cultural tour of Greenland by JD Vance's wife Usha has been cancelled\n\nA green shimmer, like a curtain of light being drawn across the night sky, formed beside the impossibly bright stars above Nuuk late on Friday evening. The appearance of the spectacular northern lights \u2013 a common wonder in these parts \u2013 seemed to mark the end of a hugely significant day in the arctic, one that brought icebound Greenland's hopes and challenges into the sharpest relief. It was a day in which an acquisitive foreign power had sent an uninvited delegation to the world's largest island with an uncomfortable message. On a brief visit to a remote US military base in the far north of Greenland, US Vice-President JD Vance may have tried at times to soften his boss's stated aim of simply annexing the autonomous Danish territory. \"We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary,\" Vance said, perhaps attempting to sound reassuring. But the vice-president's overarching message remained stark and intimidating: the world, the climate, and the Arctic region are changing fast, and Greenland needs to wake up to threats posed by an expansionist China; long-standing Western security partnerships have run their course; the only way the island can protect itself, its values and its mineral wealth is by abandoning weak and miserly Danish overlords and turning instead to the muscular and protective embrace of the US.\n\n\"We need to wake up from a failed, 40-year consensus that said that we could ignore the encroachment of powerful countries as they expand their ambitions,\" Vance told US troops at America's Pituffik military base. \"We can't just bury our head in the sand - or, in Greenland, bury our head in the snow - and pretend that the Chinese are not interested in this very large landmass.\" If you look at a map of the world that has the north pole at its centre, rather than the equator, it is easy to see how Greenland suddenly switches from being an easily overlooked smudge of uninhabited territory and into a key strategic landmass. It is at the heart of what many analysts now accept as an emerging power struggle between China, the US, and Russia, for control of the arctic, its minerals and its shipping lanes. But the speed and contempt with which the Trump White House has rejected its traditional reliance on Western allies \u2013 Nato in particular \u2013 has left its partners bewildered. \"Not justifiable,\" was the bristling response of Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen after hearing Vance attack her government as he stood on its sovereign territory.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'Like a threat'\n\nBut 1,500km (930 miles) south of the Pituffik base, in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, the American story vied for attention with a very different local event on Friday. \"We will prevail,\" a smiling crowd sang, at a ceremony to celebrate the formation of a new coalition government for Greenland. The mood felt mostly joyful and communal, with people locking arms and swaying gently as a band played inside the town's house of culture. It was a powerful reminder of the shared values that bind Greenland's tiny, and overwhelmingly native Inuit population together - the need for consensus and co-operation in an often hostile natural climate, the desire to protect and celebrate Inuit culture and the wish to be respected by outsiders, be they from familiar but distant Denmark or marginally closer America. \"There are many ways to say things. But I think the way [Trump] is saying it is not the way. It's like a threat,\" said Lisbeth Karline Poulsen, 43, a local artist attending the ceremony. Her reaction appeared to capture the broader mood here - a recent poll showed just 6% of the population support the idea of being part of the US.\n\nThe journey to independence\n\nUnder its new government, and with overwhelming public support, Greenland is beginning a slow, very cautious move towards full independence from Denmark. It's a process that will likely take many years, and which will involve lengthy dialogue with both Copenhagen and Washington. After all, Greenlanders well understand that their economy needs to be far more developed if their bid for independence is to stand any realistic chance of success. But they need to balance that development against realistic fears of exploitation by powerful outside commercial forces. Which brings us to the fundamental confusion, in Greenland and beyond, about the Trump administration's approach towards their territory.\n\nWhat does America want?",

    "title": "At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up",
    "body": "At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up\n\n18 March 2025 Share Save Brian Wheeler Political reporter Share Save\n\nPA Media\n\nThe government has announced plans for major changes to the benefits system aimed at cutting the growing amount the UK spends on welfare.\n\nStricter tests for personal independence payments (Pips)\n\nPip is paid to people in England and Wales who have difficulty completing everyday tasks or getting around as a result of a long-term physical or mental health condition. It is not means tested and is available to people who are working. The payments will go up in line with inflation this year. But the eligibility criteria will be tightened up from November 2026, potentially resulting in reduced payments for many. It will become harder to qualify for the daily living component of Pip, which starts at \u00a372.65 a week. There will be no change to the mobility component. There will also be a review of the Pip assessment process.\n\nBut those with most severe conditions will not face reassessments\n\nThe government wants more frequent reassessments for many people claiming Pip, with more face-to-face assessments. But those with the most severe, long-term conditions will no longer face any reassessments, under the proposed reforms.\n\nWork capability assessment to be scrapped\n\nThe work capability assessment that determines who is eligible for incapacity benefits will be scrapped in 2028, under the proposals. Instead, people applying for health-related financial support and disability benefits will only face one assessment, based on the current Pip system.\n\nIncapacity benefits under universal credit to be halved for new claimants\n\nIncapacity benefits under universal credit will be frozen in cash terms for existing claimants at \u00a397 per week from April next year - this means they will not be increased in line with inflation until 2029/30. The amount will be reduced to \u00a350 per week in 2026/2027 for new claimants. But those receiving the new reduced universal credit health element after April 2026, who have the most severe, life-long health conditions, who have no prospect of improvement and will never be able to work, will see their incomes protected through an additional premium. It also means those in that group will not be reassessed in the future. There will also be an above inflation increase in the standard rate of universal credit for all those seeking work, adding up to \u00a3775 a year extra by 2029/30. The government says this will help tackle the \"perverse incentives\" in the system that keep people on benefits.\n\nReduced incapacity benefits for under 22s\n\nThose aged under 22 will no longer be able to claim the incapacity benefit top-up to universal credit under these proposals. The government says any savings generated from the delay would be reinvested into work support and training opportunities for this age group. Ministers are also consulting on raising the age at which young people move from Disability Living Allowance for children to Pip from 16 to 18. The idea is that young people will have work and training \"rather than a pathway to economic inactivity\", the DWP says.\n\nMore incentives to work\n\nThe government says it wants to ease people's fears about losing benefits if they take a job and it doesn't work out. Ministers say they will introduce legislation \"as soon as possible\" to guarantee that trying work will not lead to an automatic Pip or work capability reassessment. It's hoped a newly-designed \"support conversation\" will give people who have a health condition or disability help to access work. Consultations will start on the Access to Work scheme, looking at improvements to help people stay in the workplace, with adjustments like aids or assistive tech. Overall, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced a \u00a31bn package of support to help disabled people and those with long-term conditions into work.\n\nDifferences in Scotland and Northern Ireland\n\nMost of the measures apply to the whole of Great Britain. Pip applies to England and Wales only. If there is a cut in the budget for Pip, a proportionate figure will be cut from the amount the Treasury gives to the Scottish government. So Scottish ministers would have the choice of applying a similar scale of cuts, or of finding funds from other spending, or tax, to fill that gap. The benefits system is devolved in Northern Ireland but in practice the Stormont administration mostly copies what is happening in England and Wales. If NI ministers choose not to apply the cuts they would have to fund that by making savings on other parts of their budget or raising more revenue.",

    "body": "Will companies leave China to side-step tariffs when selling to the US?\n\nLaura Bicker\n\nChina correspondent, in Beijing\n\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, Employees at a Chinese-funded textile and garment factory in Kampong Chhnang Province, Cambodia (picture taken November last year)\n\nGrant in Miami asks: With some companies already pulling out of China and moving to countries such as Vietnam, is Trump just stubborn, or ignorant to the fact that tariffs can not force economic growth within the US?\n\nA number of both foreign and Chinese firms have been moving production outside the country in the last decade \u2013 even before Donald Trump became the president in 2016 and started imposing tariffs.\n\nShoe manufacturers, for instance, wanted to avoid higher labour costs in China and moved to Vietnam. But the drift to south-east Asia and beyond accelerated after the Trump administration started imposing tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018.\n\nIn Cambodia, around 90% of clothing factories are now Chinese-run or Chinese-owned, according to a report by insight and analysis group Research and Markets.\n\nI saw this for myself in Phnom Penh. The garment firms still source most of their materials in China \u2013 so you are right, Grant: Trump\u2019s tariffs have not stopped Chinese firms from setting up shop elsewhere.\n\nRemember - Trump is angry because China sells four times more than it buys from the US.\n\nBack in 2020, after a two-year bitter tit-for-tat trade war, the two sides agreed to a \"Phase One\" trade deal where China pledged to buy an extra $200 billion dollars of US goods. His administration argued that this deal would put money back into the US economy.\n\nUnfortunately, not long after that it was agreed, the pandemic struck, relations between Washington and Beijing soured and the deal fell apart.\n\nBut this is the kind of deal Trump likely hopes to do once again. Will his tactics work?\n\nChina has pledged to fight to the bitter end of any trade war. It will also feel in a better position that during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nBeijing has spent the last five years making new economic partners \u2013 especially throughout the Global South.

    "body": "'We don't need a Gail's' - the coffee shop boom dividing locals\n\n9 March 2025 Share Save Lucy Hooker BBC Business reporter Reporting from Macclesfield Share Save\n\nBBC Jane Kent says Macclesfield doesn't need any more places to buy pastries\n\nThere is a cheerful red awning and a newly painted cream wooden shopfront on the market square in Macclesfield. A new bakery cafe has just opened, offering ciabatta and sourdough loaves as well as hot cross buns, syrupy cakes, vegetable quiches and of course coffee. Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival. But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too. A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people \"hate\" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries. Its arrival isn't universally popular here either. \"We don't need another coffee shop,\" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. \"There are too many,\" says Nicola.\n\nNicola Tomlinson and Linda Willdig do not think Macclesfield needs another coffee shop\n\nIn fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Greggs is just around the corner too. So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse. \"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\" At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business. But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming. \"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\" She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour. At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".\n\nStephanie Lamb says she is happy to have something new in town\n\nGail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by. It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May. At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.\n\nKaterina Antos-Lewis Gail's opened in Macclesfield on Friday on a corner site location\n\nEven in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average. So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago. Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks. Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.\n\nMacclesfield has independent butchers, one of the things Gail's looks out for when it is picking a new location\n\nWith enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood. Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key. He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones. \"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists. But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes. It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market. \"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says. If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.\n\nFirefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison says Gail's is just a \"posh Greggs\"\n\nBut retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents. \"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion. \"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents. \"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.\n\nKaren Pearson wants the town to \"stay like it is\"\n\nIn Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer. \"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\". They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents. But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.\n\nLocal independents like Flour, Water, Salt say they aren't worried\n\nIndependents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England. Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands, he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",

    "title": "Pakistan moves closer to Bangladesh as India watches warily",
    "body": "India watches warily as Bangladesh-Pakistan ties thaw\n\n17 March 2025 Share Save Anbarasan Ethirajan South Asia Regional Editor Share Save\n\nGetty Images Bangladesh imported 50,000 tonnes of rice from Pakistan in February\n\nThe dramatic political developments in Bangladesh that led to prime minister Sheikh Hasina being ousted last year have thrown up many surprises - including Dhaka's growing closeness with one-time foe Pakistan. Last month, after decades of troubled relations, the two countries began directly trading for the first time, with Dhaka importing 50,000 tonnes of rice from Pakistan. Direct flights and military contacts have also been revived, visa procedures have been simplified, and there are reports of co-operation on security matters. The countries - separated by the landmass of India - have deep, painful historical ties. The animosity between them goes back to 1971, when Bangladesh - then known as East Pakistan - launched a struggle to gain independence from Islamabad. India supported the Bengali rebels during the nine-month war which led to the formation of Bangladesh. While the scars from that period run deep, Dhaka had cordial relations with Islamabad between 2001 and 2006, when a coalition of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami governed the country. This changed during Hasina's 15-year rule from 2009 - when she was strongly backed by Delhi and maintained a distance from Pakistan. But after she fled to India following mass protests against her government, ties seem to be thawing. \"For the past 15 years, the Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship was on a slightly difficult trajectory,\" says Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, adding that the relationship seems to now be returning to that of \"two normal neighbours\". The developments are being watched closely, particularly in India, which has a long history of hostile relations with Pakistan.\n\nX/Shehbaz Sharif The leaders of Pakistan and Bangladesh have expressed a desire to boost ties\n\nRelations between Dhaka and Delhi have been frosty since Hasina's exit. India has not reacted to Bangladesh's demands to extradite her to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her. Some experts think the reviving of relations between Dhaka and Islamabad is a strategic move. \"Pakistan and Bangladesh have a tactical relationship at the moment. Together, they want to represent a pushback against the dominance of India,\" says Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at King's College in London. There have been other developments apart from starting direct trade. Muhammad Yunus, head of the interim Bangladesh government, met Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at multilateral forums several times in recent months. And then there is a growing military relationship. A high-level Bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to Pakistan in January and held talks with influential army chief General Asim Munir. The Bangladeshi navy also participated in a multinational maritime exercise organised by Pakistan off the Karachi coast in February. . Veena Sikri, who was India's high commissioner to Bangladesh between 2003 and 2006, describes the growing closeness between Dhaka and Islamabad as a \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" moment. During her tenure in Dhaka, she said, India repeatedly raised the issue of \"Indian insurgents getting trained inside Bangladesh with the support of the ISI [Pakistan's intelligence agency] and a section of the Bangladeshi military\". \"We even provided evidence to Bangladeshi authorities,\" she said. Authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh denied these allegations at the time. The long, porous border between India and Bangladesh makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India's north-eastern states to cross over from Bangladesh. But, after Hasina's Awami League came to power in 2009, it cracked down on these groups and dismantled their bases. So the revival of military ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan is \"a major security concern for India\", says Ms Sikri. \"It's not just the military relationship. The Pakistani establishment is also reviving ties with Bangladeshi Islamist parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami, which supported Islamabad during Bangladesh's independence war,\" she adds. The Yunus administration's press office has flatly rejected Indian media reports that senior ISI officials have visited Dhaka. It has also described reports that claim Pakistani operatives were working to reopen a camp of an Indian insurgent group in Bangladesh as \"baseless\". Pakistan's military did not respond to BBC questions on India's concerns over the future role of the ISI in Bangladesh. Analysts say Bangladeshi politicians are aware that, given the close economic and linguistic ties, Dhaka cannot afford to take an anti-India stance. And despite apprehensions in Delhi, Bangladeshi diplomats argue that ties with Pakistan cannot be normalised unless issues related to the 1971 war are resolved.\n\nGetty Images Bangladesh, backed by the Indian army, gained independence from Pakistan in 1971 after months of war\n\nDuring the war, hundreds of thousands of Bengalis were killed and tens of thousands of women were raped. The war ended with more than 90,000 Pakistani security and civilian personnel surrendering to the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces in what is seen as a humiliating chapter in Islamabad. Bangladesh has demanded a formal apology from Pakistan for the atrocities committed during the war but Islamabad has shown no inclination to do so. \"Pakistan needs to own the crimes that had taken place during the independence war,\" said Mr Kabir, the former Bangladeshi diplomat. \"We had also raised the issue of the division of pre-1971 assets between the two nations in several bilateral meetings with Pakistan.\" Even former Pakistani military officers like Ikram Sehgal accept that \"the main stumbling block in bilateral ties is the requirement of the Bangladeshis that Pakistanis should apologise for what happened in 1971\". However, the retired Pakistan army major insists that Bangladesh should also address the issue of attacks by Bengalis on Urdu speakers during the struggle for independence. \"I was a witness to the atrocities that took place against the Urdu-speaking Bihari people [in East Pakistan],\" Mr Sehgal, who now lives in Karachi, told the BBC.\n\nGetty Images Last year, hundreds were killed in the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971\n\nWhile history casts a shadow over ties between Dhaka and Islamabad, economists point out the two countries can first focus on improving bilateral trade, which currently stands at less than $700m (\u00a3540m), mostly in favour of Pakistan. \"Pakistan's more than 250 million population is a solid market for Bangladesh in the medium to long term,\" says Sabrin Beg, an associate professor of economics at the University of Delaware. Currently, there are constraints including high tariffs on both sides and businesses and exporters face visa and travel obstacles, she points out. However, Ms Beg says \"improved bilateral political and trade relations will ease these constraints\". Some of these issues may be discussed during Pakistani foreign minister Ishaq Dar's visit to Dhaka in April. By the end of the year Bangladesh is expected to hold general elections and a new government may have a different set of foreign policy priorities. But, whatever happens, the stakes are high for Delhi, which strongly feels that a stable and friendly Bangladesh is necessary to maintain peace and stability in its north-eastern states.",

maintained a distance from pakistan but after she fled to india following mass protests against her government ties seem to be thawing for the past 15 years the pakistanbangladesh relationship was on a slightly difficult trajectory says humayun kabir a former senior bangladeshi diplomat adding that the relationship seems to now be returning to that of two normal neighbours the developments are being watched closely particularly in india which has a long history of hostile relations with pakistan xshehbaz sharif the leaders of pakistan and bangladesh have expressed a desire to boost ties relations between dhaka and delhi have been frosty since hasinas exit india has not reacted to bangladeshs demands to extradite her to face charges of crimes against humanity money laundering and corruption hasina denies the accusations against her some experts think the reviving of relations between dhaka and islamabad is a strategic move pakistan and bangladesh have a tactical relationship at the moment together they want to represent a pushback against the dominance of india says ayesha siddiqa a pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at kings college in london there have been other developments apart from starting direct trade muhammad yunus head of the interim bangladesh government met pakistans prime minister shehbaz sharif at multilateral forums several times in recent months and then there is a growing military relationship a highlevel bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to pakistan in january and held talks with influential army chief general asim munir the bangladeshi navy also participated in a multinational maritime exercise organised by pakistan off the karachi coast in february veena sikri who was indias high commissioner to bangladesh between 2003 and 2006 describes the growing closeness between dhaka and islamabad as a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moment during her tenure in dhaka she said india repeatedly raised the issue of indian insurgents getting trained inside bangladesh with the support of the isi pakistans intelligence agency and a section of the bangladeshi military we even provided evidence to bangladeshi authorities she said authorities in pakistan and bangladesh denied these allegations at the time the long porous border between india and bangladesh makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from indias northeastern states to cross over from bangladesh but after hasinas awami league came to power in 2009 it cracked down on these groups and dismantled their bases so the revival of military ties between bangladesh and pakistan is a major security concern for india says ms sikri its not just the military relationship the pakistani establishment is also reviving ties with bangladeshi islamist parties like the jamaateislami which supported islamabad during bangladeshs independence war she adds the yunus administrations press office has flatly rejected indian media reports that senior isi officials have visited dhaka it has also described reports that claim pakistani operatives were working to reopen a camp of an indian insurgent group in bangladesh as baseless pakistans military did not respond to bbc questions on indias concerns over the future role of the isi in bangladesh analysts say bangladeshi politicians are aware that given the close economic and linguistic ties dhaka cannot afford to take an antiindia stance and despite apprehensions in delhi bangladeshi diplomats argue that ties with pakistan cannot be normalised unless issues related to the 1971 war are resolved getty images bangladesh backed by the indian army gained independence from pakistan in 1971 after months of war during the war hundreds of thousands of bengalis were killed and tens of thousands of women were raped the war ended with more than 90000 pakistani security and civilian personnel surrendering to the joint command of indian and bangladeshi forces in what is seen as a humiliating chapter in islamabad bangladesh has demanded a formal apology from pakistan for the atrocities committed during the war but islamabad has shown no inclination to do so pakistan needs to own the crimes that had taken place during the independence war said mr kabir the former bangladeshi diplomat we had also raised the issue of the division of pre1971 assets between the two nations in several bilateral meetings with pakistan even former pakistani military officers like ikram sehgal accept that the main stumbling block in bilateral ties is the requirement of the bangladeshis that pakistanis should apologise for what happened in 1971 however the retired pakistan army major insists that bangladesh should also address the issue of attacks by bengalis on urdu speakers during the struggle for independence i was a witness to the atrocities that took place against the urduspeaking bihari people in east pakistan mr sehgal who now lives in karachi told the bbc getty images last year hundreds were killed in the worst violence bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971 while history casts a shadow over ties between dhaka and islamabad economists point out the two countries can first focus on improving bilateral trade which currently stands at less than 700m \u00a3540m mostly in favour of pakistan pakistans more than 250 million population is a solid market for bangladesh in the medium to long term says sabrin beg an associate professor of economics at the university of delaware currently there are constraints including high tariffs on both sides and businesses and exporters face visa and travel obstacles she points out however ms beg says improved bilateral political and trade relations will ease these constraints some of these issues may be discussed during pakistani foreign minister ishaq dars visit to dhaka in april by the end of the year bangladesh is expected to hold general elections and a new government may have a different set of foreign policy priorities but whatever happens the stakes are high for delhi which strongly feels that a stable and friendly bangladesh is necessary to maintain peace and stability in its northeastern states",
    "summary": "India supported the Bengali rebels during the nine-month war which led to the formation of Bangladesh.\nThe developments are being watched closely, particularly in India, which has a long history of hostile relations with Pakistan.\nA high-level Bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to Pakistan in January and held talks with influential army chief General Asim Munir.\nThe long, porous border between India and Bangladesh makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India's north-eastern states to cross over from Bangladesh.\nSo the revival of military ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan is \"a major security concern for India\", says Ms Sikri.",

    "body": "TikTok investigated over use of children's data\n\n3 March 2025 Share Save Tom Gerken Technology reporter Share Save\n\nPA Media\n\nThe UK data watchdog has launched what it calls a \"major investigation\" into TikTok's use of children's personal information. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) will inspect the way in which the social media platform uses the data of 13 to 17-year-olds to recommend further content to them. John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, said it would look at whether TikTok's data collection practices could lead to children experiencing harms, such as data being leaked or spending \"more time than is healthy\" on the platform. TikTok told the BBC its recommender systems operated under \"strict and comprehensive measures that protect the privacy and safety of teens\".\n\nIt added that the platform also has \"robust restrictions on the content allowed in teens' feeds\". Mr Edwards said TikTok's algorithm \"feeds\" on personal data gleaned from user profiles, preferences, links clicked and how long they spend watching a particular video - making it subject to UK rules. In addition to the probe into TikTok, the ICO is also checking the age verification processes of Reddit and Imgur, an image-sharing platform. The investigation will look into whether the companies are complying with both the UK's data protection laws, and the children's code. The code is set to design principles for online platforms aimed at protecting children in the UK. Platforms which collect UK children's user data must minimise the amount they gather and take extra care when processing it.\n\nReddit and Imgur probes\n\nThe ICO's investigations into Reddit and Imgur will focus on how the platforms check the ages of their users and their enforcement of age checks. Ofcom said in October Reddit had overtaken X as the UK's fifth most popular platform. Imgur, meanwhile, says on its website that it reaches more than 250 million people a month. However, it does not state in which countries their users are based, so there is no figure for the number of people using it in the UK. \"I don't want to pre-judge how we might look at the Imgur and Reddit matters, but if there are age limits for accessing services, then the platforms have to enforce those in some ways,\" the Information Commissioner told the BBC. \"There are a number of different technologies and techniques that are available, I would say, and the degree of rigor, I think, depends in part upon the kinds of risks, the likelihood that children will be accessing those sites. \"I guess a baseline would be: self-declaration is probably not going to cut it if there is content on the site or services on the site that are unsuitable for children under the age of 13.\" A Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that 95% of their users are adults but that they \"have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance\". Imgur has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment.\n\nNext steps",

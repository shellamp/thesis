    "title": "Some Pennsylvania Jews reminded of Tree of Life shooting after arson attack on Josh Shapiro\u2019s home",
    "body": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 A year ago, Carole Zawatsky was invited by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to a Passover Seder, held in the same room at the governor\u2019s official residence that was devastated by an arsonist just hours after Shapiro hosted this year\u2019s Jewish holiday feast.\n\nNow, as she looks at photos of the destruction, Zawatsky can envision where she had been seated and how deadly the attack could have been.\n\nLike many others, Zawatsky is cautiously awaiting word from investigators about the motivations of the attacker, which are clouded by hints of erratic behavior as well as statements from his past.\n\nStill, the attack hit the Jewish community hard in a state where such pain is achingly familiar. It targeted Pennsylvania\u2019s religiously observant Jewish governor in the very place where just hours before he had hosted one of the central rituals of the Jewish calendar.\n\nZawatsky heads a Pittsburgh organization formed to counter antisemitism and memorialize the victims of another Pennsylvania assault \u2013 the murders of 11 worshippers from three congregations at the Tree of Life synagogue more than six years ago, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.\n\n\u201cSeeing those images is deeply traumatic,\u201d said Zawatsky, CEO of The Tree of Life, the group established in the wake of the Oct. 27, 2018 killings. \u201cIt\u2019s not too much to ask that we all live in a country where we celebrate our faith without fear.\u201d\n\nA murkier picture emerges on motive\n\nThe synagogue shooting trial revealed that the gunman, who was convicted and sentenced to death, had long been steeped in antisemitism and methodically carried out the attack.\n\nIn the Harrisburg case, things are less clear. Investigators have released only fragments of what the suspect, Cody Balmer, of Harrisburg, told them. His relatives say he has struggled with mental illness, and his lawyers suggested Wednesday that will be central to their defense.\n\n\u201cWe have no definitive information about this person\u2019s motive,\u201d Zawatsky said. \u201cWe do know that there was certainly hate involved.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania State Police said the 38-year-old Balmer confessed to the attack, harbored hatred for the governor and said he planned to beat Shapiro with a hammer.\n\n\u201cBALMER identified himself by name and related that Governor Josh SHAPIRO needs to know that he \u2018...will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people,\u2019\u201d police wrote as part of applications for search warrants. Exactly who and what that meant were unclear in the documents.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York on Thursday called on the Justice Department to determine whether the attack qualifies as a federal hate crime.\n\nAudrey Glickman, a survivor of the 2018 attack and a member of Tree of Life Congregation, said she admired Shapiro\u2019s composure, just hours after the attack, and his emphatic denunciation of hatred regardless of motivation.\n\n\u201cIt takes a while to realize you\u2019ve been attacked and what to make of it,\u201d Glickman said. She admired \u201chow he stood up right away and spoke strongly about it.\u201d\n\nShapiro responded to the scene of the 2018 Pittsburgh attack as Pennsylvania\u2019s then-attorney general. As governor, he took part in the 2024 groundbreaking for a new building to replace the synagogue, including a memorial, programming and other exhibits aimed to counter antisemitism.\n\nReminders of an overheated political climate\n\nAbout 200 people participated in a somber march Wednesday night in Harrisburg. They walked from the parking lot of a synagogue to the governor\u2019s residence, where they held a multifaith prayer vigil across the street.\n\nSeveral marchers connected the attack to the overheated political climate.\n\n\u201cTo deny it is like putting your head in the sand,\u201d said retired Presbyterian minister Don Potter, 75, of Dillsburg, who said the images of the building\u2019s interior with fire damage \u201cmade me sick.\u201d\n\nEnid Wassner, a retired child care worker from Hershey, said the fact that the firebombing occurring during Passover and targeted Shapiro and his family was \u201cextremely worrying.\u201d She noted that Jewish institutions and buildings in Harrisburg have had to increase security.\n\n\u201cGradually things have been getting more worrisome, for me personally and the entire Jewish community.\u201d\n\nQuestions emerge about attacker\u2019s mental state\n\nPolice said in court affidavits that in an interview with detectives Balmer \u201cadmitted to harboring hatred towards\u201d Shapiro and referred to the Palestinian people in a 911 call attributed to him that was placed shortly after the break-in.\n\nBalmer\u2019s mother and brother have said he suffered from bipolar disorder and would not consistently take medication. His brother, Dan Balmer, said Cody Balmer twice in recent years spent time in a psychiatric hospital in Harrisburg. During a court hearing on Monday, Balmer denied any history of mental illness.\n\nDan Balmer told the AP on Tuesday that Cody Balmer \u201chad these theories that were going on in his head\u201d and became angry when family members would tell him his views didn\u2019t reflect reality.\n\n\u201cThe allegations, if true, demonstrate the devastating consequences of severe mental illness,\u201d Mary Klatt, the chief public defender in Dauphin County, whose office is representing Balmer, said Wednesday. She said his preliminary hearing would be delayed to determine whether Balmer is mentally competent to stand trial.\n\nIdentity moves to forefront for Shapiro\n\nShapiro declined to talk about the attacker\u2019s motive on Wednesday, saying prosecutors will ultimately determine what drove him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to answer that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor has publicly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government and the nature of Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza, but also has backed Israel\u2019s right to defend itself from Hamas.\n\nHank Butler, executive director of the Pennsylvania Jewish Coalition, said Shapiro\u2019s focus has been Pennsylvania and not the Palestinian people.\n\n\u201cTo say that our governor wishes the worst on the Palestinian people is not welcomed here,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt is not justified, absolutely not justified -- no attack is justified.\u201d\n\nShapiro has won statewide races three times in a crucial battleground state. He was a finalist to be Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate in last year\u2019s presidential campaign and is considered a potential 2028 Democratic candidate for president.\n\nThe attack once again puts his identity front and center. When Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Shapiro, Republicans tried to cast the pick as a snub to Jewish voters.\n\nRabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform congregations in North America, connected the attack to Shapiro\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s also someone who is a strong supporter of Israel,\u201d Jacobs said of Shapiro. \u201cAre those things that put your life at risk in the 21st century?\u201d\n\nZawatsky, the Tree of Life CEO, noted that in the Passover ritual, Jews are instructed not just to recite the story of their ancient forebears\u2019 liberation from slavery but to envision themselves as having experienced it \u2013 something that feels especially poignant now. Whether law enforcement officials ultimately settle on a definitive conclusion about what motivated last weekend\u2019s attack, she and others already know what living in fear feels like.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad to think we pass along the inherited trauma of the fear of antisemitism, but never did I think we would be a generation that would have the lived experience of this kind of violent antisemitism,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

    "title": "Excellent start for baseball\u2019s NL West foreshadows a potentially historic 4-team summer race",
    "body": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Dodgers seem like they have nearly unlimited amounts of money, three former MVPs in their starting lineup with Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, and a pitching staff that never runs out of overpowering arms.\n\nSo far, that\u2019s good for third place in their five-team division.\n\nWelcome to the National League West, which is far from a one-team show four weeks into the season. Going into Friday night\u2019s games, the San Diego Padres (17-8), San Francisco Giants (17-9), Dodgers (16-9) and Arizona Diamondbacks (14-11) are all off to a good start, foreshadowing a potentially fascinating summer race.\n\n\u201cFor us, who are so close to it, not surprised,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cThey\u2019re all very good teams. I think it\u2019s the best division in baseball. We\u2019re all sort of built differently, too, which is interesting and fun if you look at the construction, the strengths, weaknesses of the four clubs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an interesting season how this all plays out.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, the big-spending Dodgers have not underperformed this season. Los Angeles has a .640 winning percentage through 25 games, which translates to a 104-win pace. That\u2019s right where everyone pretty much expected them to be.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s the great play from the Padres and Giants \u2014 and to a lesser extent the D-backs \u2014 that has set up a summer of fun. Since baseball split the NL and AL into three divisions in 1994, the 2002 AL West has the record for the highest winning percentage with a .566 mark.\n\nSo far, the 2025 version of the NL West is off to a .544 start \u2014 and that\u2019s including the Colorado Rockies, who are a dreadful 4-20 for the worst record in baseball. Take out the Rockies, and the other four teams have combined for a .634 winning percentage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a battle the entire season,\u201d Giants third baseman Matt Chapman said. \u201cWe knew the Dodgers are the Dodgers, the Padres are really, really good and so are the Diamondbacks.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers continue to be the undeniable favorites to win the division. Los Angeles is off to a quality start despite Betts\u2019 illness that caused him to drop around 15 pounds, Freeman\u2019s shower mishap and Blake Snell\u2019s arm trouble.\n\nA good first month from Tommy Edman, Will Smith and Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez at the plate have showcased the lineup\u2019s depth. Yoshinobu Yamamoto looks like a potential NL Cy Young award winner with an 0.93 ERA through five starts. Ohtani has slugged six homers with his return to the mound looming.\n\nThe Padres are playing well largely thanks to Fernando Tatis Jr., who is off to a torrid start with a .333 batting average, eight homers and 17 RBIs. Veteran starting pitchers Nick Pivetta and Michael King have led the rotation while closer Robert Suarez hasn\u2019t given up a run this season and leads the NL with 10 saves.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re aware to some degree of what is taking place in the division and in the league, but our energy \u2014 my energy \u2014 is not about what anyone else is doing. It is on what we do,\u201d Padres manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cWe\u2019re spending our time and efforts on taking care of ourselves, because if we don\u2019t do that, nothing else is going to matter.\u201d\n\nThe Giants are arguably the division\u2019s biggest surprise, led by a productive lineup that includes Jung Hoo Lee, Mike Yastrzemski, Wilmer Flores and Chapman. Right-hander Logan Webb has been dominant, with a 1.98 ERA and 44 strikeouts over six starts.\n\nThe D-backs have been a little more inconsistent than their division rivals, but are still lurking. Outfielder Corbin Carroll is off to an MVP-caliber start with a .321 batting average, nine homers, 23 RBIs and five stolen bases.\n\nDiamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo echoed others when he said he\u2019s aware of the division\u2019s excellence, but tries not to dwell on it. The 162-game regular season is hard enough to navigate without worrying about other teams.\n\nBeing in the NL West might prove particularly stressful \u2014 and fun \u2014 this summer.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it makes everyone crazy,\u201d Lovullo said, grinning. \u201cIt makes you guys crazy, you guys make me crazy, I make you crazy. Everyone\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writers Janie McCauley and Jay Cohen, and freelancer Dave Hogg, contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Investigators strongly suspect that a pair of shootings three blocks apart in Minneapolis that left four people dead and two others seriously injured were connected and were gang related, the police chief said Wednesday.\n\nThe first shooting happened late Tuesday and killed three people. The second, which happened around 1 p.m. Wednesday, killed one person. A bullet fired during that shooting just barely missed two young children in a nearby vehicle, police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said.\n\nThe police chief said at a news conference that investigators believe all of the victims were Native Americans and that the shootings had shaken the large Indigenous community in the Phillips neighborhood south of downtown.\n\nHe told reporters that investigators were still trying to establish a link between the shootings, and he declined to speculate on a motive or give details about any suspected gang connections. He said the investigation was still at its early stages. No arrests have been made.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re three blocks away. The community\u2019s saying something\u2019s going on here, \u201dhe said. \u201cWe have to follow the evidence. I cannot speculate. You can make your own assumptions based off the facts.\u201d\n\nThe killings followed a period of relative peace in Minneapolis, which like many cities saw an increase in crime during the COVID-19 pandemic and after the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.\n\nBut crime fell in many major cities last year, and Minneapolis recently went two months without a homicide until a man was shot to death April 19. It was the city\u2019s longest period without a homicide in a decade, according to police. Authorities have credited the work of community organizations and a federal crackdown on local gang members.\n\n\u201cOur entire city is grieving right now,\u201d Mayor Jacob Frey told reporters. \u201cAnd we know that our Native community is feeling that trauma quite acutely.\u201d\n\nIn the late Tuesday shooting, four people were shot in a vehicle and one on a nearby sidewalk, according to police. O\u2019Hara said a 20-year-old woman, a 17-year-old boy and a 27-year-old man were killed. A 28-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman were taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. O\u2019Hara said the man remained in grave condition Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWednesday\u2019s shooting happened outside an apartment building that houses the Minneapolis offices of the Red Lake Nation tribe. A man in his 30s died, O\u2019Hara said.\n\n\u201cWhat is even more disturbing,\u201d he added, was that one round from the shooting went through the rear door of an SUV \u201cand passed just beneath the legs of two children in child seats, an infant and a toddler.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hara reiterated his earlier statements that it was \u201cvery clear\u201d that victims of the first shooting were deliberately targeted and that it was \u201cpotentially gang related.\u201d\n\nThe chief did not say whether the fatal shootings might have been connected with another nearby shooting overnight in which a man was dropped off at a hospital with a non-life-threatening gunshot wound.\n\nO\u2019Hara appealed for anyone with information to come forward.\n\n\u201cWe need everyone to stand up and say this is not OK,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd law enforcement will not rest until everyone involved in both of these incidents is brought into custody.",

    "body": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 A suspect in a shooting at a Dallas high school that wounded four students and drew a heavy police response to the campus has been taken into custody, school district officials announced Tuesday night.\n\nThree of the students were injured by gunfire and the fourth was injured in their lower body, according to the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department. The department said units were dispatched to Wilmer-Hutchins High School just after 1 p.m. and that the four students, all of whom are male, were taken to hospitals with injuries ranging from serious to not life-threatening.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, this is just becoming way too familiar. And it should not be familiar,\u201d Stephanie Elizalde, superintendent of the Dallas Independent School District, said at a news conference.\n\nThe school district said in a statement Tuesday night that a suspect was apprehended within hours of the shooting, but didn\u2019t provide details about the person or say whether they had been arrested.\n\nChristina Smith, assistant police chief for the Dallas Independent School District, said at the earlier news conference that the investigation was fluid and she did not have any information on what led to the shooting.\n\nThe three who were shot were between the ages of 15 and 18, while the age of a person with a \u201cmusculoskeletal injury\u201d was not known, Dallas Fire-Rescue said.\n\nA woman arrives to a checkpoint outside Wilmer-Hutchins High School, where police are responding to reports of a shooting, in Dallas, Tx., Tuesday, April 15, 2025.

    "body": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Dodgers left-hander Blake Snell is going to stop throwing for a couple days after he felt some discomfort when he played catch Tuesday.\n\nSnell is on the 15-day injured list because of shoulder inflammation. The two-time Cy Young Award winner signed a $182 million, five-year contract in November.\n\n\u201cBlake, as he was playing catch, just didn\u2019t feel great,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said before Wednesday night\u2019s 7-6 loss to the Chicago Cubs. \u201cSo right now we\u2019re going to slow play the throwing and probably get it looked at again when we get back home.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old Snell is 1-0 with a 2.00 ERA in two starts this season. It was unclear when the pitcher reported the issue; Roberts said before Tuesday\u2019s 11-10 loss to the Cubs that Snell had played catch and \u201cit went well.\u201d\n\nRoberts said Wednesday that he isn\u2019t concerned at this point.\n\n\u201cPart of the messaging from us to Blake is it\u2019s about later on in the season and if there\u2019s any type of discomfort, let\u2019s not try to fight through it,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd so, given where we\u2019re at right now on the calendar, not concerned at all, and even talking to Blake yesterday, wasn\u2019t concerned.\u201d\n\nAfter signing Roki Sasaki in January, the Dodgers began the season with some pitching depth. But that depth is being tested.\n\nTyler Glasnow left Sunday\u2019s win against the Rangers because of lower leg cramps, but the 31-year-old right-hander is on track to start Sunday at home against Pittsburgh.\n\nThe World Series champions also have some help on the way. Clayton Kershaw pitched three-plus innings of one-run ball in a rehab appearance with Double-A Tulsa on Tuesday. Tony Gonsolin worked five-plus innings of two-run ball in a rehab start for Triple-A Oklahoma City on Wednesday night.\n\nKershaw, 37, is coming back from offseason surgeries on his toe and knee. The three-time Cy Young Award winner struck out four and walked one in his second rehab start.\n\n\u201cIt was good. He came out of it well,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cVelocity was good. Got into the fourth inning. He\u2019ll make a start next week, so really positive stuff.\u201d\n\nRoberts said Kershaw\u2019s toe injury is getting better, but \u201cit\u2019s probably going to be something he\u2019s going to have to deal with, and it\u2019s not going to be pain-free.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers played without catcher Will Smith in their series finale against the Cubs. Smith had some left wrist soreness after making a tag at the plate in the sixth inning of Tuesday night\u2019s game.\n\nRoberts said the team could get some imaging for Smith when it gets back to Los Angeles. The Dodgers are off Thursday before hosting Pittsburgh on Friday night in the opener of a three-game series.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

    "title": "Former All-Star closer Romano getting rocked in 1st season with Phillies",
    "body": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Jordan Romano says his right arm felt the best it had in a long time \u2014 the two-time All-Star closer even hit 99.8 mph on a four-seam fastball.\n\nThe Marlins just hit him \u2014 rocked him, actually \u2014 much, much harder.\n\nThe Phillies\u2019 eight-inning rout turned close in the ninth once Romano was summoned to close out an 11-4 lead. Dane Myers instead hit a three-run homer, Graham Pauley added an RBI double and Liam Hicks added a two-run shot \u2014 his first big-league homer \u2014 and suddenly it was 11-10.\n\nRomano, already in the midst of a rough first season in Philly, was heavily booed Saturday as he trudged off the mound.\n\n\u201cKind of expect that when you\u2019re pitching like that, for sure,\u201d Romano said.\n\nRomano was charged with six runs and retired just two batters in the ninth before Jos\u00e9 Alvarado bailed him out and got the final out of the 11-10 win for his fifth save.\n\nRomano\u2019s ERA ballooned to 15.26 in nine games this season.\n\n\u201cI felt confident, honestly, in all my pitches,\u201d Romano said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, they were seeing it really well today. Everything I threw in there, I felt like they were pretty comfortable with. Obviously, putting pretty good swings on it.\u201d\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, Romano thought he might have solved his mechanical issues when he adjusted the leg lift on his delivery. Romano was left to wonder after he gave up six hits on just 22 pitches if perhaps he\u2019s tipping his pitches. He said he\u2019d watch the video to find out if there\u2019s another flaw in his delivery.\n\n\u201cUsually, I don\u2019t (watch video), when it\u2019s just a blooper or something like that,\u201d Romano said. \u201cBut when they\u2019re putting that good a swings on it, for sure.\u201d\n\nManager Rob Thomson said the Phillies will conduct a deeper dive to determine whether Romano is tipping his pitches.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a great track record,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cAs long as his stuff is good, you\u2019ve got to believe in him.\u201d\n\nAn All-Star in 2022 and 2023, Romano spent the first six seasons of his major league career with the Toronto Blue Jays. He had 105 saves and a 2.90 ERA in 231 relief appearances with Toronto. The Phillies declined to re-sign former All-Star relievers Carlos Est\u00e9vez and Jeff Hoffman and instead made a short-term bet on Romano with an $8.5 million, one-year contract.\n\nHoffman signed with the Blue Jays and entered Saturday 2-0 with a 1.59 ERA, 16 strikeouts in 11 1/3 innings and five saves.\n\nThe 31-year-old Romano was limited to just eight saves in 15 games last season. He had arthroscopic surgery on his elbow in July but has been healthy with the Phillies.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s honestly crazy to me is like, I went out there and executed what I wanted to do,\u201d Romano said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the worst result possible. I wanted to drive the zone with my heater, throw the slider in there for strikes. I did that. Just got crushed.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

    "body": "Shedeur Sanders\u2019 slide down the NFL draft was the dominant story of the weekend with one of college football\u2019s most high-profile players lasting until the fifth round.\n\nThe fact Sanders was taken by the Browns two rounds after they drafted another quarterback in Dillon Gabriel made the entire situation even more rare.\n\nThe Browns were the first team to draft two quarterbacks in the first five rounds of the NFL draft since Washington did it in 2012, when the team traded up to take Robert Griffin III with the second-overall pick and then drafted Kirk Cousins in the fourth round.\n\nThere are only a handful of other times in the common draft era beginning in 1967 that a team picked two quarterbacks that high in the draft.\n\nGreen Bay drafted Anthony Dilweg in the third round and Jeff Graham in the fourth in 1989. The Packers traded Graham to Washington later in the draft and he never played a game in the NFL despite spending time with several teams. Dilweg started seven games in 1990.\n\nThe Colts double-dipped at quarterback in 1982, taking Art Schlichter fourth overall and Mike Pagel in the fourth round. Schlichter played only 13 games because of gambling problems, while Pagel had a long career, mostly as a backup.\n\nThe Houston Oilers also did it in 1971, taking Dan Pastorini in the first round and Lynn Dickey in the third. Both had long careers as starters in the NFL.\n\nThere were two other times it happened but one of those QBs quickly shifted positions to receiver once joining the NFL.\n\nThe Jets took Kellen Clemens in the second round and Brad Smith in the fourth in 2006. Clemens spent 12 seasons in the NFL, mostly as a backup, while Smith had a successful career as a receiver, returner and occasional wildcat quarterback.\n\nThe Raiders took quarterbacks with their first two picks in 1968 but first-rounder Eldrige Dickey moved to receiver following his first training camp and had only five catches in his career. Second-rounder Ken Stabler went on to become the 1974 AP NFL MVP and had a Hall of Fame career as a quarterback.\n\nTrading up\n\nTrading up for a top-two pick in the NFL draft isn\u2019t that uncommon with it happening five times in the last 13 drafts before this season. Doing it for a non-quarterback was rare.\n\nThe deal made by Jacksonville with Cleveland to move up from No. 5 to No. 2 to take Travis Hunter marked the first time since 1997 that a team traded up that high to draft a non-quarterback.\n\nIt happened twice in 1997, with the Raiders trading up to No. 2 that year before the Rams jumped them two weeks later to trade for the No. 1 pick. The Rams took Hall of Famer Orlando Pace and the Raiders drafted Darrell Russell.\n\nThere hadn\u2019t been a receiver taken in the top two since Calvin Johnson went second to Detroit in 2007 and no defensive back had been taken that high since safety Eric Turner went second to Cleveland in 1991.\n\nThere were 12 other instances in the common draft era starting in 1967 when a team traded up for a top-two pick and drafted a non-quarterback.\n\nPace was one of four Hall of Famers acquired that way with the other three all being running backs: Eric Dickerson (1983), Earl Campbell (1978) and Tony Dorsett (1977).\n\nSome of the other trades weren\u2019t as successful, like Cincinnati moving up to take running back Ki-Jana Carter first in 1995, the Jets trading up for receiver Lam Jones in 1980 and the Vikings moving up for running back Clint Jones in 1967.\n\nOhio State and SEC top the draft lists\n\nWith the SEC setting a record with 79 players drafted and Ohio State having 14 of the 71 draft picks in the Big Ten, the two most prominent college football conferences dominated draft weekend.\n\nThanks to the first year of expansion that sent Texas and Oklahoma to the SEC, along with USC, UCLA, Oregon and Washington joining the Big Ten, those conferences accounted for 58% of all draft picks.\n\nThrow in the 42 picks for the ACC and 31 for the Big 12 and the four power conferences had nearly 87% of all draft picks this year, along with six more from Notre Dame.\n\nThe Group of Five had just 18 players drafted as many players who began their careers at that level have moved up to power conferences. There were only eight players chosen from non-FBS teams.\n\nThere were players who finished their college careers at 86 schools that got drafted, with the defending champion Buckeyes leading the way with 14 \u2014 one off of the record since the start of the seven-round draft era in 1994 set by Georgia in 2022.\n\nThe Bulldogs were next with 13, followed Texas with 12, Oregon with 10 and Ole Miss with eight. Five schools had seven players drafted: Alabama, Florida, LSU, Miami and Michigan.\n\nThis marked the 87th straight draft with a player from Michigan being taken. USC also has had a player taken in every draft since 1939, tying the Wolverines for the longest active streak.\n\nPosition breakdown\n\nThere was an even split of offensive and defensive players picked in the draft with 126 players from each side of the ball picked \u2014 not including the two-way player Hunter.\n\nThe other four players taken were specialists, including a rare long snapper drafted with Julian Ashby getting taken by New England with the 252nd pick.\n\nThe defensive line led the way with 58 players taken, according to Sportradar, followed by 47 exclusive defensive backs and 41 offensive linemen.

    "body": "REDMOND, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing and artificial intelligence business helped deliver $70.1 billion in sales and boosted profits by 18% for the January-March quarter, a dose of relief for investors during a turbulent time for the tech sector and U.S. economy.\n\nThe company reported quarterly net income of $25.8 billion, or $3.46 per share, beating Wall Street expectations for earnings of $3.22 a share.\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based software maker posted revenue of $70.1 billion in the period, its third fiscal quarter, up 13% from the same period a year ago and also beating Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Microsoft to post revenue of $68.44 billion for the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella credited cloud growth for its strong quarter. The company\u2019s cloud unit posted revenue of $26.8 billion, compared with expectations of $26.17 billion.\n\n\u201cCloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth,\u201d Nadella said in a statement.\n\nThe company also saw a 6% increase in revenue in its personal computing unit, which includes its laptop business and Xbox services.\n\nNadella noted on a call with investors that demand for cloud and artificial intelligence remained strong. He said Microsoft is constantly tweaking its investments based on efficiency improvements in computing systems and what kind of services customers want.\n\n\u201cWe just want to make sure we are accounting for the latest and greatest information,\u201d he said.\n\nMicrosoft is among a group of the tech industry\u2019s bellwether companies that have been through a period of uncertainty and turmoil since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a see-sawing of stocks that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid an onslaught of tariffs and other actions.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s stock price has dropped nearly 8% since Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, to about $395 at the close of markets Wednesday. But investors appeared pleased moments later after Microsoft released its earnings report, sending stocks up more than 6% in after-hours trading.\n\nRevenue from Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing business segment grew 21%, to $26.8 billion, also beating Wall Street projections.\n\nThe company felt more tariff uncertainty in its personal computing business, which is centered around its Windows operating system and the fees it collects from computer makers that put it on the hardware they sell.

    "title": "\u2018Sinners,\u2019 shot on IMAX film, is a historic first for female cinematographers",
    "body": "Cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw didn\u2019t realize she was going to make history on \u201cSinners.\u201d The Ryan Coogler film, now playing in theaters nationwide, marks the first time a female director of photography has shot a movie on large format IMAX film.\n\nIt was Kodak executive Vanessa Bendetti who texted her the news.\n\n\u201cI smiled at the thought,\u201d Arkapaw said in a recent interview. \u201cI felt very proud that Ryan gave me the opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe format, a favorite of filmmakers like Christopher Nolan, has gained popularity in recent years \u2014 not just with directors but with moviegoers seeking it out as well. Coogler hadn\u2019t originally sought it out for \u201cSinners\u201d (he had planned on using 16 mm) until Warner Bros. executive Jesse Ehrman asked him if he\u2019d considered large format, which gives moviegoers more resolution and a shallower depth of field.\n\n\u201cJust from an exhibition sense in this day and age with folks having so much access to streaming and watching so many things on their phones, it\u2019s nice to have a format like IMAX that can be an experience you can only experience in the theaters,\u201d Coogler told The Associated Press.\n\nCoogler and Arkapaw then began a testing process, looking at 70 mm IMAX prints of films like \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d \u201cThe Hateful Eight\u201d and \u201cTenet\u201d and consulting with Nolan and his regular cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. Coogler quickly fell in love with the format and felt it was fitting for the larger-than-life, genre-bending film about vampires, the blues and life in the Jim Crow south in 1932.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised that we were exploring large format,\u201d Arkapaw said. \u201cWe shot \u2018Wakanda Forever\u2019 on IMAX, but that was digital. We always talked about true IMAX being ... something that you see and you fall in love with.\u201d\n\nHer conversation with Hoytema made her even more excited. The Oscar-winning \u201cOppenheimer\u201d cinematographer told her not to worry about the size or weight of the equipment and to shoot the movie as she would with any other kind of camera.\n\n\u201cHearing that straight off was inspiring and encouraging and we took that advice and just told our story,\u201d Arkapaw said. \u201cIt was very freeing.\u201d\n\nIn the end, they decided to employ a combination of IMAX film and Ultra Panavision 70, an even rarer format that Quentin Tarantino resurrected for \u201cThe Hateful Eight.\u201d This means different scenes have different aspect ratios, which Coogler himself broke down in a video explainer for Kodak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using these two formats for the very first time,\u201d Coogler said. \u201cIt really complements the story, it really complements the setting and it really complements the filmmaking.\u201d\n\nOne of Arkapaw\u2019s favorite scenes was one they weren\u2019t even initially going to do on IMAX film because it was dialogue heavy and the cameras are notoriously noisy. But if her work on \u201cWakanda\u201d taught her anything about Coogler, it\u2019s that he\u2019s always looking to push boundaries.\n\nThe scene is the introduction to Jack O\u2019Connell\u2019s Irish vampire Remmick and the Choctaw trying to hunt him down, which they shot like a Western as the sun sets in the distance.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of beautiful crane work in that and some intimate stuff. Ryan loves a hallway, so there\u2019s a Steadicam shot inside. It\u2019s very eerie,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t see that scene in any other format now.\u201d\n\nWith \u201cSinners\u201d out now, the hope is that audiences will seek out the special formats where they can, whether it\u2019s IMAX film or digital.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring people back to the cinema, get back to theaters,\u201d \u201cSinners\u201d star Michael B. Jordan said. \u201cI think this is a movie that\u2019s meant to give for the moviegoing experience\u2026it takes you on a ride.\u201d\n\nThe profession has come a long way since Arkapaw started exploring cinematography as a career path. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that she said she struggled to find many women cinematographers besides Ellen Kuras (\u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d). And while there are more than there were 20 years ago, there are still barriers to be broken, including an Oscar win. Only three have been nominated: Rachel Morrison (who worked with Coogler on \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d) was the first for \u201cMudbound,\u201d in 2018, followed by Ari Wegner for \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d and Mandy Walker for \u201cElvis.\u201d\n\nArkapaw takes the significance of her landmark seriously.\n\n\u201cI heard a phrase that said you need to see you to be you,\u201d she said. \u201cI think for us females in business, the more women are able to shoot on large format, it will inspire the younger girls who maybe don\u2019t think that they can get there.\u201d",

    "title": "The Sharks look to a brighter future after 2nd straight season with the NHL\u2019s worst record",
    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The end result wasn\u2019t much different for the San Jose Sharks with a second straight season finishing at the bottom of the NHL standings.\n\nThe way they got there with promising play from a young core led by talented rookies Macklin Celebrini and Will Smith and far more competitive play on the ice offers hope that one of the four franchises to miss the playoffs each of the last six seasons is not far off from getting back to playoff contention.\n\n\u201cIt was a step forward,\u201d general manager Mike Grier said Friday. \u201cIt was disappointing to still finish the season where we did. It\u2019s still a wins and loss league at the end of the day. To some degree you are what your record says you are. That\u2019s the kind of frustrating, disappointing piece of it all because I think the group played better. Definitely more competitive and everything. But there\u2019s still a long ways to go.\u201d\n\nThe Sharks finished the season 20-50-12 for a league-low 52 points \u2014 five more than last season \u2014 as they became the first team in 10 years to lose at least 50 games in regulation in back-to-back seasons.\n\nThe team improved its goal differential by 44 goals from the previous season but still finished last in the NHL in both goals scored and goals allowed.\n\n\u201cIt was a season of frustration,\u201d first-year coach Ryan Warsofsky said. \u201cI think there\u2019s some growth individually and as a group. But obviously we have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nGrier said the priority this offseason will be improving defensively, with the hope that the team can be better at protecting leads.\n\nThe Sharks lost 10 times in regulation this season after holding a lead in the third period \u2014 no other team in the league had more than four \u2014 and had five more losses in overtime or shootouts after leading in the third.\n\nTheir eight regulation losses this season when leading at the end of the second period were the most for any team in eight years and tied for the most in the NHL in any season since at least 1970-71.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fine line between winning and losing in this league,\u201d Warsofsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s usually one play here or there or two plays, a save here or there and that\u2019s the game. We saw that this year. Our players saw that this year. We\u2019ll see that in the playoffs this year. ... I\u2019m glad we went through those. At the time, it was tough. But hopefully everything happens for a reason and we can learn from those.\u201d\n\nWarsofsky attributes some of those issues to the youth of the team, which is also the biggest selling point for improvement next season.\n\nCelebrini, the first pick of last year\u2019s draft, had a sensational season as an 18-year-old, leading all rookies with 25 goals, ranking second with 63 points and playing as a top-line center often against the opponent\u2019s best players.\n\nCelebrini talked about wanting to cut down on his turnovers and Warsofsky said knowing when to take chances will come with more experience.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say enough great things about this kid,\u201d Warsofsky said. \u201cThe way he works, the way he competes to how driven he is, his natural leadership ability. He\u2019s a winner through and through. He\u2019s going to help this organization win hockey games very, very soon and he already has. There\u2019s some things that every player needs to work on. Mac really drags guys into the fight, the way he competes.

    "body": "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Former NBA player Stan Love, the brother of Beach Boys singer Mike Love and the father of Miami Heat player Kevin Love, has died. He was 76.\n\nKevin Love announced his father\u2019s death in an Instagram post Sunday night. No cause was given, but he referenced longstanding health issues in the post.\n\n\u201cDad, you fought for a long time,\u201d Kevin posted. \u201cThe hardest stretch being these past 6 months. The most painful to witness being these last few weeks. And even at the end as you continued to deteriorate \u2014 I still saw you as a Giant. My Protector. My first Hero.\u201d\n\nHe went on to write, \u201cDad, I\u2019m so proud to be your son. My only hope is that you\u2019re proud of me. It was all I ever wanted. Thank you for everything.\u201d\n\nStan Love was a 6-foot-9 forward who starred at Morningside High School in Inglewood, California, and at Oregon before he was selected ninth overall by Baltimore in the 1971 NBA draft.\n\nHe averaged 6.8 points and 4.0 rebounds in 226 games in four seasons with the Bullets and the Los Angeles Lakers. He also played 12 games for San Antonio in the American Basketball Association.\n\nMike Love posted, \u201cMy big younger brother, you called me the superstar, but to me you are the superstar!! You always had my back! I am blessed to be your brother. I will cherish our lives spent together, whether spoofing on each other or reliving memories. I know you\u2019re on the big court now, pounding down 3\u2019s; don\u2019t foul out, bro.\u201d\n\nStan Love introduced Kevin to basketball after the family moved from California to Oregon in the 1980s. He often attended UCLA games along with Mike Love when Kevin starred for the Bruins as a freshman in 2007-08.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d always tell me stories about Wes Unseld, Connie Hawkins, Jerry West,\u201d the younger Love told The Associated Press in 2008. \u201cI wanted to be the greatest basketball player of all time, like every little kid wanted to be.\u201d\n\nThe elder Love focused his hard-nosed development efforts on Kevin, his middle child and second son. Some days, Kevin would be outside in the rain at their Lake Oswego, Oregon, home shooting jumper after jumper.\n\n\u201cMy hands would be all dirty, I\u2019d come in and make the floor all muddy,\u201d Love told AP. \u201cOnce he saw I was a self-starter, then he kind of backed off.\u201d\n\nBesides Kevin, the elder Love is survived by wife Karen, son Collin and daughter Emily.\n\nKevin Love has been away from Heat because of personal reasons and will not play in Game 4 against Cleveland on Monday night.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",

    "body": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Cade Cunningham had exactly what he wanted.\n\nWith seven seconds left and his Detroit Pistons trailing the New York Knicks 94-93 in Game 4, Cunningham was looking at a wide-open 15-footer from the middle of the floor.\n\n\u201cI got a shot I loved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a shot that feels like muscle memory for me.\u201d\n\nIf he hit it, the Pistons were going back to New York with the series tied at 2 and Jalen Brunson likely dealing with a sore right leg.\n\nInstead, Cunningham missed and Detroit is facing elimination after losing both games at home.\n\n\u201cWe want to win, so there\u2019s disappointment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not disheartened. I\u2019m looking forward to getting to the next game.\u201d\n\nThe most emotion Cunningham showed at his locker came when he asked about Detroit\u2019s second shot on the last possession. After he missed, the rebound came out to Tim Hardaway Jr. on the left baseline.\n\nHe also missed, but only after contact with Josh Hart. Hardaway and Cunningham agreed that it should have been a foul. Even the officials concurred.\n\n\u201cYou saw it,\u201d Hardaway said. \u201cIt was blatant.\u201d\n\nFor Cunningham, it was another frustrating moment in a series where he has struggled to get to the free-throw line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing different than what we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to say it was a surprise, because it was a foul, but I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\nThe Pistons had an unexpected ally in disputing the call.\n\n\u201cDuring live play, it was judged that Josh Hart made a legal defensive play,\u201d crew chief David Guthrie told a pool reporter after the game. \u201cAfter postgame review, we observed that Hart makes body contact that is more than marginal to Hardaway Jr. and a foul should have been called.\u201d\n\nCunningham missed a 15-footer with 1:07 to play, then turned the ball over with 37 seconds to go.\n\n\u201cCade has to carry us a lot on the offensive end of the floor,\u201d Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. \u201cHe has come through for us over and over again.\u201d\n\nThat made for an ugly finish to a historic game for Cunningham. He finished with 25 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds \u2014 just the third playoff triple-double in franchise history. The first two belonged to Isiah Thomas in 1986 and 1989.\n\nHe had only six points in the first half but put up 19 points, nine rebounds and seven assists as Detroit rallied in the second half.\n\n\u201cCunningham \u2014 that\u2019s a great player,\u201d Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. \u201cYou need your whole team tied together on that and you got to try to make him work.\u201d\n\nCunningham is averaging 25.8 points, 9.0 assists and 8.8 rebounds in his first playoff series, with at least one game to go.\n\n\u201cThis has been a lot of fun,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to still be playing basketball at this time of the year.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",

    "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Brandon Nimmo hit a grand slam and matched a franchise record with nine RBIs, helping the New York Mets pound Washington Nationals 19-5 on Monday.\n\nNimmo also hit a three-run drive in his seventh career multihomer game. The 32-year-old outfielder had four hits and scored four times after beginning the day with a .192 batting average.\n\nNew York earned a split of the four-game series. The Mets have won nine of 11 overall to improve to a major league-best 20-9.\n\nJeff McNeil and Mark Vientos also homered for New York, which finished with 21 hits. Vientos connected for a three-run drive against Washington infielder Amed Rosario in the ninth.\n\nJames Wood and Nathaniel Lowe homered for Washington in the eighth.\n\nThe Mets had a 3-0 lead when Colin Poche replaced Nationals starter Trevor Williams (1-3) with two on in the sixth. Nimmo greeted the left-hander by ripping a 2-0 fastball deep to right-center.\n\nAn inning later, the Mets had the bases loaded when Nimmo sent Cole Henry\u2019s fastball into the right-field seats for his second career grand slam.\n\nNimmo added a two-run double in the eighth to tie the franchise record for RBIs set by Carlos Delgado in the first game of a doubleheader against the New York Yankees on June 27, 2008.\n\nMcNeil, who made his season debut Friday after missing 25 games with a right oblique strain, hit the first pitch of the fifth deep to right for his first home run of the year.\n\nGriffin Canning (4-1) pitched five innings of four-hit ball for New York. He has won four consecutive starts for the first time in his six-season career.\n\nJos\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a earned his first save of the season. He allowed five runs in three innings in his Mets debut.\n\nWilliams yielded five runs in a season-high 5 1/3 innings.\n\nFrancisco Lindor was hit twice by Cole Henry pitches in the seventh. He became the ninth player to be hit twice in an inning and the first since the New York Yankees\u2019 Brandon Moss on April 25, 2014, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nKey moment\n\nNimmo\u2019s sixth-inning shot broke open the game.

    "title": "Freed Israeli hostage feared the \u2018many ways to die\u2019 in Gaza but kept hope alive",
    "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) \u2014 Whether the threat was abusive Hamas guards, hunger, illness or Israeli strikes, there were moments during Tal Shoham\u2019s 505 days of captivity in Gaza when he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be alive the next morning.\n\nThere were \u201cmany times that I separated from life and ... tried to accept death,\u201d the 40-year-old Israeli, who also holds Austrian citizenship, told The Associated Press. \u201cThere are so many ways to die there.\u201d\n\nShoham was one of dozens of hostages released from Gaza in February as part of a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel that has since been broken. His wife, two children and three other family members were also kidnapped on Oct. 7, 2023, and were freed a month later.\n\nShoham said he spent half his captivity in apartments and the rest in underground tunnels. He was sometimes bound, starved, beaten and threatened with death, and initially didn\u2019t know if his family was alive.\n\nAfter his wife was released, Shoham said, someone identifying himself as a member of Hamas called to warn her not to talk about what she\u2019d been through or they\u2019d kill her husband. So as he recounted his own experience, Shoham said there were details he wouldn\u2019t discuss, fearful of endangering remaining hostages.\n\nWith ceasefire talks at a standstill, Israel is vowing to advance deeper into Gaza until Hamas releases the 59 hostages still there, more than half of whom are believed dead.\n\nThe resumption of fighting has inflamed debate in Israel over the course of the war and the hostages\u2019 fate. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under mounting domestic pressure for his handling of the hostage crisis. But he also faces demands from his hard-line allies not to accept any deal that falls short of Hamas\u2019 destruction.\n\nThe abduction\n\nShoham was kidnapped while visiting relatives in Kibbutz Be\u2019eri. When Hamas attacked, he and his family hid in a safe room meant to offer protection from incoming rockets. But as militants pried open a window and used explosives to try to break in, the family surrendered, a decision Shoham credits with saving their lives.\n\nShoham was thrown into the back of a vehicle and taken into Gaza, not knowing what happened to his wife or children. Be\u2019eri was among the hardest-hit communities that day.\n\nBefore being separated, Shoham recalled telling his now 9-year-old son that he didn\u2019t know if they were going to die. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to hear a lie from me, if it\u2019s the last minutes of our life,\u201d he said.\n\nUpon entering Gaza, a militant jumped on the car\u2019s roof, pointed his gun at Shoham and told him to kneel. But Shoham refused, not wanting to be killed on their terms, he said.\n\nHe said the militant had \u201cmurder in his eyes.\u201d\n\nThe apartments\n\nShoham was first taken to an apartment that his captors said was in northern Gaza. He spent weeks there, handcuffed and confined to a room.\n\nAbout a month later, he was moved to another apartment and joined by Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, hostages he would spend most of his captivity with.\n\nThe two men were abducted from a music festival in southern Israel where at least 364 people were killed and dozens more taken hostage. Hearing about the conditions of their captivity made Shoham feel lucky about his own. They\u2019d been kept in more uncomfortable zip-tie handcuffs, with plastic bags on their heads, he said, and fed one pita per day.\n\nThe three lived in that apartment for months, where they endured daily beatings. Guards would taunt and humiliate them, asking how the music festival was and making shooting noises, Shoham said.\n\nForbidden by their captors from speaking, they got to know each other through furtive whispers.\n\nTo humanize himself in the eyes of his captors, and hopefully make them less likely to kill him, Shoham learned Arabic and talked with them about his life in Israel.\n\nOne of their guards liked massages, Shoham said, so the captives provided daily back rubs in exchange for more variety in their diet, like tuna, sardines and even eggs.\n\nShoham learned his wife and children were alive about 50 days into his captivity. In what he considered an act of kindness, his captors gave him a letter written by his wife that said she and their children were OK and would be released soon.\n\nHe credits that gesture by the guards with giving him more mental strength to focus on his own survival.\n\nThe tunnel\n\nLast June, Shoham, David and Gilboa-Dalal were relocated to a tunnel that they estimated to be about 30 meters (98 feet) underground.\n\nShoham said they were moved after Israel rescued four hostages from apartments in Gaza earlier that month, an operation that killed more than 270 Palestinians.\n\nThey were transported in an ambulance, Shoham said, cleanly shaved, dressed in clothes meant to make him blend in and blindfolded. Hamas operates from civilian areas, including hospitals, and Israel accuses Hamas militants of taking cover in ambulances and other emergency vehicles.\n\nThe tunnels were dark and damp, and it was hard to breathe, Shoham said. The three men were kept with another hostage, Omer Wenkert, who had been in the tunnels for much longer.\n\nThey shared a 12-meter-long (39-foot-long) cell and slept on mattresses on the ground, a meter away from a hole that was their toilet. They showered roughly every 21 days.\n\nShoham lost about 60 pounds (28 kilograms) while in captivity. He developed a leg infection that was so bad he couldn\u2019t walk for weeks. After a doctor visited and provided vitamins, he said his health improved.\n\nWhat also helped Shoham survive, he said, was focusing on what he could control. He started doing mindfulness activities he had learned from his wife, a psychologist, and discussed his feelings with the other hostages. \u201cThe only thing that I have power upon is my inner life,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told himself each day that he\u2019d eventually be free.\n\nBack home and healing\n\nShoham and Wenkert were freed together in the last release of living hostages before the ceasefire ended. The last thing Shoham told David and Gilboa-Dalal was to be strong and not lose hope.\n\nHamas later released a video showing the two men, sitting in a nearby vehicle, distressed as they were forced to watch the handover for released hostages that day. A group representing hostages\u2019 families called the video \u201csickening.\u201d\n\nShoham worries they\u2019re running out of time and is urging the government and the international community not to tie the hostages\u2019 fate to a ceasefire or a peace agreement.\n\n\u201cI really fear that if they won\u2019t be released soon, they probably will die there,\u201d he said.\n\nShoham says his own healing process has been made easier by knowing his family can relate to what he endured.\n\nAnd his freedom has helped the family properly mourn those killed on Oct. 7, including his wife\u2019s father. While he was in captivity, they\u2019d been so focused on his release, he said.\n\nSince returning home, Shoham has gained 35 pounds (16 kilograms), saying he wanted to eat everything and never felt full. Lately he\u2019s been trying to get back to his pre-captivity routine of intermittent fasting.\n\nWhile his leg is still not fully healed, Shoham says he\u2019s one of the lucky ones, in that he\u2019s not suffering from nightmares. He credits his children with helping him keep moving forward.\n\n\u201cWhen I can hear my children addressing us, like mother and father, mom and dad, saying both names, it\u2019s like music to the ears,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a family, we\u2019re all in the process of recovery now. But we are doing it together.\u201d",

    "body": "BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Jackson Holliday hit a second-inning grand slam, Dean Kremer turned in his best start of the young season and the Baltimore Orioles routed the Cleveland Guardians 9-1 on Wednesday night.\n\nHolliday snapped an 0-for-17 drought with a drive that carried into the Baltimore bullpen in center field off Gavin Williams (1-1) with one out in the second.\n\nKremer (2-2) entered the game with an ERA of 8.16 but allowed just one run \u2014 a homer by Gabriel Arias in the third \u2014 in 5 1/3 innings. He allowed four hits.\n\nRam\u00f3n Laureano hit a solo homer for the Orioles in the seventh, and Ryan O\u2019Hearn added one in Baltimore\u2019s four-run eighth.\n\nCleveland loaded the bases with one out in the eighth but failed to score.\n\nBaltimore did its pitchers few favors defensively. On three occasions, Cleveland hitters were credited with hits on plays that probably should have been made. Right fielder Heston Kjerstad did make a nice sliding catch along the warning track in right-center field in the sixth, denying an extra-base hit that may have scored two runs for Cleveland.\n\nWilliams allowed five runs, four hits and four walks in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out four.\n\nKey moment\n\nHolliday\u2019s grand slam was the second of his career \u2014 the 21-year-old infielder has hit only seven homers. The Orioles loaded the bases that inning with walks by Cedric Mullins and Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas and a single by Ryan Mountcastle.\n\nKey stat\n\nIn their seven wins this year, the Orioles have averaged 8.0 runs per game.

    "title": "Deadly US airstrike on Yemeni oil port escalates Trump\u2019s campaign against the Houthis",
    "body": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 A U.S. airstrike on an important oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels killed more than 70 people and wounded many others, the Iranian-backed rebel group said Friday, marking a major escalation in the military campaign President Donald Trump launched against the faction last month.\n\nThe overnight strike on the Ras Isa port sent massive fireballs billowing skyward and turned tanker trucks into burning wrecks. It was the first American attack on a Houthi-controlled oil facility in the new U.S. bombing campaign. It also came just before the resumption of negotiations in Rome between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program, which Washington has linked to its attacks in Yemen.\n\nThe U.S. is targeting the Houthis because of the group\u2019s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on Israel. The Houthis are the last militant group in Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d that is capable of regularly attacking Israel.\n\nThe port is a major hub for incoming fuel shipments that power areas of Yemen held by the Houthis, and analysts say the airstrike could seriously affect daily life there.\n\nThe Houthis, who said the attack killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, aired graphic footage of the aftermath on their al-Masirah satellite news channel, showing corpses strewn about the port and smashed tanker trucks. They denounced the strike as a \u201ccompletely unjustified aggression.\u201d\n\nThis photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows medics carrying a severely wounded person onto a stretcher after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.( Al Masirah TV via AP) This photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows medics carrying a severely wounded person onto a stretcher after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.( Al Masirah TV via AP) Share Share Facebook\n\nCopy Link copied\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nBluesky\n\nFlipboard\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit Read More\n\nAP AUDIO: US strikes on a Yemeni oil port kill 74 people, Houthis say, in deadliest attack of Trump campaign AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports U.S. airstrikes targeting an oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels killed more than 70 people with 170 others wounded, the group says.\n\n\u201cIt targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nIn this photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows a burning oil tanker after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.( Al Masirah TV via AP) In this photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows a burning oil tanker after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.( Al Masirah TV via AP) Share Share Facebook\n\nCopy Link copied\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nBluesky\n\nFlipboard\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit Read More\n\nU.S. Central Command declined to answer any questions about possible civilian casualties but referred to a statement in which it said \u201cthis strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen.\u201d\n\n\u201cU.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years,\u201d it said in its statement.\n\nA U.S. official said the attack sent a message to those supplying fuel to the Houthis despite sanctions. The official spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public.\n\nHours after the U.S. strike, the Houthis launched a missile toward Israel that was intercepted, the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and elsewhere. Meanwhile, the Houthis said they shot down another American MQ-9 Predator drone, which the U.S. official acknowledged.\n\nThe port\u2019s strategic significance\n\nThe Ras Isa port is a collection of oil tanks and equipment that sits in Yemen\u2019s Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. It is just off Kamaran Island, which has been targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes in recent days.\n\nBefore the Houthis took control of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, in 2014 and sent the government into exile, oil from the country\u2019s energy-rich Marib governorate moved through Ras Isa for export. But since the Houthis don\u2019t control that region, the port now serves as an import hub for gasoline, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas that help power those parts of Yemen the Houthis control.\n\nA deadly escalation of Trump\u2019s Yemen campaign\n\nThe new U.S. operation against the Houthis under Trump appears more extensive than attacks on the group were under President Joe Biden, an AP review found. The new campaign started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid from entering the Gaza Strip.\n\nFrom November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.\n\nAssessing the toll of the month-old U.S. airstrike campaign has been difficult because the military hasn\u2019t released information about the attacks, including what was targeted and how many people were killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don\u2019t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.\n\nThis photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows medics carrying a dead person after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.( Al Masirah TV via AP) This photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows medics carrying a dead person after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.( Al Masirah TV via AP) Share Share Facebook\n\nCopy Link copied\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nBluesky\n\nFlipboard\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit Read More\n\nThe Ras Isa port airstrike is the deadliest known attack yet in the month-old campaign. The actual cost in lives is hard to assess, said Luca Nevola, the senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a think tank.\n\n\u201cSince they are targeting civilian areas, there\u2019s a lot more victims. But it\u2019s also difficult to assess how many because the Houthis are releasing these umbrella statements that cover all the victims ... or tend to stress only the civilian victims,\u201d Nevola said.\n\nFurther complicating the situation is the U.S. strikes hitting military targets, said Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert at the Basha Report risk advisory firm. He pointed to an American attack that Trump highlighted online with black-and-white strike footage, which might have killed about 70 fighters.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Houthis claimed it was a tribal gathering, they neither released any footage nor named a single casualty, strongly suggesting the victims were not civilians but affiliated fighters,\u201d al-Basha said. \u201cHowever, the overnight strike on the Ras Isa Fuel Port marks the first mass-casualty incident the Houthis have openly acknowledged and publicized.\u201d\n\nThe AP analyzed satellite images of the port provided by Planet Labs PBC that showed destroyed oil tanks and vehicles, and what appeared to be oil leaking into the Red Sea.\n\nWim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with the Dutch peace organization PAX, said it appeared at least three fuel storage tanks had been destroyed and that oil had leaked from mooring pipelines.\n\nThe U.S. airstrikes continued overnight into early Saturday, with the Houthis reporting them in Yemen\u2019s al-Jawf, Sadaa and Sanaa governorates.\n\nThe U.S. accuses a Chinese company of aiding Houthi attacks\n\nA U.S. State Department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, accused a Chinese commercial satellite image provider, Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., of \u201cdirectly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.\u201d\n\nDuring a briefing with reporters, Bruce did not elaborate in detail. But she acknowledged a report by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the company linked to the People\u2019s Liberation Army has provided images allowing the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor.\n\nBruce said \u201cBeijing\u2019s support\u201d of the satellite company ... \u201ccontradicts their claims of being peace supporters.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question about the allegation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Friday: \u201cI am not familiar with the situation you mentioned.\u201d However, he insisted China is seen as urging countries \u201cto make more efforts conducive to regional peace and stability.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the escalations in the Red Sea situation, China has been playing a positive role in de-escalating the situation,\u201d Lin said. \u201cWho is promoting talks for peace and deescalating the tensions, and who is imposing sanctions and pressure?\u201d\n\nThe company didn\u2019t respond to request for comment. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned it in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Chang Guang is linked to the Chinese government. The U.S. government in the past has used images taken by American commercial satellite companies to share with allies, like Ukraine, to avoid releasing its own top-secret pictures.\n\nThis photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows medics carrying a wounded man into the hospital after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.( Al Masirah TV via AP) This photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows medics carrying a wounded man into the hospital after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.( Al Masirah TV via AP) Share Share Facebook\n\nCopy Link copied\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nBluesky\n\nFlipboard\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit Read More\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sam Mednick in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this report.",

At 5-25, the Rockies avoided joining the 1988 Baltimore Orioles as the only teams since 1901 to lose at least 26 of their first 30 games.\n\nDoyle homered on an inside fastball, ending an 0-for-20 skid with a 421-foot drive to left-center. He later doubled.\n\nRookie Chase Dollander (2-3), the Rockies\u2019 No. 9 overall pick in the 2023 amateur draft, allowed one run, two hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings with four strikeouts. Making his fifth big league start, he got his second win. Dollander came out after trying to pitch with a cracked fingernail.\n\nJake Bird, Seth Halvorsen and Zach Agnos finished a three-hitter, with Agnos getting three outs for his first major league save. Bird struck out two in 1 1/3 innings and has 24 strikeouts in 17 2/3 innings.\n\nColorado pitchers had allowed 14 hits in each of the first two games of the series.\n\nRyan McMahon went 0 for 3 and extended his hitless streak to a team record 0 for 34, one more than Desi Relaford in 2005. McMahon has two hits in his last 58 at-bats.\n\nDoyle\u2019s solo home run in the third inning ended a skid of 20 consecutive at-bats without a hit.\n\nSale (1-3) struck out a second-high 10 and walked none, allowing two runs and five hits. The Braves had won nine of their previous 11 games.\n\nSean Bouchard put Colorado ahead with an RBI groundout in the second, but Michael Harris hit a run-scoring groundout in the third.\n\nKey moment\n\nAfter replacing Dollander with a 2-1 lead, Bird struck out Ozzie Albies with runners on first and second. Atlanta didn\u2019t put a runner in scoring position for the remainder of the game.\n\nKey stat\n\nAtlanta\u2019s Eli White ended a streak of six consecutive games with at least one extra-base hit.\n\nUp next\n\nBraves: RHP Grant Holmes (2-1, 4.50) starts a homestand opener Friday against the Los Angeles Dodgers and RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto (3-2 and a major league-best 1.06)\n\nRockies: LHP Kyle Freeland (0-4, 5.93 ERA) starts Thursday at San Francisco, which goes with RHP Justin Verlander (0-2, 4.99).\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

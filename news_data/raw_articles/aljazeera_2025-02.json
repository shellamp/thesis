    "title": "Why is Donald Trump discontinuing the penny?",
    "body": "The one cent coin costs more to produce than its value and is nearly obsolete in retail. But it has its supporters.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has ordered the Treasury to stop minting new pennies, reviving an old debate about the value of the one cent coin.\n\nThe penny, Trump argued in a post on his Truth Social platform on February 9, is \u201cwasteful\u201d because the cost to make it far exceeds its currency value.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s rip the waste out of our great nation\u2019s budget, even if it\u2019s a penny at a time,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhy the push to retire the coin?\n\nDespite being worth only one cent, each penny costs nearly four cents to produce, according to the US Mint. That\u2019s due to the cost of the raw material \u2013 mostly zinc \u2013 and the moulding process.\n\nSome 3.2 billion pennies were minted in 2024, meaning a production cost of $12.8bn.\n\nCenturies of inflation have also made the penny, first minted in 1793, virtually obsolete. It has become so insignificant that it\u2019s no longer even practical for the cheapest retail items\u2014such as a gumball or a single piece of candy.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want them. They don\u2019t use them,\u201d Larry Jackson, a 65-year-old coin dealer in Atlanta told the Reuters news agency. \u201cThey sock them away in cans and drawers and jars \u2026 Even a 30-pound bag won\u2019t fetch you $50.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, the use of the penny tends to clog up retail transactions. If cashiers can skip counting pennies, they\u2019d save 2.5 seconds per check-out, according to a 2006 study by the National Association of Convenience Stores.\n\nIs there an argument to keep it?\n\nYes. Some penny advocates contend that the currency helps keep prices in check.\n\nBusinesses, they argue, will be more likely to round off prices upwards than downwards without the penny. That could have a marginal inflationary impact.\n\nAdditionally, they argue, pennies serve as a valuable source of funding for charities: Each individual contribution might be tiny, but it all adds up.\n\nOthers point out that scrapping the coin may force the government to churn out more nickels, an even bigger financial burden. Worth five cents, the nickel costs 13 cents apiece to produce.\n\nUltimately, however, most economists say losing the penny would have a negligible effect on consumers. That\u2019s because the vast majority of transactions are already cashless.\n\n\u201cI think at some point in history cancelling the penny would have been a bigger deal, but now people don\u2019t even carry them in their pockets,\u201d said economist Sean Snaith. \u201cThey\u2019re largely not in circulation.\u201d\n\nHave other countries tried scrapping the penny?\n\nYes, countries like Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the Netherlands have all phased out their smallest-denomination coins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Canada stopped minting the penny in 2013, it saved an estimated $11m annually, according to the Canadian government. Many retailers began rounding cash purchases to the nearest five-cent mark, while the government collected and recycled the pennies for their copper and zinc content.\n\nUS lawmakers have long advocated for similar measures. Starting in 1989, the late Arizona Congressman Jim Kolbe started a decades-long bid to eliminate the penny, introducing several failed bills to scrap it. \u201cThe penny has been a nuisance for years,\u201d he said back in 2006.\n\nIs it legal for Trump to stop penny production on his own?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear.\n\nCongress, which oversees the US Mint\u2019s operations, would likely need to pass a law to permanently retire the coin. But some legal experts say Trump could simply direct the treasury secretary to stop producing them.\n\nLegal scholar Laurence H Tribe pointed out that the secretary has the authority to mint coins in whatever amounts deemed necessary \u2013 potentially zero for the penny.\n\n\u201cUnlike a lot of what the new administration [of President Trump] has been doing pursuant to the flood of executive orders since January 20, this action seems to me entirely lawful and fully constitutional,\u201d said Tribe.\n\nRobert Triest, an economist professor at Northeastern University, says \u201cthe process of discontinuing the penny in the US is a little unclear\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt would likely require an act of Congress, but the secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,\u201d Triest was quoted by Northeastern Global News as saying in a January news article. Phasing out the penny, he added, would raise questions about how to round cash transactions and the use of people\u2019s existing collections of pennies.",

At the same time, Sanad also identified at least six homes razed in Tal as-Sultan, west of Rafah, a little more than 750 metres (820 yards) from the Egyptian border.\n\n\u201cThis is a war crime because they are destroying residential houses,\u201d Attar said, referring to the fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the destruction of private property.\n\nMeanwhile, Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said on Tuesday that Israeli attacks, unexploded ordnance, or fatal injuries sustained earlier have killed 118 people since the ceasefire agreement took effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to military breaches of the ceasefire, Israel has not allowed in sufficient amounts of essential humanitarian aid, such as food, fuel, tents, and emergency shelters.\n\nRafah Mayor Ahmed al-Sufi said most of the city\u2019s residents remain displaced, with an estimated 200,000 people sheltering in the al-Mawasi Khan Younis area and other locations across Gaza, unable to come home.\n\nAccording to him, initial estimates indicate that 90 percent of Rafah\u2019s homes have been damaged, with approximately 52,000 units suffering various degrees of destruction.",

    "body": "Trump\u2019s pronouncement on Gaza isn\u2019t the first time he has voiced his wholehearted support of Israel.\n\nThe return of US President Donald Trump has been hailed by parts of the Israeli public who see his second term as a return of uncritical support of Israel.\n\nTrump\u2019s predecessor, Joe Biden, supported Israel in its war on Gaza, as well as its invasion of Lebanon, but his administration\u2019s occasional misgivings about Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza, which is now thought to have killed close to 62,000 people, made parts of the Israeli public unhappy.\n\nTrump\u2019s involvement in a ceasefire that led to the release of some Israeli captives from Gaza and his enthusiastic suggestions of ethnically cleansing Gaza have raised Israeli hopes that his second term will be as pro-Israeli as his first.\n\nHere\u2019s how he has helped prop Israel up.\n\nDiplomacy\n\nTrump\u2019s diplomatic moves and appointments reflect his unwavering support for Israel.\n\nHe wants the US ambassador to Israel to be Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who opposes the two-state solution that would give Palestine a state and has even questioned whether \u201csuch a thing as a Palestinian exists\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s previous ambassador to Israel was the hardline, pro-settlement, David Friedman.\n\nTrump also nominated Elise Stefanik as US ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik says Israel has a \u201cbiblical right\u201d to the West Bank.\n\nIn 2017, Trump said all of Jerusalem was the capital of Israel, despite Palestinian plans to declare occupied East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.\n\nHe also moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nUnder Trump, the US cut all funding for the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA, in 2018.\n\nOne of the principles UNRWA was founded on was the Palestinian right to return to their homes they were ethnically cleansed from by Israel as it occupied Palestinian lands.\n\nIn November 2019, citing anti-Israel bias, the US was the only country to vote with Israel against all eight of the UN 4th committee resolutions aimed at supporting Palestinian rights, condemning Israeli settlements, upholding refugee protections, ensuring the supply of humanitarian aid, and reinforcing existing international law\n\nIn 2020, Trump pushed for the Abraham Accords, normalising relations between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco. This incentivised economic ties and security cooperation with Israel in return for US aid, or diplomatic support.\n\nSupport of Israeli territorial expansion\n\nIsrael\u2019s illegal settlements on Palestinian land and other moves to expand its territory were also staunchly supported by Trump.\n\nIn May 2019, Trump reversed decades of US policy and said the occupied Golan Heights were Israeli territory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in November 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo overruled his department\u2019s 1978 legal opinion that settlements were illegal, saying the \u201cestablishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not, per se, inconsistent with international law\u201d. International law is clear on the illegality.\n\nThe following year, Pompeo said the decision on whether to annex the Palestinian territory of the West Bank was an Israeli one.\n\nThe Trump administration was then silent on construction to expand the illegal settlement at Givat Hamatos near Jerusalem, which cut off parts of the city claimed by Palestinians.\n\nThe US was also silent when construction of new settlements at the flashpoint city of Hebron began in December 2019, and planners cited changed US policy as the reason to proceed.\n\nIn 2020, Trump presented the \u201cPeace to Prosperity Plan\u201d, ostensibly a peace plan.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan placed Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, dismissing Palestinian claims to occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nIt also envisioned Israel annexing large portions of the West Bank, legitimising many of the Israeli settlements deemed illegal under international law.\n\nWhat little of the Palestinian state that was allowed within the \u201cplan\u201d was fragmented, with limited sovereignty and subject to Israeli security control.\n\nThe proposals also required Palestinians to meet stringent conditions before statehood was conferred upon them, including disarming Hamas, recognising Israel as a Jewish state and renouncing resistance to Israeli occupation in return for economic investment but no sovereignty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plan was overwhelmingly rejected by Palestinians.\n\nAttacking international courts\n\nIn 2019, the ICC announced that there was a reasonable basis to investigate potential war crimes by Israel in the occupied West Bank, occupied East Jerusalem, and Gaza.\n\nThe Trump administration strongly opposed this, defending Israel and taking steps to undermine the court.\n\nThe following year, in the face of strident international opposition, it imposed sanctions on ICC officials, including Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, restricting their visas and freezing their assets.\n\nConfrontations with Israel\u2019s regional rivals\n\nDuring its first four years, the Trump administration was particularly focused on confronting many of Israel\u2019s regional rivals.\n\nEarly in its existence, the Trump administration pushed through increased sanctions on the Lebanese group Hezbollah, targeting its global financial network, and threatening sanctions and account closures against anyone who finances the group.\n\nHezbollah has confronted Israel on numerous occasions.\n\nIn 2018, following campaigning by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA), reimposing strict economic sanctions on Iran in a bid to economically cripple Israel\u2019s regional nemesis.\n\nIn April 2019, the US designated Iran\u2019s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a \u201cterror group\u201d, hoping to isolate it internationally and increase the costs on Iran \u201cfor its support of terrorist activity\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following year, the US went a step further, assassinating IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani, weakening Iran\u2019s regional influence and ability to hold military positions in other countries in the region, such as Iraq and Syria, from where Israel felt itself under threat.",

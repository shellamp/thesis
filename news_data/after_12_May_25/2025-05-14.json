    "body": "More inmates released early to stop prisons running out of space\n\n1 hour ago Share Save Paul Seddon Political reporter Sima Kotecha Senior UK correspondent Share Save\n\nWatch: \"We cannot allow\" prisons to reach zero capacity, justice secretary says\n\nMore than a thousand inmates will be released early to free up spaces in prisons in England and Wales, the justice secretary has announced, as the government grapples with an overcrowding crisis. Under the move, offenders serving one to four years who are recalled to prison for breaching their licences, will be released after 28 days. Shabana Mahmood said a \u00a34.7bn investment would fund more prisons, but said it would not be possible to \"build our way out of this crisis\". A senior Ministry of Justice (MoJ) official said the government would \"run out of prison places in just five months' time\" if action was not taken.\n\nLast week, the prisons minister told the BBC there would be no more emergency releases to deal with the overcrowding crisis in prisons. But Mahmood said the move would free up about 1,400 prison places and buy ministers time to overhaul a system \"on the brink of collapse\". The change would not apply to those who commit a serious further offence \u2013 or are deemed to pose a high risk, she said. In usual circumstances, these offenders would go in front of a parole board before being confirmed for release, but the government has decided to skip that part of the process, arguing they would have already been released if it was not for a backlog in parole assessments. The changes are expected to be introduced in the coming weeks. Mahmood warned that despite plans to start work on three prisons this year, it would not be possible to \"build our way out of this crisis\" and the government otherwise faced running out of spaces for male offenders by November. The latest prison-building initiative will be funded by a capital investment of \u00a34.7bn over the five years after 2026. Three prisons will be built, with work starting on a site near HMP Gartree in Leicestershire later this year, Mahmood added. A fourth prison, HMP Millsike near York, opened earlier this year. Changes from an upcoming review of sentencing, led by former Conservative minister David Gauke, were only likely to be felt from spring next year, she added. Amy Rees, the MoJ's interim permanent secretary, said that on the government's \"current trajectory\" England would \"entirely run out of prison places for adult men, in November of this year.\" The number of recalled prisoners has increased in recent years and they now make up 13,583 inmates from a total prison population of 88,087. This is only 1,355 spaces short of the total useable operational capacity of 89,442. It is estimated to increase to between 95,700 and 105,200 by March 2029, according to government analysis released last year. The changes announced on Wednesday would apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years, who have been released after serving their minimum period but recalled for breaching their terms of their licence, such as not sticking to their curfew. The scheme will not include those who have been sent back in for reoffending.",

    "body": "Trump's meeting with Sharaa, unthinkable just months ago, boosts Syrians' hopes\n\n2 hours ago Share Save Lyse Doucet Chief international correspondent Reporting from Riyadh Share Save\n\nReuters Donald Trump and Ahmed al-Sharaa met in Riyadh on Wednesday\n\nDonald Trump has said his administration is now exploring the possibility of normalising relations with Syria - his comments coming shortly after he met Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose forces ended the decades-long dictatorship of the Assad family. The extraordinary encounter, unthinkable just months ago, was short but significant. \"I think he has got the potential,\" Trump remarked after his meeting in Riyadh, 37 minutes long, with the former Syrian fighter formerly linked to Al-Qaeda. The $10m US bounty on his head was only lifted in December.\n\nVideo footage of their conversation in a lavish Saudi royal palace showed some initial awkwardness as they spoke through a translator. A beaming Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, sat next to them. The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan joined them by telephone. Trump acknowledged it was these two leaders who had convinced him to also lift the US's punishing Syria sanctions. His sudden announcement on Tuesday night at a major US-Saudi investment forum in Riyadh won him a standing ovation. It was a volte-face after his many previous posts on social media that the US had \"no interest in Syria\".\n\nWatch: 'Young, attractive guy' - Trump talks about Syrian president\n\n\"Tough guy, very strong past,\" is how Trump later described Sharaa to journalists travelling with his high-powered American delegation on his first official four-day tour. It was a very Trump gloss about Sharaa's old links to al-Qaeda. His Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria until he severed ties in 2016. HTS is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US and UK. Since assuming power in December, Sharaa has been wearing Western business suits and trying to present himself as a president for all Syrians. \"It's a new light at the end of this tunnel,\" exclaimed Hind Kabawat, minister of social affairs and labour, in the interim government. She told the BBC's Newshour programme they had been calling for sanctions relief ever since their \"Liberation Day\". The US decision sparked celebrations across a county where 90% of Syrians are said to be living in poverty, after more than a decade of civil war and profound suffering. Removing restrictions which cut Syria off from the international financial system will enable greater engagement by aid agencies and encourage foreign investment and trade.\n\nReuters The meeting took place on the second day of Trump's four-day tour of the Gulf",

    "title": "Celebrity Traitors: How will Stephen Fry, Alan Carr, Cat Burns and others fare in new reality show?",
    "body": "'Alan Carr could be frontrunner': Who will win celebrity Traitors?\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Alex Taylor \u2022 @Tayloredword BBC News Culture reporter Share Save\n\nBBC/Studio Lambert/Peacock/Euan Cherry The roundtable of stars joining Claudia Winkleman on Celebrity Traitors boasts household names\n\nThe line-up for UK's celebrity edition of The Traitors has finally been revealed - with enough star power to rival Graham Norton's chat show sofa. The 19-strong roundtable of stars joining Claudia Winkleman at Ardross Castle in Scotland boasts household names across sport and the arts. Among them are comedians Stephen Fry and Alan Carr, chat show host Jonathan Ross and Olympic diver Tom Daley - all vying to win the game of deception. Singers Paloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church will also be there, alongside others including historian David Olusoga, broadcaster Clare Balding, actress Celia Imrie and Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed. The third series of The Traitors, which aired in January, attracted more than 10 million viewers with its opening episode and 7.4m for its live finale. The show's format is deceptively simple. A handful of contestants, known as traitors, pick off their castmates, the faithful, with nightly \"murders\" - while the faithful try to work out their identity. If any traitors remain at the end, they nab the cash prize (though this time the money goes to a charity of the winner's choosing). The celebrity season, which airs this autumn, will bring a unique mix of fame, ego and public image to the popular format. BBC News speaks to psychologists to uncover likely faithfuls, traitors and frontrunners.\n\nThe comedians\n\nGetty Images Alan Carr hosts numerous TV shows\n\nAlan Carr, Jonathan Ross, Stephen Fry, Joe Wilkinson and Lucy Beaumont\n\nComedians are likely to be \"the obvious frontrunners to go the distance\", says Susie Masterson, a psychotherapist registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). Humour can be a highly adapted defence mechanism, she says, which can make comedians more opaque than other contestants. Comics are also quick on their feet, used to presenting a persona and masking in public - this makes them well-equipped traitors, notes Masterson. \"I think Alan Carr could well be a frontrunner,\" she says. \"There is an affability about him, but he's also not afraid of stirring the pot. He's very authentic and has a big personality without necessarily dominating the space.\" But fame could disadvantage the high-profile names in the group, like Jonathan Ross. Status, explains consultant counselling psychologist Dr Ritika Suk Birah, can create a power imbalance. \"It can make others feel threatened or suspicious of their motives, even when there's no evidence,\" she says. This may be a particular challenge for those understood as both intelligent and articulate, like Stephen Fry. This perception can lead others to assume strategic manipulation, potentially forcing early elimination out of fear rather than logic, adds Dr Birah. Unfortunately, Masterson also believes Fry could fit into the category of contestants who \"struggle with criticism or scrutiny\". \"He might struggle with banishing people as well as any potential heat he might receive,\" she says.\n\nThe singers\n\nGetty Images Welsh singer Charlotte Church\n\nPaloma Faith, Cat Burns and Charlotte Church\n\nStage performers like Cat Burns are used to high-pressure situations, interacting with a variety of people in a live environment. \"This could help at the round table,\" says Masterson. She adds that Paloma Faith and Charlotte Church are both \"big personalities and have direct communication styles\". While this may make them good motivators, Masterson is unsure whether they can appear contained or measured enough to endure as traitors.\n\nThe sports stars\n\nGetty Images Tom Daley is Britain's most decorated diver\n\nTom Daley, Joe Marler and Clare Balding\n\nSports people will likely make good faithfuls, says Masterson, as strong physical types tend to do better in most of the challenges and can also both lead and motivate the rest of the group. They are also usually goal-driven and able to handle pressure. \"They are quite different personalities in this group, and I'm interested to see how it might play out,\" says Masterson. \"Clare Balding is very practical and pragmatic, but we have also seen her emotional side on TV recently\". She feels Tom Daley, and to a lesser extent Balding, could well be \"golden retriever types\" - loyal and supportive - whereas rugby star Joe Marler may be less likely to want to talk things through. As for the in-built competitive edge, she says success depends on whether they can \"play as a team rather than against each other.\"\n\nThe actors\n\nGetty Images Celia Imrie's long screen career includes Absolutely Fabulous and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\n\nNick Mohammad, Mark Bonnar, Tameka Empson, Ruth Codd, Celia Imrie\n\nActors, like comics, may also face distrust depending on how much their castmates expect them to be naturally deceptive. However, among the group of actors, there is a good mix of ages, types of acting and levels of fame - from soap star Tameka Empson to established film names like Mark Bonnar and Celia Imrie. This could \"balance out this superficial disadvantage\" by muddying the threat level, says Masterson. She says cast members with lesser-known personalities, like Ruth Codd and Nick Mohammed, might be harder to read.\n\nThe media personalities\n\nGetty Images Historian and author David Olusoga has presented numerous documentaries\n\nDavid Olusoga, Niko Omilana and Kate Garraway",

    "body": "'My son was killed by criminals making cannabis'\n\n9 hours ago Share Save Mark Denten BBC Look North Duncan Leatherdale BBC News, North East and Cumbria Share Save\n\nFamily handout Archie York was killed in an explosion at a block of flats in October\n\nSeven-year-old Archie York was killed in a blast in Newcastle caused by his neighbour's illegal attempts to make cannabis sweets. As one of his killers is jailed, Archie's mother says her son's death should serve as a warning to other criminals.\n\nShortly before 01:00 BST on 16 October, the slumbering streets of Benwell were rent by the roar of an enormous explosion. Katherine Errington had been asleep in her bedroom with her seven-week-old son Finley, when the pair were suddenly bombarded with and buried beneath the walls and contents of their flat. She initially thought she was having a nightmare, but the taste of blood in her mouth quickly confirmed this was all too real. The utter panic and confusion was replaced by a realisation she was trapped beneath the debris of her home. She could hear her baby son crying but could not find him in the darkness and destruction - his cries soon gave way to a chilling silence.\n\nPA Media The explosion obliterated several homes on Violet Close\n\n\"I closed my eyes,\" Katherine recalls. \"I thought 'if my son's gone, as in unalive, I'll close my eyes and whatever happens I'll not remember it, I'll be asleep'.\" Then she heard the shouts of her partner Robbie, desperately searching for her and their baby, and she called back to him so he could zero in on her voice. Katherine managed to push her foot through the bricks into the dust-filled air, Robbie seizing it gratefully and starting to frantically dig her out, also, miraculously, finding Finley alive and pulling him to safety. \"I got out and looked at where my flat was supposed to be,\" she says. \"There was nothing left of it.\"\n\nNorthumbria Police A pile of rubble was left by the blast\n\nThe street outside had rapidly filled with neighbours and emergency services, with Katherine and her baby quickly rushed away for medical treatment. It was at the hospital where police officers told her the explosion had been even more devastating than she had imagined. Her eldest son, Archie, was \"gone\". The last time she had seen him, her \"perfect little boy\" and Robbie had been asleep on the living room settee.\n\nFamily handout Archie York loved superheroes and school, his mum said\n\nSeven-year-old Archie had been the dictionary definition of a \"mischievous cheeky boy\", his mum says. \"He was just a normal, happy little boy.\" He loved superheroes, computer games and school, where \"everybody loved him\", Katherine says. Archie had been overjoyed at the arrival of Finley almost two months earlier, wanting to feed him and change his nappies, maturing overnight into a proper big brother. \"It was just how a family should be,\" Katherine recalls. \"It was the best seven weeks of my life.\"\n\nFamily handout Archie was delighted to be a big brother, his family said\n\nWithin seconds, several houses on Violet Close were practically demolished and a huge fire was raging, with more than 100 people having to be evacuated from their homes. Initial suspicions were that it was a gas leak, a faulty boiler somewhere, but investigators quickly honed in on the activities of Katherine and Robbie's downstairs neighbour, 35-year-old Jason Laws, who was also killed in the blast, and his associate Reece Galbraith.\n\nKatherine Errington says her son's death has been devastating\n\n\"The scene was hell for almost two months,\" Det Ch Insp Katie Smith of Northumbria Police says, detailing the \"harrowing\" finger-tip searches officers had to make in the rubble in the days and weeks after the blast. A suspiciously large number of butane canisters were discovered scattered throughout the debris which, along with other industrial items such as a vacuum oven, indicated a factory making so-called shatter - a glassy-type substance used to form cannabis sweets - was operating in one of the flats. The blast was caused by a build-up of the highly flammable butane, the gas used in the production process, which was taking place while the neighbours all slept peacefully nearby.\n\nNorthumbria Police Police found dozens of butane canisters in the rubble\n\n\"The dangers go without saying,\" Det Ch Insp Smith says. \"[Galbraith and his associates] knew about the risks that night, it says on the side of the gas canister how highly flammable it is. \"They disregarded that to make some money from drugs. \"It caused utter devastation.\"\n\nDet Ch Insp Katie Smith said Galbraith and his associates knew the danger they were posing\n\nFor Katherine, finding out her son had been killed because of the illegal activities of a criminal neighbour only worsened her grief. \"It sickens me that it could have been prevented,\" she says. \"You are supposed to trust your neighbours. \"This is more upsetting for us because someone chose to do that, it was their choice, not ours.\" The day she was burying her boy, 33-year-old Galbraith was in court denying being responsible for his death.\n\nNorthumbria Police Reece Galbraith initially denied manslaughter before changing his pleas\n\nIt was only later, when confronted with the wealth of prosecution evidence against him including DNA, finger prints and mobile phone data, that Galbraith changed his plea and admitted manslaughter. His initial denials caused further pain and consternation for Katherine. \"He's got no compassion whatsoever, no remorse for anything he has done,\" she says. She says her life now is indescribable, the shock and grief at the loss of Archie still all-consuming. Katherine never would have thought the routine of kissing her son goodnight and laying out his school clothes for the next morning would be obliterated in such a violent manner.\n\nFamily handout Archie York will be remembered for being a happy cheeky boy, his family said\n\nBut she is also keen to ensure he is remembered for being the \"funny little cheeky boy\" who \"touched so many hearts\" rather than for the way he was killed. Katherine is also keen other criminals heed what happened. \"This should be enough to stop anyone trying to do any illegal activities,\" she says. \"[Galbraith] has now got a seven-year-old's death on his hands from his choice.\"\n\nNeither Katherine nor Robbie ever saw a future without Archie. Their son was going to be a rock for Finley, but the baby is now an only child with no memory of the brother who doted on him. \"I don't think we will ever move on from this,\" Katherine says. \"That day is going to haunt us to the day we die.\"\n\nA tribute left to Archie at the scene of the explosion as it stands today",

    "body": "Exceptionally low river levels raise fears over water supplies\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Malcolm Prior, Georgina Rannard, Jenny Kumah BBC Rural Affairs and Climate and Science teams Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nMany of the UK's rivers have hit exceptionally low levels and that could worsen in the next three months, according to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), raising questions over supplies to households, farmers and businesses. The warning comes after the driest spring in England since 1961, with northern regions experiencing the driest start to the year in nearly a century. Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales. The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions.\n\nThe next 2-3 weeks will be \"crucial\" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group. That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way. The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt. Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year. \"We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,\" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk. He had to start irrigating his fields in March. \"We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,\" he said. He warned that an extremely long drought would mean farmers struggle to produce food and more produce would need to be imported. The dry and sunny weather this year has led to a larger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared to in any other entire year.\n\nMalcolm Prior/BBC Nick Deane is worried about how early in the year he has been forced to irrigate his crops\n\nThe last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s. Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation. That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather. However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on. But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does \"potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,\" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.\n\nLast week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues. At the moment the key questions are when will it next rain and when it does, how much will there be. There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week. Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions. Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies. By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies. Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas. If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes. In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976. Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought. Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed. And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms.\n\nMalcolm Prior/BBC Tim Place is one of the six farmers who built their own 270,000 cubic metre reservoir to secure water supplies\n\nMr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than \u00a31m. It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions. But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult. A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs. He added: \"Over \u00a3104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers.\"\n\nAre the dry conditions linked to climate change?",

    "title": "What to know about Menendez brothers' case and when could they be released",
    "body": "What did Erik and Lyle Menendez do and when could they be released?\n\n9 hours ago Share Save Yasmin Rufo BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images Erik and Lyle were aged 18 and 21 when they killed their parents\n\nIn 1989, brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents by shooting them multiple times at close range at their mansion in Beverly Hills. They were found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. On Tuesday, a Los Angeles judge reduced their sentence, making them eligible for parole. There has been renewed public interest in the case after a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, was released in September.\n\nWhy was there a hearing to resentence the brothers?\n\nLast year, the previous district attorney of Los Angeles, George Gasc\u00f3n, requested a change to the brothers' sentence from life without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life. The hearing was put to Los Angeles County superior court Judge Michael Jesic on Tuesday who resentenced the brothers. \"I do believe they've done enough in the past 35 years that they should get that chance,\" he said, concluding a day-long hearing. Menendez sentences reduced, given them chance of freedom The brothers are eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law which allows individuals who committed crimes before the age of 26 to seek a reduced sentence. The siblings were aged 18 and 21 at the time. They are now aged 54 and 57.\n\nWhat happened at the hearing?\n\nWatch: \"Redemption is possible\" - Family and attorney of Menendez brothers react to resentencing\n\nDuring the hearing, family members and a former fellow inmate were among those who testified in support of the resentencing. People who worked with the brothers in prison spoke about the educational courses they had completed and how they created a hospice initiative for the elderly and sick. The district attorney's office, which fiercely opposes a lower sentence, said the brothers have continued to \"make excuses\" for their conduct instead of taking full responsibility and were not rehabilitated. The brothers spoke to the court via video and apologised for their actions. They also spoke about their hopes of working with sex abuse victims and helping those incarcerated if they were given a second chance outside prison.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe California parole board will now decide whether to release the brothers from prison. Separately, the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, is considering a request from the brothers for clemency. If approved, it could lead to a reduced sentence or a pardon. Governor Newsom requested that the parole board conduct a risk assessment that examines whether the brothers pose a risk to the general public if released. The full report has not been released, but the district attorney said it indicated a \"moderate risk of violence\". The parole board hearing on the clemency petition is set to take place on 13 June. It is unclear whether the board will also consider the possibility of parole based on Judge Jesic's resentencing at the same hearing.\n\nWhat did the Menendez brothers do?\n\nGetty Images A jury found the brothers guilty of murder in 1996\n\nLyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, on 20 August 1989 at their home in Beverly Hills. Their father, a 45-year-old Hollywood executive, was shot six times with a shotgun the brothers had purchased days before the attack. Their mother died after suffering 10 shotgun blasts to several parts of her body. The brothers initially told police they found their parents dead when they arrived home. They were arrested after the girlfriend of a psychologist that had been treating Erik Menendez went to police to say that he had physically threatened the doctor.\n\nWhy did the Menendez brothers kill their parents?\n\nThe brothers claimed they committed the murders in self defence after years of alleged physical, emotional and sexual abuse, although no molestation was ever proven in court. They said they feared their father would kill them after they threatened to expose him. However, prosecutors argued that the young men had killed their successful parents to inherit their multi-million-dollar estate.\n\nWhat happened during the Menendez trial?\n\nThe brothers were taken into custody in 1990 and in 1993 they were tried for the murders, first individually, with one jury for each brother. However, both juries were deadlocked in 1994, resulting in a mistrial, and the pair were later tried again together in 1995. During their joint trial the judge excluded apparent evidence of abuse from their defence case. Taped sessions with a doctor, in which the killings were discussed, were ruled admissible in court by the judge. A jury found them guilty and the pair were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996. The brothers, who were separated during their detention after a detective who investigated the slayings said they may conspire to escape if housed together, reunited in jail in 2018.\n\nWhat impact has the Netflix drama had on the case?\n\nNetflix Cooper Koch (left) and Nicholas Chavez played Erik and Lyle Menendez respectively in the 2024 Netflix series\n\nThe case was thrust back into the spotlight after Netflix released a drama series about the brothers in September. Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, shot to the top of the platform's streaming chart and was reported to have had 12.3 million views in its first weekend of release. It explores what might have led the siblings to kill their parents and it presents the murders from different perspectives. Its creators said the series was based on extensive research and it follows the events surrounding the murders. It includes the brothers' claims of abuse as well as showing things from the parents' point of view. The show introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released. The series was a follow-up to the controversial first Monsters series about US serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.\n\nWhat have the Menendez brothers said about the Netflix series?",

    "body": "For, against, undecided: Three GPs give their views on assisted dying\n\n19 hours ago Share Save Catherine Burns Health correspondent Vicki Loader Health producer Share Save\n\nBBC More than 1,000 GPs in England have shared their views about the assisted dying bill with BBC News\n\nIf you ask these three doctors about being GPs, their answers are remarkably similar. \"It can be the best job in the world,\" one tells me. It's \"a privilege\" another says. They all talk about how they love getting to know their patients and their families. But all three have different views on assisted dying. Right now, the law here is clear: medics cannot help patients to take their own lives. But that could change. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill is being debated in Parliament. And if it goes through, it will give some terminally ill patients in England and Wales the option of an assisted death. Here, three doctors - Abdul Farooq, Susi Caesar and Gurpreet Khaira, who all have a different view on assisted dying - tell us how they feel about the proposals. The three were among more than 1,000 GPs to respond to a BBC questionnaire on assisted dying.\n\n'A red line I would never cross'\n\nDr Abdul Farooq is 28 and relatively new to his career as a GP. We meet at his home in east London. He gives his baby daughter a bottle of milk before heading around the corner to pray in his local mosque. His religion is absolutely key to his views on assisted dying. \"I believe in the sanctity of life. As a Muslim, I believe that life is a gift from God, and that no one has the right to take that away,\" he says.\n\nDr Farooq feels taking your own life is wrong, and so, he says, it would be \"sinful\" for him to be involved in that process - even indirectly. If this law passed - and a patient came to him asking for help to die - he would refer them to another doctor. He says anything beyond that would be \"a red line I would never cross\". Dr Farooq's objections are also informed by his professional experience, particularly his time working in a hospital. He describes seeing \"undignified deaths\" - people passing away on busy wards - and says the health system is not getting the basics right in end-of-life care. \"There is so much we can do to make patients comfortable, if we have the right resources available,\" he tells me. \"We have a whole field of medicine called palliative medicine that is there to help people towards the end of their life. So why are we not throwing all our resources and money into that and actually making the process of death less scary?\" He's also concerned about specific parts of the proposed law. Doctors would have to assess if terminally ill patients are expected to die within six months before they are approved for an assisted death. Dr Farooq sees this as problematic. The final day or so is easy to predict, he says, but adds that some patients he's expected to die within six months can still be alive a year later. Is there anything that could change his mind on assisted dying? \"No,\" Dr Farooq says without hesitation. \"I'm strongly against it. Personally and professionally, I think it's the wrong thing to do for patients.\"\n\n'I'll be at the front of the queue to help'\n\nDr Susi Caesar has been a GP for 30 years and thinks she probably wouldn't have previously been so vocal in her support of assisted dying. Now, she says she is ready to \"stick her head above the parapet\". Recently she lost her beloved dad, Henning. We meet at a lake near Cirencester because being near water reminds her of him. \"My father was the most amazing person and this is so evocative of everything he loved,\" she says. \"The outdoors, walks, sailing, boats, kayaking, swimming.\"\n\nShe thinks Henning would be proud of her for talking to us about her views because he was a long-term believer in assisted dying. When he was diagnosed with a terminal illness, Dr Caesar says he became \"terribly scared about the manner of his dying\". \"My father was a very proud man, and the thing that was unbearable to him was the idea that he would lose control at the end of his life - of his bodily functions, of his mind, of his ability to be the person that he was.\" By the end, Dr Caesar says her father's \"medication never quite kept up with his symptoms.\" For her, the argument over assisted dying comes down to patient choice. \"Everybody is going to die. Every individual deserves the comfort of choice about how they die. I would want it for myself,\" she tells me. She acknowledges that many of her colleagues have \"very, very reasonable concerns\" about assisted dying. But she says \"we have the wisdom to set up systems that will work and get over some of these hurdles.\" I ask if Dr Caesar's support for assisted dying would translate into her working in this area. \"I will be at the front of the queue to help people to have the death that they wanted,\" she says. \"I think that's the core joy of my job - being with people to the very end of their health journey.\"\n\n'A very guilty place'\n\nDr Gurpreet Khaira doesn't have any of the certainty of Dr Farooq and Dr Caesar. She describes herself as \"pretty conflicted about the whole subject\" of assisted dying. Dr Khaira is a GP in Birmingham but also has first-hand experience as a patient. In 2017, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She found chemotherapy gruelling and says if the cancer ever came back, she wouldn't want to go through it again.\n\n\"I remember feeling very passionate that I should have the choice of whether I go through this kind of treatment, or to say 'that's enough now',\" she says. She says it felt very important for her to have a choice about the end of her life. Now, she's a picture of health, striding along a hillside with ease. As a GP with decades of experience, she worries that vulnerable patients might opt for assisted dying rather than be a burden to their loved ones. Or that some families might coerce vulnerable patients into it. \"That is one of my biggest areas of personal conflict. I know that there are lots of plans to put safeguards in. \"You can be the best doctor or advocate in the world, but you may not pick up where someone is being controlled or manipulated.\" For her, there's a fundamental conflict between her personal and professional experiences. But, she adds: \"As a doctor, I'd be very reluctant to be handing over a syringe for a patient to make that choice.\" Balancing up these two sides leaves her \"in a very guilty place\", she says, but adds that it's not a weakness to be open minded. For her, making this decision is an \"evolving process\".\n\nPersonal experience shaping opinions",

But then on 2 April, Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs hit all Chinese goods entering the US, eventually reaching 145% - and his clients asked him to pause production. \"I tried to keep smiling through my anxiety for the sake of my 40 workers,\" he told the BBC. On Wednesday, as a deal to ease the trade war came into effect, Mr Wang said his US buyers were back on the phone. Both countries still face some tariffs. There is at least a 30% tax on all Chinese goods entering the US and Beijing has kept a 10% levy on American goods coming into the country, down from 125%. But this surprise agreement after a weekend of negotiations in Switzerland has given factories and businesses some breathing room. \"At this time, our US client is willing to pay for the tariffs. Of course, we had to bargain with them as they asked us to lower some of our costs,\" he said.\n\nWatch: Inside the Chinese sofa factory left deserted by Trump tariffs\n\nMr Wang, who studied engineering in Delaware in the US, spent three years helping develop the air fryer model. It cost him $500,000 to set up his company and he said the tariffs came as a shock. \"It felt like my parents were getting a divorce. China and US are the most important economic and cultural powers in the world. Their sudden separation would lead to a world that we cannot imagine. Tariffs as high as 145% would mean we have to say goodbye to one another. But he adds, \"there's a saying in Chinese: good fortune comes out of bad\". Mr Wang believes his \"good fortune\" is that this trade war has accelerated his plan to diversify away from doing business with America. This is one of the reasons why Beijing believes it has the upper hand in its negotiations with Washington. China has choices and officials have been actively encouraging the country's firms to do more business in places like Africa, South America and South East Asia. Many other Chinese businesses have also told the BBC that they are looking to diversify away from the US to reduce their reliance on the market - suggesting in the long-term there could be more of a separation between the US and China, rather than a divorce.\n\nFactories have closed in the nearby city of Dongguan because of Trump's tariffs...\n\nDonald Trump has suggested that he may speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping by the end of this week. The world's two largest economies will now enter talks after agreeing to a ceasefire in their economic war for 90 days. Beijing has framed this deal as a win - not just for China but for all countries facing US tariffs. But it has come at a cost. A short walk through Shunde district - known as the \"capital of home appliances\" - presents a sobering assessment of a struggling manufacturing sector. Factory workers use the cooler evenings in Foshan to let off a little steam. They spill out into every corner of the local park. During the day they pack, mould and assemble nearly everything that you would find in your kitchen - from gas stoves and washing machines to kettles and fridges. At night, after leaving work, one group line dances in one corner of the small park, while a heated basketball match takes place in another part. Posters lining the walls of the streets tout \"stable work and easy\" jobs involving packing and screwing products for 30 days in a home appliance factory for 16 yuan an hour, to assembling air conditioning units for 20 yuan an hour. But agents told us that several factories had stopped hiring, especially those linked to the US - some had even shut down parts of their production line.\n\n... leaving workers struggling to find jobs\n\nThe BBC was told that several of these workers will sleep in the park to save money. Many of them travel to Foshan from their home towns, which can be hundreds of kilometres away. Several nearby hostels offer rooms for 20 yuan a night, which can be at least an hour's pay. Many will want to pocket whatever they earn to send it back to their families. This is the picture of China that President Trump's team have tried to present \u2013 one of sluggish growth, rising unemployment and a chronic housing crisis. \"We're not looking to hurt China,\" Mr Trump said after the trade agreement was announced, while adding that China was \"being hurt very badly\". \"They were closing up factories. They were having a lot of unrest, and they were very happy to be able to do something with us.\" This may be overstating Beijing's economic woes. This country is still leading the world when it comes to the production of electric vehicles and solar panels, and it is making significant headway in artificial intelligence technology. Officials in China have also continued to stress this country can take the pain of an economic war. But it is being keenly felt by some on the frontline and that may be part of why Beijing has started talking to the US.\n\nChinese business owners say their confidence in the US has been shaken\n\nThis latest \"ceasefire\" has prompted a rush of orders between the two countries as businesses wonder if it can last. He Ke, or HK to his American clients, has called his workers back from their home towns to restart his sofa business, Gongyuan Furniture. It ground to a halt even before Mr Trump's tariffs hit 145%. \"We had a day off straightaway,\" said Mr He. \"Once the tariffs hit 50%, we had already come to a standstill. When they hit 145%, we certainly could not do business. It was just not possible.\" His production line with around 200 workers once took up all four floors of the building. Since the Covid pandemic, he has only needed one floor and around 40 staff. But he still has the odd high-profile client \u2013 he claims Elon Musk sits on one of his sofas.\n\nAt a sofa company, production was halted and workers sent home when Trump's tariffs kicked in",

    "body": "How can traditional British TV survive the US streaming giants?\n\n19 hours ago Share Save Katie Razzall \u2022 @katierazz Culture and Media Editor Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nJust before Christmas, in a private dining room in the upmarket Charlotte Street Hotel in the heart of London's Fitzrovia area, the BBC's director general gathered some of the UK's leading TV creatives and executives for lunch. As they ate, surrounded by kaleidoscopic-patterned wallpaper and giant artworks, they were also chewing over the future survival of their own industry. As solutions were thrown around to what many see as an acute funding crisis in the age of global streaming, one of the invitees suggested, in passing, that BBC Studios (the corporation's commercial content-producing arm) could merge with Channel 4 to create a bigger, more powerful force to compete with the likes of Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon. As another diner knocked down the idea, I'm told that Tim Davie, the BBC's DG, asked why it was so ridiculous. I relate that not because it has come to fruition. It hasn't. Nor even to suggest that the Director General supports the idea. Instead the story illustrates the belief, among some within the broadcasting industry, that nothing should be off the table when it comes to contemplating how to ensure the survival of British-originated and British-focused TV as we know it.\n\nGetty Images With viewing habits having shifted, the industry is attempting to ensure the survival of British-originated and British-focused TV\n\nMany of the people I spoke to for this piece didn't want to be quoted. But Sir Peter Bazalgette, the former Chairman of ITV, told me that what he termed the current \"generous spread\" of British broadcasters (BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5) will need some consolidation or, at the very least, more cooperation in future. \"We're in danger of having no public service broadcasting within a decade, certainly within 20 years,\" he says. \"We don't have a strategy for their survival. It's that serious. The regulators need to start thinking about it. \"Mergers may well be part of the answer. There should be fewer companies in the future.\" Lord Vaizey, who was Culture Minister under David Cameron, put it baldly. \"ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 should merge. \"The UK only has room for two domestic broadcasters.\"\n\nAFP via Getty Images Tim Davie is set to give a speech on Wednesday that lays out his vision for, among other things, embracing the digital age\n\nOthers, however, argue that distinctiveness is good for viewers. Channel 5 President Sarah Rose told me she \"couldn't disagree with Ed Vaizey more\" \u2013 calling it a \"Doomsday prophecy\". Channel 5 is profitable, she tells me; it invests in smaller production companies and offers plurality for British audiences. By having just one commercial channel, \"You're taking the funnel from three to one types of content for British audiences.\" Channel 4 also rejects the suggestion of any merger. Its outgoing CEO Alex Mahon argues that, \"The unique structure of competition between our publicly funded and commercially funded broadcasters\" is what makes UK public service TV \"so excellent\". And yet the days of turning on your TV and finding an electronic programme guide listing channels \u2013 with BBC1 and BBC2 at the top, then ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 \u2013 are disappearing. The proposed date for the dawn of a new era is 2035; the end of traditional terrestrial TV as we know it. When the increasingly expensive contracts to provide broadcast channels and digital terrestrial services like Freeview come to an end, the UK's broadcasters are likely to pivot to offering digital-only video on demand. (However this won't happen without a campaign to ensure older people are protected, as well as rural and low-income households who may not have high quality internet access.) But if the aerials are turned off in 2035, is this the moment TV as we know it changes forever? If it becomes a battle between online-only British streamers and their better-funded US rivals, can the Brits survive? And, crucially, what will audiences be watching?\n\nHow TV could look by 2035\n\nFlash forward to switching on the television in 2035 and there will of course have been certain technological transformations \u2013 perhaps more immersive viewing experiences or some shows viewed through augmented reality glasses. What's highly likely, though, is that the communal big screen will still be a staple, (albeit probably voice-activated by then). It's a shift that has already begun with YouTube viewers changing their viewing habits and moving to the bigger screen. In 2024, for the first time, TV sets were the most-used device for watching content on the video sharing site at home, according to recent data from Barb Audiences. In all, 41% of YouTube viewing was done on TV sets, ahead of 31% on smartphones. With YouTube an apparently unstoppable force, in ten years' time it could well become the go-to viewing for the majority. \"We are likely to continue to see a shift in the share of viewing time and advertising revenue towards globally-scaled players and user-generated content platforms like YouTube and TikTok,\" all within the next five years, according to Kate Scott-Dawkins, Global President for Business Intelligence at media investment company Group M. There'll also likely be Netflix, Disney, Apple, Amazon. In other words, the global players, based in the US, many of which also have other revenue streams (whether parks, computer hardware or a vast shopping platform).\n\nGetty Images The BBC has lost income in real terms over the last 10 years through licence fee decline\n\nKate Scott-Dawkins tells me the UK broadcasters are facing what could be an \"existential\" battle against US-based media companies with \"wildly different business models\". The shift to streaming TV has, she says, \"enabled large globally-scaled players to get even bigger and pour money into content that they can put in front of worldwide audiences\". The \"big players with big pockets\" already pay for a bespoke button on certain remote controls, or their own content tile front and centre on the homepage on smart TVs. Ms Scott-Dawkins believes that in the future it will be \"a position of strength\" to own the operating systems themselves, as well as the media that people are watching on them. Examples include Apple showing its films and television series on Apple TVs and iPhones, or Amazon showing its own productions via its Fire devices, or Google through its own computers and phones.\n\nQuestions of revenue\n\nPart of the problem is that the UK terrestrial channels can't compete financially with the streamers. Netflix, for example, is valued at $472bn (\u00a3356bn). The BBC has lost 30% of its income \u2013 or \u00a31bn a year \u2013 in real terms since 2010, as the licence fee has become worth less. ITV's share price hasn't yet recovered since the advertising downturn in 2022, despite its vast production arm, ITV Studios, boosting its earnings before tax to \u00a3299m. Meanwhile, Channel 4's recorded a deficit of \u00a352m for 2023. Alex Mahon told Parliament last month, \"We will pretty much break even in the year\".\n\nGetty Images Sir Peter Bazalgette (seen here at the back with Big Brother contestants in 2005), is calling on regulators to make a strategy to secure the future of the industry\n\nSome TV insiders think the solution will be one gateway or app for all public service content: one place to find all shows from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and 5. Alex Mahon recently told a newspaper that there needs to be \"more collaboration\" between the UK broadcasters \u2013 a way of \"making sure we're not duplicating the same technology\". ITV has spent hundreds of millions to create ITVX, its streaming platform for the Netflix-age. Channel 4 took a pioneering approach to its own digital transformation, launching 4oD back in 2006; the first broadcaster in the world to offer television content on-demand. But while its current \u00a31bn a year revenue enables it to compete as a significant content creator, this may not be enough to sustain a modern distribution platform with all the associated investment costs into the long term, according to some insiders. Lord Hall, the former BBC Director General, is among those arguing that it's not sustainable for individual broadcasters to continue going it alone. \"The notion that everyone has their own portals when you are competing against the huge streamers is not going to survive into the future,\" he says.\n\n'One big streamer under iPlayer'?\n\nCould the solution be for BBC iPlayer, which has been built with public money, to become the portal for the other British public service media content, too? It would be a single place where viewers could find ITV's The Chase, Channel 4's The Great British Bake Off and Channel 5 News, alongside BBC's The Traitors. This was one idea suggested to me by multiple TV insiders. \"One big streamer under iPlayer\", as one TV executive described it to me, \"a modern public service streaming service\". Part of their argument is that it's the fastest growing streaming service in the UK \u2013 and the only existing platform of plausible scale to compete. With political support and the right deal, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 could potentially get behind sharing tech (after all, the streaming service Freely, which launched last year, already hosts their content with the BBC's and others). But the idea of branding this all under the BBC iPlayer is \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 not something that commercial broadcasters would likely entertain, according to conversations I've had.\n\nComic Relief via Getty Images Some have suggested that shows like Channel 4's Great British Bake Off could one day be made available on BBC iPlayer\n\nLord Hall believes, \"It could be branded differently... It would be a very good step.\" He says: \"The public would have to get used to the fact that BBC material would be free of advertising, and other parts of the platform would have adverts.\" If the idea of a shared streaming service sounds familiar, that's because it was proposed years ago. Project Kangaroo was a plan by BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 for a UK video-on-demand joint venture. Think an early rival to Netflix. But the UK's Competition Commission blocked the project in 2009 because of concerns it could harm competition in the emerging VoD market. Other regulators across Europe have also blocked mergers: In France, the TFI and M6 channels were prevented from merging. Two of the largest TV and radio broadcasters in the Netherlands, which would have combined eight national TV channels and four national radio stations, were also stopped for competition reasons. Any form of merger between different public service broadcasters would be subject to the same scrutiny. It's perhaps why Sir Peter Bazalgette is calling on UK politicians and regulators to focus on creating a strategy \u2013 or risk the end of British TV as we know it.\n\nShould the audiences care?\n\nThe BBC remains the most watched of the traditional broadcasters. Today, people in the UK spend more time watching traditional broadcasters than they do streaming services. Figures show 87% of people age four and above watch the traditional broadcasters each month and they spend an average of 137 minutes a day doing so. By comparison, 78% of people watch a streaming service and they spend only 40 minutes a day doing so. If this does shift and the pattern reverses, TV producers and executives may be worried. But does it really matter to audiences? Netflix is already making the types of shows that may have previously been made by the likes of the BBC (Adolescence, Toxic Town and Baby Reindeer are all very British stories made by the streamer). So what is the problem? (Aside from the obvious point that you need a subscription to watch Netflix.)\n\nGetty Images Netflix's hit show, Adolescence, sparked international conversations about male rage and misogynistic influences online\n\nMs Rose argues that the picture is \"much more complex\". Creatives involved in those shows often cut their teeth in public service TV, she says \u2013 one of benefits of the traditional broadcasters is, she believes, that it is a pipeline of talent. Sir Peter Bazalgette argues that they're needed more than ever in our AI age to serve as \"a gold standard of trusted news for our democracy, amid the online Tower of Babel.\" He also argues for programmes that reflect \"our shared values and national conversation\". Would a US-based streamer have chosen to make Mr Bates v the Post Office (ITV), for example, or 'Wolf Hall' (BBC) or 'It's A Sin' (Channel 4) \u2013 stories that are uniquely British and reflect who we are? Backing producers to take risks is, says Lord Hall, \"exactly what the BBC should be doing \u2013 but of course [it] has been doing less because the licence fee has been consistently cut\".\n\nStart of the 'martini streaming age'\n\nUltimately, the American streamers are here to stay; they're spending billions and their UK operations are often led by British executives who are supportive of Britain's public service broadcasting scene. I have also picked up a sense from those inside Netflix that the company is often used as a battering ram to persuade the government that the UK's traditional broadcasters need more protections. Some have also been critical of the BBC for, as they see it, wanting everything on its own terms: \"'We want you to give us your money for co-productions, but the BBC will make all the creative decisions',\" is how one insider put it to me, unfairly or not. In 2018, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was invited to the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. Invitees recall that he talked warmly about how influential the BBC's iPlayer had been to the success of Netflix, describing how impressed he had been by a piece of kit that had got British viewers used to getting their video on demand. With more than 17 million Brits now subscribed to Netflix, there is a certain irony to that. Today, as the BBC's Director General Tim Davie starts to position the BBC ahead of the renewal of the corporation's charter after 2027, the TV landscape is changing fast. And the challenges are clear. Lord Hall tells me: \"Our lives will be enriched by having not only what the streamers can offer, but also what the public service broadcasters can bring. It's unthinkable not to build on what the BBC and others can deliver\". Sir Peter Bazalgette predicts that, \"Small doesn't cut it,\" adding that, \"The winners will have to be big enough to [both] afford high end dramas for winning subscribers and maintain large back catalogues to keep subscribers happy.\" He says we now live in \"the 'martini' streaming age - any time, any place, anywhere\". The question is whether the leaders of the public service broadcasters can forge the right plan to safeguard their industry in that age.",

    "body": "Drug dealer who killed boy, 7, in explosion jailed\n\n8 hours ago Share Save Share Save\n\nFamily handout / BBC Archie York was killed in the Benwell explosion\n\nA man whose illegal cannabis factory exploded in a block of flats, killing seven-year-old Archie York, has been jailed for 14 years. Archie died when the blast caused by Reece Galbraith, 33, obliterated several homes in Benwell in the early hours of 16 October 2024, Newcastle Crown Court heard. The fatal explosion was caused by a build-up of butane created in the process of making drug-infused sweets in one of the flats by Jason Laws, 35, who was also killed, and Galbraith. Galbraith, of Gateshead, admitted two counts of manslaughter, with Archie's mother screaming at him in court that he had killed her son.\n\nNorthumbria Police Reece Galbraith admitted two counts of manslaughter\n\nMr Laws and Galbraith were using a ground-floor flat in the block of 12 homes on Violet Close to make so-called cannabis shatter, prosecutor David Brooke KC said. 'My son was killed by criminals making cannabis' At about 00:40 BST, their \"sophisticated\" factory exploded, killing Archie, who lived upstairs with his parents and baby brother, and totally destroying six homes, the court heard. Archie's mother Katherine Errington and seven-week-old brother Finlay were buried beneath bricks and debris, the pair having to be dug out and pulled to safety by his father Robbie York, the court heard.\n\nFamily handout Archie York was killed in the blast\n\nThere was then a \"fierce fire\" and the block ultimately had to be demolished, with dozens of people losing their homes and treasured possessions, Mr Brooke said. Archie had been asleep in his living room when the blast occurred and was killed instantly, while his father, mother and baby brother all \"miraculously\" survived, the court heard. Mr Brooke said there had also been an \"enormous impact\" on the local area, with the damage and costs to Newcastle City Council valued at \u00a33.7m, 81 adults and 59 children from 51 homes displaced and 10 households having to be permanently rehoused.\n\nPA Media The explosion severely damaged multiple homes\n\nMs Errington told the court her son's death had \"broken us in ways I didn't know possible\" and the family had \"lost everything\", adding she felt \"survivor's guilt\". In a fury, she angrily told Galbraith he \"took risks for profit\" before screaming at him: \"You killed my son.\" \"This was your choice,\" Ms Errington said. \"We will never forgive you for what you did to our beautiful boy.\" The court heard Archie's beloved dog Chase had also been killed in the blast.\n\nPA Media Archie's parents said they would never forgive their son's killer\n\nIn a statement read to the court, Mr York said he felt \"nothing but anger\" towards Galbraith and Mr Laws, adding he had \"no sympathy\" for the latter's death. \"They were making drugs whilst my family slept upstairs unaware of the danger that was below us,\" Mr York said. He said Galbraith and Mr Laws' illegal operation had put multiple children at risk while their own children slept safely elsewhere, adding: \"We worked hard for what we had and they did nothing but inflict pain and misery on others.\"\n\nAnother neighbour, who had lost her home of 18 years, said the men were horrible, selfish and greedy. One woman said her seven-month-old daughter had been blown across her bedroom and was found beneath a pile of drawers and bricks, with the woman fearing the girl would need medical treatment for the rest of her life.\n\nCPS Galbraith and Mr Laws were making cannabis sweets\n\nPolice found dozens of canisters of liquid butane gas and expensive equipment used to make cannabis shatter, a brittle substance containing a high concentration of the psychoactive compound THC which is used to form sweets from in the debris, the court heard. Mr Brooke said butane was used in the production process but it was \"highly dangerous\" and \"extremely flammable\". He said the canisters clearly displayed multiple vivid warnings which Mr Laws and Galbraith had ignored. Galbraith, of Rectory Road, had also been in the flat and was found in the wreckage covered in severe burns, going on to spend a month in a coma in hospital.\n\nPA Media Ten households lost their homes in the blast with dozens of people needing to be evacuated.\n\nHis finger prints were found on some of the butane canisters and on packages of cannabis sweets discovered in Mr Laws' car, Mr Brooke said, with evidence from his phones showing he had been selling cannabis sweets for at least 11 months before the blast. Galbraith, who also admitted producing and selling cannabis, had previous convictions related to the drug and was under police investigation at the time of the blast, the court heard. In mitigation, Richard Wright KC said Galbraith had not intended to harm or kill anybody and was \"genuinely sorry\".\n\nFamily handout A judge said Archie was a healthy, happy and much-loved boy\n\nMr Justice Cotter said Archie was a \"healthy, happy and much-loved seven-year-old\" with a \"wonderful and exciting life ahead of him\". The judge said the effect of the \"tragedy\" would \"never diminish for his parents\" and there was nothing which could ease their \"life sentence of grief\", adding: \"No sentence can cure their unimaginable pain, grief and loss.\" The operation run by Mr Laws and Galbraith was \"not easy\" and required extensive knowledge and research, much of which included explicit warnings about the \"inherently dangerous\" process of using butane, the judge said. He said it was miraculous more people were not seriously injured or killed.",

Westminster City Council said the extensive alterations, which involved altering ceiling heights, were denied planning permission, but completed regardless.

    "body": "Abortion decriminalisation plans pushed by Labour MP\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Sam Francis BBC News Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nA Labour MP has launched a bid to decriminalise abortions, after campaigners revealed estimates that police have prosecuted more than 100 women under abortion laws in recent years. Abortion remains a criminal offence in England and Wales unless under strict circumstances - including taking place before 24 weeks into the pregnancy with the approval of two doctors - under a 164-year-old law. Tonia Antoniazzi, Labour MP for Gower, tabled an amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill to decriminalise the process without \"changing anything about provision of abortion care\". Antoniazzi said the current situation was \"unacceptable\" and led to police prosecuting vulnerable women.\n\nNearly 60 MPs from Labour, the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Green Party and Plaid Cymru have put their names to Antoniazzi's amendment. MPs had been due to debate similar amendments last year, but Parliament was dissolved for the general election before this could take place.\n\nLast year a BBC investigation found an unprecedented number of women are being investigated by police on suspicion of illegally ending a pregnancy. Some investigations followed natural pregnancy loss, the report by File on 4 found. Pregnancy loss is investigated only if credible evidence suggests a crime, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council. The issue was in the news again this week when Nicola Packer, 45, was cleared by a jury of \"unlawfully administering\" herself with abortion pills at home during a coronavirus lockdown in 2020. She had taken prescribed abortion medicine when she was around 26 weeks pregnant, beyond the legal limit of 10 weeks for taking such medication at home. She told jurors she did not realise she had been pregnant for more than 10 weeks. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) said Ms Packer's trial demonstrated \"just how outdated and harmful\" current abortion law was and called for reform. RCOG are among several royal medical colleges, charities and trade unions backing Antoniazzi's amendment. Records collected by the UK's largest abortion services have found at least 100 women have been investigated for having an abortion in the last five years. Of those, six have appeared in court according to data collected by British Pregnancy Advisory Group (Bpas), National Unplanned Pregnancy Advisory Service (NUPAS) and MSI abortion services. Antoniazzi said: \"There is simply no world in which prosecuting a vulnerable woman who may have experienced a medical complication, miscarriage or stillbirth is the right course of action.\" She said her amendment, laid before Parliament on Tuesday, is \"tightly drawn - not changing anything about provision of abortion care, the time limit, the right to conscientious objection or any other aspects of abortion law\". She added: \"I am confident that, when Parliament has the opportunity to vote on these proposals, my colleagues will agree that never again should a woman be prosecuted for ending her own pregnancy in England and Wales.\"\n\nThe amendment follows repeated calls to repeal sections of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. Abortions were completely illegal under 19th Century law until it was modified by the 1967 Abortion Act, which initially allowed them to take place up to 28 weeks. This was reduced to 24 weeks in 1990. Abortions after 24 weeks are allowed only if: the woman's life is in danger\n\nthere is a severe fetal abnormality\n\nthe woman is at risk of grave physical and mental injury Since 2018, women in England have taken the second abortion pill at home, aligning the rules with Scotland and Wales. Though the same rules apply in Scotland, it has a distinct healthcare and legal system. Abortion laws are currently under review in Scotland following appeals from advocacy groups' to decriminalise the process. Abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in 2019. Latest figures show there were 251,377 abortions recorded in England and Wales in 2022 - the highest number since the Abortion Act was introduced and an increase of 17% over the previous year. About 88% of recorded abortions took place before 10 weeks, after which the procedure must be carried out in an approved clinic or NHS hospital.",

    "body": "Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 80, hospitals and rescuers say\n\n37 minutes ago Share Save David Gritten BBC News Share Save\n\nReuters Several homes in the northern Jabalia area were reportedly destroyed in the overnight strikes\n\nAt least 80 people have been killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza, hospitals and first responders say. The Indonesian hospital said 22 children and 15 women were among 50 people who died when several homes in the northern Jabalia area were hit overnight. Nearby al-Awda hospital said it had received the bodies of another nine people, seven of them children. The Israeli military said it struck Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters in the north. It had warned residents of Jabalia and neighbouring areas to evacuate on Tuesday after rockets were launched into Israel. It came as the UN's humanitarian chief urged members of the UN Security Council to take action to \"prevent genocide\" in Gaza.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting in New York on Tuesday, Tom Fletcher accused Israel of \"deliberately and unashamedly imposing inhumane conditions on civilians\". He also called on Israel to lift its 10-week blockade on Gaza and criticised the Israeli-US plan to take over the distribution of humanitarian aid by using private companies, saying it was a \"fig leaf for further violence and displacement\" of Palestinians. Israel's envoy to the UN, Danny Danon, said the accusations were \"baseless and outrageous\". He insisted the existing system for aid was \"broken\" because it was being used to help Hamas's war effort - an allegation both the UN and the armed group have denied.\n\nResidents of Jabalia town and its refugee camp reported hearing multiple explosions overnight, and videos shared by activists showed flames lighting up the sky. One video shared online showed at least 14 bodies wrapped in blankets and white shrouds on the floor of the Indonesian hospital. Hadi Moqbel, 42, said several members of his family were killed. \"They fired two rockets, they told us the house of Moqbel [had been hit],\" he told Reuters news agency as he clambered over the destroyed building. \"We came running, we saw body parts on the ground, children killed, [a] woman killed and a baby killed... He was two months old.\" The director of al-Awda hospital said in an audio message that it was struggling to deal with the 52 injured people brought there for treatment after the strikes because of the shortages of medical supplies and fuel for its electricity generators, with the latter forcing the closure of several departments. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency reported that 80 people had been killed in Israeli strikes across the territory since dawn, including 59 in the north. The Israeli military said in a statement that it \"struck Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists\" in northern Gaza overnight. It added that \"numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians\". On Tuesday night, the military had issued what it described as a \"final warning\" to residents of Jabalia and neighbouring areas. It ordered them to evacuate immediately to Gaza City, saying Israeli forces would \"attack with great force any area from which rockets are launched\". The military said three rockets launched from Gaza crossed into Israeli territory, triggering sirens in Israeli border communities and the town of Sderot. Two of the rockets were intercepted by the Israeli air force and the third fell in an open area, it added. PIJ - an armed group that like its ally Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - said it launched the rockets in response to what it called \"Zionist massacres\". On Wednesday afternoon, the Israeli military issued new evacuation orders for six parts of the northern Rimal neighbourhood of Gaza City, warning that there would be strikes \"due to Hamas's exploitation of civilian areas for terrorist activities\". An infographic identified the affected areas as al-Shifa hospital, the Islamic University, and the al-Shati, Carmel, Mustafa Hafez and al-Furqan school complexes, and alleged that they contained Hamas command centres, structures and meeting points. The areas are packed with tents housing thousands of displaced people. Al-Shifa is also one of only 22 partially functional hospitals in Gaza. It was largely destroyed in a two-week raid by Israeli forces last year but has since reopened its emergency department.\n\nReuters Casualties from the strikes on Jabalia were brought to nearby Indonesian hospital\n\nIsrael cut off all deliveries of aid and other supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its offensive against Hamas on 18 March after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire. The UN says 20% of the 2.1 million population has been displaced again, and that 70% of Gaza is now either within Israeli military \"no-go\" zones or under evacuation orders. Severe shortages of food and fuel have forced all UN-supported bakeries and more than 60% of the 180 community kitchens providing hot meals to shut down. A UN-backed assessment released on Monday warned that the entire population was facing high levels of acute food insecurity, with half a million people facing starvation. The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza's population. Israel has said it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of aid because thousands of lorry loads entered during the ceasefire. Palestinians are hoping Hamas's decision on Monday to release the last living Israeli-American hostage in Gaza, Edan Alexander, could pave the way for a possible new ceasefire deal with Israel and the end of the blockade. Hamas said it freed Mr Alexander as a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump, who is visiting the Middle East this week. On Wednesday morning, Trump told a summit of Gulf leaders in Riyadh that he was hopeful that more of the 58 hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza would be freed. \"All hostages must be released as a stepping stone to peace,\" he said. \"I think that's going to be happening.\" At the same time, his special envoys Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler participated in a new round of indirect talks in Doha along with officials from regional mediators Qatar and Egypt.

Brogan Stewart, 25, from West Yorkshire, Christopher Ringrose, 34, from Staffordshire, and Marco Pitzettu, 25, from Derbyshire, were part of an online group who \"idolised the Nazi regime\". Sheffield Crown Court was told how Stewart had detailed torturing a Muslim leader using an \"information extraction kit\". All three were found guilty of terrorism offences at the same court on Wednesday and are due to be sentenced on 17 July.\n\nCounter Terrorism Policing North East The trio had amassed a cache of weapons as part of their planning\n\nDuring the nine-week trial, the court heard more than 200 weapons including machetes, hunting knives, swords and crossbows were found at their homes. Ringrose had also begun to build a 3D-printed semi-automatic firearm, which counter-terror police said would have been a \"lethal weapon\". The three men had discussed targets for harassment and attacks including mosques, Islamic education centres and synagogues. The court heard how the group, who had never met in person and communicated online, were infiltrated by an undercover officer. Stewart, the group's leader, had told the officer that they needed to establish a \"new einsatzgruppe\" - a reference to Adolf Hitler's SS death squad.\n\nCounter Terrorism Policing North East The weapons were found after searches of the men's homes\n\nIn chats via the Telegram social media platform, he described how he had an \"information kit\" which included a blowtorch, pliers, gaffer tape, a screwdriver, bleach and a syringe. Stewart, from Tingley, near Leeds, went on to detail torturing victims such as \"local imams\" and added nothing \"loosened up\" people \"like seeing a syringe filled with bleach\", jurors were told. The group were also prepared for what they believed was an inevitable race war. The men were arrested after security services believed an attack could be imminent. Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley, the head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said the men had claimed what they were discussing was \"just harmless chat\". \"These men had bonded over extreme racial prejudice. They idolised the Nazi regime, they glorified mass killing,\" he said. \"They've physically amassed weapons, they've constructed a 3D-printed firearm and they were trying to identify potential targets. \"This was far more than fantasy. This was something that could have very easily moved into the real world.\" Stewart, Ringrose and Pitzettu were all found guilty of a charge of preparing acts of terrorism and charges of collecting information likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism. Ringrose was also convicted of manufacturing a prohibited weapon. Pitzettu pleaded guilty to obtaining an illegal stun gun at a previous hearing. The judge, Mrs Justice Cutts, told them: \"You must all expect substantial custodial sentences.\"\n\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.\n\nMore on this story Terror-accused discussed torturing imams - trial",

    "body": "Co-op says shelves to be more fully stocked this weekend\n\n9 hours ago Share Save Lucy Hooker & Imran Rahman-Jones Business & technology reporters Share Save\n\nBBC Shoppers have found some empty shelves over the past few weeks\n\nCo-op customers should see stocks on shelves start to return to more normal levels this weekend, the company said, after it announced it was switching its online ordering system for suppliers back on after a cyber-attack. The hack resulted in payment problems, widespread shortages of goods in shops, and compromised customer and staff data. The criminals, using the cyber crime service DragonForce, also claim to be responsible for a similar attack on Marks and Spencer (M&S) and an attempted hack of Harrods earlier this month. Co-op said it was bringing its systems \"gradually back online in a safe and controlled manner.\"\n\nEarlier this month, cyber criminals infiltrated the Co-op's IT networks apparently trying to extort money from the grocery chain. The company moved to limit the impact of the attack by shutting down some IT systems, including parts of its supply chain and logistics operations, resulting in huge disruption to deliveries. Shoppers have shared images of empty store shelves and fridges - which has been a particular issue in rural communities, where the retailer can be the only large food shop. Co-op says this should improve in the coming days in-store and online, as it works with its suppliers to restock. It says all payments systems, including contactless payments, are back up and running. In a statement, the company thanked \"colleagues, members, partners and suppliers for their support so far.\" Even though the retailer now hopes to move back to something like business as usual, experts caution the cyber attack will affect the Co-op for some time to come. \"The reputational impact of an attack like this is something that can linger\", Prof Oli Buckley, a cyber security expert at Loughborough University, told BBC News. \"Their work on the recovery helps to soften things slightly, but rebuilding trust is a bit harder,\" he said. The costs of recovery and upgrading security systems could also have a \"long-lasting ripple effect\" on the company's finances, he added. Customers will likely become \"more cautious about sharing personal and financial information,\" according to Dr Harjinder Lallie, reader in cyber security at the University of Warwick. The hack is a a reminder for the retail industry that more complicated IT systems and advanced attacks mean \"proactive investment in resilience is no longer optional - it's essential\", he said.",

BBC News has asked representatives for Granberry for comment.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Los Angeles judge ordered DDG, whose full name is Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr, to stay away from Bailey and their son until a hearing on 6 June.\n\nThe Little Mermaid star alleges he was repeatedly violent with her and made her fear for herself and their child.\n\nActress and singer Halle Bailey has been granted a restraining order against rapper and YouTube star DDG, her former boyfriend and the father of their one-year-old son.\n\nBailey and Granberry, 27, were in a relationship from 2022 until last year.\n\n\"I am seeking orders to protect myself and our son Halo from his ongoing abuse.\"\n\nIn documents requesting the order, reported by the Associated Press, Bailey said: \"Throughout our relationship, Darryl has been and continues to be physically, verbally, emotionally, and financially abusive towards me.\n\nDDG rose to fame on YouTube and has since released four albums\n\nIn the documents, the actress claims \"things got physical between us\" after Granberry repeatedly insulted her as she strapped the baby into a seat in his car in January.\n\n\"We fought each other, wrestling and tussling,\" she said. \"At one point, Darryl was pulling my hair. He then slammed my face on the steering wheel, causing my tooth to get chipped. I then stopped fighting back as I was in a lot of pain.\"\n\nBailey included photos of her tooth and bruises on her arms in her filing, which have since been published by some US media outlets.\n\nTwo months after the alleged altercation, Bailey alleges that Granberry entered her house when she wasn't home and texted her a photo of her bed along with a threatening message suggesting she was having sex with other men.\n\nA few days later, she claimed, Granberry berated her when she did not want to send their unwell baby on a visit with him, then smashed the Ring doorbell camera on her porch when he realised it was recording their confrontation.\n\nShe further alleged that, when she called a relative for help, he took her phone and slammed a car door on her as she was holding the baby. Bailey filed a police report over the incident.\n\nAs part of the restraining order, Granberry was also instructed not to possess any weapons. The judge can extend the order for up to five years at the 6 June hearing.\n\nBailey also requested that Granberry be ordered to stop using his social media platforms to continue \"bad mouthing me to his several millions of fans\".\n\n\"He claims I am withholding our son and that I am with other men. As a result, I then receive threats and hate on social media,\" she said in the documents.\n\nBailey shot to fame as part of Chloe x Halle, a pop duo with her sister, and later released music as a solo artist. She has been nominated for five Grammy Awards.\n\nAs an actress, she appeared in sitcom Grown-ish from 2018 to 2022. Her biggest role to date, however, was playing the titular character in Disney's 2023 live-action remake of The Little Mermaid.\n\nDDG rose to fame in the mid-2010s by posting videos on YouTube, and signed a record deal in 2018.

    "body": "'Go back to Ukraine': War refugees complain of abuse in Poland\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Will Vernon BBC News Reporting from Warsaw Share Save\n\nEPA At least 2.5 million Ukrainians live in Poland - making up nearly 7% of the country's total population\n\nSvitlana says her daughter loved her school in Poland. \"Even when we moved to another area, she didn't want to change schools,\" says the 31-year-old Ukrainian mother. \"She liked it so much. There was no bullying.\" Now she says the atmosphere at the school \u2013 and in Poland overall \u2013 has changed. \"Two weeks ago, she came home and said \"One boy said to me today, 'Go back to Ukraine'.\" Svitlana was astonished. She is one of dozens of Ukrainians living in Poland who have told the BBC that anti-Ukrainian sentiment has risen considerably in recent months. Many described experiencing abuse on public transport, bullying in schools and xenophobic material online. A polarising presidential election campaign has added to the tension, with the first round of voting taking place on Sunday.\n\nSvitlana says her daughter has been bullied at school for being Ukrainian\n\nThe day after Svitlana's daughter was told to go back to Ukraine, the abuse became even worse. \"Girls from the class above started complaining about her speaking Ukrainian. Then they pretended to fall to the ground shouting 'Missile! Get down!' and laughing,\" Svitlana says. \"She came home crying.\" A Russian missile had slammed into Svitlana's hometown in Ukraine days before, killing scores of civilians, including children. Her daughter was traumatised. Svitlana \u2013 not her real name did not want to be identified as she fears reprisals. She showed us screenshots of messages with school staff where she complains about her daughter's treatment. She said she had noticed attitudes changing towards Ukrainians in other places, too: \"At work, many people have been saying Ukrainians come here and behave badly. And my Ukrainian friends say they want to go home because Polish people don't accept us. It's frightening to live here now.\" According to government statistics, at least 2.5 million Ukrainians live in Poland, comprising almost 7% of the total population of Poland. When the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, there was an outpouring of compassion from Poles. \"It was amazing. Every day people were calling, asking, 'How can we help?'\" says activist Natalia Panchenko, head of the Warsaw-based 'Stand with Ukraine' Foundation.\n\nNatalia Panchenko's organisation has seen a rise in anti-Ukrainian abuse online - and in real life\n\n\"Some of them organised humanitarian convoys or brought refugees here. They gave their houses, food, everything they have \u2013 and their hearts, too.\" Three years later, Natalia says she believes the majority of Poles still support Ukraine. But some don't \u2013 and her organisation has noticed an upsurge of anti-Ukrainian online abuse that began several months ago. \"Then it started to come to real life,\" she says. \"Recently, we have more and more of these kinds of situations\u2026 xenophobic [abuse] of people working in shops or hotels just because they speak with a Ukrainian accent.\" Natalia says that many Ukrainian refugees are traumatised. \"These groups of women and children are in Poland because of the war, very often their relatives are on the front line, in captivity or dead... and this is the group of people being targeted.\" Research suggests that Poland's public opinion of Ukrainians is indeed worsening. According to a March 2025 poll by the respected CBOS Centre, just 50% of Poles are in favour of accepting Ukrainian refugees, a fall of seven percentage points in four months. Two years ago, the figure was 81%. Around a million Ukrainians are officially registered as having arrived after the start of the full-scale invasion. Poland spends 4.2% of its GDP on Ukrainian refugees.\n\nEPA Presidential front-runner Rafal Trzaskowski is playing down his pro-Ukrainian credentials in the campaign\n\nUkraine has become a hot-button political issue in Poland's crucial presidential election campaign. Far-right populist Slawomir Mentzen, currently polling third, is virulently anti-Ukrainian and supports an \"agreement\" with Russia's Vladimir Putin. In second place is conservative Karol Nawrocki, who opposes EU and Nato membership for Ukraine and financial assistance for refugees, but supports the war effort. The most pro-Ukraine candidate is front-runner Rafal Trzaskowski from Prime Minister Donald Tusk's coalition, although even he has promised a reduction in social welfare for Ukrainians. Trzaskowski has refrained from espousing his pro-Ukrainian credentials in order to attract the centrist vote in the elections, says political analyst Marcin Zaborowski. \"He's responding to the change in public attitudes. The initial enthusiasm for supporting war victims is disappearing, negative sentiments are taking over and it's not an entirely comfortable issue for him.\" Another far-right candidate, Grzegorz Braun, is under investigation by police for tearing down a Ukrainian flag from a city hall building during an election rally in April. Braun, who is polling at just 3%, regularly fulminates against what he calls the \"Ukrainisation of Poland\". Last week, the Polish government warned of an \"unprecedented attempt\" by Russia to interfere in the Polish elections by spreading \"false information among Polish citizens online\". Moscow denies all allegations of election interference.",

    "body": "European Commission wrong to deny release of von der Leyen messages, court says\n\nUrsula von der Leyen's text messages with the boss of Pfizer are at the centre of the case\n\nThe content of the messages between von der Leyen and Mr Bourla remains secret, in a simmering case that has become known in Brussels as Pfizergate.\n\nThat year, Pfizer signed billions of euros in vaccine contracts with the EU, including a deal for 1.8bn extra doses.\n\nThe General Court said the commission had not given a plausible explanation as to why the exchanges between its president and Pfizer's Albert Bourla could not be made public when an investigative journalist requested them in 2021.\n\nThe European Commission was wrong to refuse to release text messages sent by Ursula von der Leyen to the head of Pfizer during negotiations to secure Covid-19 vaccines, the EU's top court has ruled.\n\nAnti-corruption group Transparency International has hailed the European Court's ruling as a \"landmark victory for transparency in the EU\", adding that it should serve as a catalyst to put an end to a \"restrictive attitude to freedom of information\".\n\nVon der Leyen became Commission president in 2019, and within a year faced the task of leading the EU's response to the Covid pandemic.\n\nShe won a second five-year term late last year. Wednesday's ruling threatens to damage her reputation, because of the apparent lack of transparency surrounding the Pfizer vaccine deal, in which she played such a significant role.\n\nThe Commission said it would closely study the ruling and consider its next steps, but it insisted that transparency had \"always been of paramount importance\".\n\nThe controversy erupted in April 2021, when New York Times journalist Matina Stevis revealed how Ursula von der Leyen had negotiated privately with the Pfizer boss after his German partner BioNTech won regulatory approval for its Covid drug.\n\nThe article spurred investigative journalist Alexander Fanta, who worked for a German publication, to use a Freedom of Information request to see the exchange of messages between January 2021 and May 2022. But the European Commission turned him down, saying it did not have the documents.\n\nUnder the Commission's transparency rules, all staff including the president, have to archive their documents.\n\nHowever, mobile text messages are a grey area, and the case has largely hinged on whether or not they should be considered as important records.\n\nOne EU official argued this week that SMS messages were not \"systematically considered public documents\" and not recorded as such.\n\nFanta took the case to the European Ombudsman in 2021, where an inquiry found that the Commission's failure to look for the text messages beyond its usual record-keeping amounted to maladministration.\n\nStevis and the New York Times followed up, and when the messages were still not released, they took the European Commission to court.\n\nRuling on Stevis's challenge, the court said on Wednesday that the EU's executive had relied \"either on assumptions or on changing or imprecise information\", while the journalist and the New York Times had succeeded in rebutting their claims.\n\nThe court said that if a presumption was rebutted then it was up to the Commission to prove that documents either did not exist or it did not possess them.\n\nThe Commission had not clarified whether or not the text messages had been deleted, the court ruled, and if they had been deleted, whether that was done deliberately or whether von der Leyen had since changed her mobile phone.",

    "title": "Menendez brothers resentenced: Pair eligible for parole",
    "body": "Judge cuts Menendez brothers' sentences giving them chance of freedom\n\n16 hours ago Share Save Christal Hayes BBC News Reporting from Van Nuys Courthouse in Los Angeles County Share Save\n\nCalifornia Department of Corrections Erik Menendez (left) and Lyle Menendez, in undated police photos\n\nA Los Angeles judge has reduced the sentence of Erik and Lyle Menendez, making them eligible for parole more than 30 years after they killed their parents in a Beverly Hills mansion. Judge Michael Jesic resentenced the brothers on Tuesday, after hearing evidence from relatives and prison staff about their attempts to make amends while behind bars. The district attorney had argued that they were not rehabilitated, but now the state parole board will consider the possibility of the brothers' release as early as next month. The brothers have long argued that they killed Kitty and Jose Menendez out of self-defence after years of sexual abuse, in a high-profile case that prompted a Netflix show which renewed interest in the story.\n\nAfter hearing that they had been resentenced to 50 years to life with the possibility of parole, the brothers delivered an emotional statement to the court. They went through grim details of the brutal killings and their decision to reload their shotguns and keep shooting their parents at point-blank range in the living room of their home. The siblings were aged 18 and 21 at the time. \"I had to stop being selfish and immature to really understand what my parents went though in those last moments,\" Erik Menendez, 54, told the court. He described the \"shock, confusion and betrayal\" they must have felt seeing their sons holding guns and opening fire. When might the Menendez brothers be released? Both apologised for their actions and talked about their hopes of working with sex abuse victims and helping those incarcerated if they were given a second chance outside prison. The voice of Lyle Menendez, 57, cracked as he talked about the impact of his \"unfathomable\" actions on their relatives. \"I lied to you and forced you into a spotlight of public humiliation,\" he said to his family. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the decision to resentence the pair was \"monumental\" and carried \"significant implications for the families involved\". Much of the hearing centred on what the brothers have been doing in prison for the last 30 years. Family members and those who worked with them in prison detailed the educational courses they completed and programmes they created to improve the lives of inmates, including a hospice initiative for the elderly and sick. Judge Jesic called the brothers' work while in prison \"remarkable\", but noted that their 1996 sentences to life without parole were justified at the time. He said that under the guidelines, they were eligible for resentencing, issuing his new sentence of 50 years to life. The brothers have been held in custody since 1990.\n\n'A great day'\n\nAs the judge continued reading, the brothers smiled and waved to their attorneys and family members who crowded into the courtroom. Family members embraced with smiles. \"Today is a great day,\" defence lawyer Mark Geragos told reporters outside court. He said they were \"one huge step closer to bringing the boys home\". Anamaria Baralt, the brothers' cousin who testified inside court earlier in the day, said their family was elated. \"It is a difficult process,\" she said of the parole hearing that awaits the brothers, but noted they will \"eagerly step through those doors if it means we can have them home\".\n\nWatch: \"Redemption is possible\" - Family and attorney of Menendez brothers react to resentencing\n\nInside court earlier, relatives pleaded with the judge to allow the siblings' release. Ms Baralt, who said she has been close with them since they were children, told the judge they deserved a \"second chance at life\". \"It's been a nightmare,\" she said. \"I am desperate for this process to be over.\" Ms Baralt told the court she speaks with the brothers frequently and testified that they had taken \"ownership of their actions\". Prosecutors claim retaliation by new LA DA over Menendez brothers support\n\nWhat is the controversy around Netflix's Menendez drama? She said Lyle Menendez had acknowledged to her he had asked a witness to lie when testifying at their previous trial. But she added: \"They are very different men from the boys they were.\" The judge also heard from a retired Florida judge - who said he has never testified on behalf of any criminal defendant - and Anerae \"X-Raided\" Brown, a rapper who was in prison with both brothers and credits their help for his release. The district attorney's office, which fiercely opposes the brothers being released, questioned each witness about Erik and Lyle Menendez's \"litany of lies\" they have clung to since the murders.\n\nGetty Images Menendez brothers, Erik, left, and Lyle on the steps of their Beverly Hills home in November 1989\n\nProsecutors said they lied to law enforcement immediately after the crimes, lied to family members about their guilt and gave false evidence at their trials. Prosecutors have said the brothers have continued to \"make excuses\" for their conduct instead of taking full responsibility. \"There's no doubt they've done all these positive things in prison,\" Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian said in his closing argument. But, he added, when reversing a jury's unanimous verdict in such a brutal murder case, it's important to \"make certain they are truly rehabilitated\". The case was thrust back into the spotlight after a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, as well as the release of docudrama, The Menendez Brothers. It introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released. The previous district attorney, George Gasc\u00f3n, backed their resentencing bid, allowing the effort to go before a judge.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nGetty Images",

    "title": "Saudi Arabia 2034 World Cup: Human rights groups warn of migrant worker deaths",
    "body": "Human rights groups warn of 'surge' in migrant worker deaths in Saudi Arabia\n\n11 hours ago Share Save Caroline Hawley BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Share Save\n\nNurPhoto/Getty\n\nHuman rights groups are warning of a \"surge\" of deaths of migrant construction workers in Saudi Arabia, as it prepares to host the World Cup in 2034. Labourers are already dying from preventable workplace accidents in the country, according to Human Rights Watch and FairSquare which have both published reports today. Many such deaths are wrongly classified as having occurred due to natural causes and the families of workers are not compensated, the reports say. Both groups have called on the Saudi Authorities to ensure basic safety protections for the country's huge migrant work-force.\n\n\"The 2034 Saudi World Cup will be the largest and most expensive ever, but it could also have the highest cost in human lives, as millions of migrant workers build infrastructure, including 11 new stadiums, a rail and transit network, and 185,000 hotel rooms,\" Minky Worden, director of Global Initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said. The warnings come a day after the President of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, visited the country along with Donald Trump - attending a US-Saudi investment forum. FIFA \u2013 football's global governing body - says it has a \"steadfast commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights in the context of its operations.\" But Human Rights Watch has accused FIFA of failing to learn lessons from migrant worker deaths in the lead-up to the World Cup in Qatar in 2022. Data on migrant deaths is hard to come by in a country where human rights groups have very limited access and labour unions are banned. But Human Rights Watch interviewed the families of 31 workers from Bangladesh, India and Nepal who fell from heights, were crushed or decapitated by heavy machinery or were electrocuted. Heat is another major concern, as Saudi Arabia ramps up construction work in preparation for hosting the 2034 tournament.\n\nIn March, a Pakistani foreman, Muhammad Arshad, was reported to have fallen from a construction site at a stadium being built in the eastern city of Al Khobar \u2013 the first death related to the World Cup. Last year, the Saudi government said that there had been \"tangible achievements\" in occupational health and safety, with rates of deaths and injuries decreasing. FIFA also praised \"significant steps\" taken by Saudi Arabia to reform its labour laws since 2018. But the global construction worker's union, BWI, said there had been an \"alarming rise\" in accidents that could have been prevented. \"These are the result of systematic negligence, corruption and inadequate oversight and accountability,\" said BWI General Secretary, Ambet Yuson. And Saudi medical authorities rarely conduct autopsies to establish the exact cause of migrant workers' deaths, according to FairSquare. \"Hundreds of thousands of young men, many of whom have young families, are being pitched into a labour system that poses a serious risk to their lives, a medical system that doesn't have the capacity to determine the cause of their deaths, and a political system that doesn't appear to either protect them or find out how they died, let alone compensate the families shattered by Saudi Arabia's negligence,\" FairSquare co-director James Lynch said. He described FIFA's human rights policies as a \"sham.\" \"While FIFA praises Saudi Arabia to the rafters and highly-paid western law firms generate vast profits for curating Saudi's reputation, children in places like Nepal grow up without their fathers and never even learn how they died, he said.\"\n\nNurPhoto/Getty Images The Saudi government says there have been improvements to its occupational health and safety, but rights groups are sceptical of the changes",

    "body": "Scared and malnourished - footage from Gaza shows plight of children and aftermath of Israeli strike\n\n17 hours ago Share Save Fergal Keane Special correspondent Reporting from Amman Share Save\n\nBBC cameraman captures Israeli strike on Gaza hospital\n\nThe war's horrors multiply. The dead, the pieces of the dead. The dying. The starving. More and more of them now \u2013 all the weight of human suffering witnessed by my brave colleagues in Gaza. The urge to avert our gaze can be overpowering. But the cameramen who work for the BBC cannot turn away, and on Tuesday one of them became a casualty himself. For their safety we do not reveal the names of our colleagues in Gaza. Our cameraman was not seriously wounded, but that was a matter of luck. The Israeli bombs launched into the car park of the European Hospital in Khan Younis killed and wounded dozens. The Israelis say the leader of Hamas was hiding in a command-and-control compound under the hospital. The army said it conducted a \"precise strike\" - and blamed Hamas for\"cynically and cruelly exploiting the civilian population in and around the hospital\". Hamas denies such charges.\n\nAt the time of the attack, families whose sick children are to be evacuated from Gaza were gathering in the hospital. There were also families waiting to meet children returning from treatment abroad. One of the fathers was with our BBC colleague and was wounded by the bombs. He has now been discharged from hospital. Harrowing images show our journalist trying to console the man's terrified children. Warning: This report contains distressing images.\n\nMuch of my colleague's work in recent days has focused on the plight of malnourished children. A short time before the blast, I messaged to thank him for his work filming, with immense sensitivity, the story of Siwar Ashour. This was his response: \"Siwar's story broke something in all of us, and working on it was one of the most painful things I've ever had to do. But I knew her face, her name, and her story had to be seen \u2013 had to be heard.\" Siwar is five months old and acutely malnourished, a child whose large, brown eyes dominate her shrunken frame. They follow her mother Najwa's every move. On Tuesday Najwa sent us a video message from her room at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza. She wanted the world to know how much she loves her child. \"I wish she could receive the treatment she needs, to recover fully, and return as she was before \u2013 to play like other children, to grow and gain weight like other children.

Sores have appeared on her hands. She also has a severe gastrointestinal condition. The battle is to keep nourishment inside her. Her immune system is fighting the deprivation caused by the Israeli blockade. The baby's cry is weak, yet it is full of urgency, the sound of a life struggling for its survival. Siwar can only drink a special milk formula due to severe allergies. On Tuesday there was some better news. Medics at the nearby Jordanian Field Hospital managed to find some of the formula she needs. It is a small amount but they plan to send more.\n\nAsma Al-Nashash's children are stuck in Gaza\n\nIn the coming days there are plans to bring sick children to the United Arab Emirates and Jordan. Here in Amman there are already several Gaza families who have children being treated for illness or war injuries in local hospitals. These evacuations are co-ordinated with the Israelis who do background checks on the parents travelling with their children. In January we filmed the arrival of Abdelrahman al-Nashash and his mum Asma. Abdelrahman lost his leg in an Israeli bombing. For four months they've lived in a place with food and shelter. A safe place. When we visited them on Tuesday Asma called her children and their grandmother in Gaza.\n\nThe children in the photo are trapped in Gaza with their grandmother Najwa",

    "body": "Uruguay's Jos\u00e9 Mujica, world's 'poorest president', dies\n\n20 hours ago Share Save Gerardo Lissardy BBC News Mundo Share Save\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nFormer Uruguayan President Jos\u00e9 Mujica, known as \"Pepe\", has died at the age of 89. The ex-guerrilla who governed Uruguay from 2010 to 2015 was known as the world's \"poorest president\" because of his modest lifestyle. Current President Yamand\u00fa Orsi announced his predecessor's death on X, writing: \"thank you for everything you gave us and for your deep love for your people.\" The politician's cause of death is not known but he had been suffering from oesophageal cancer.\n\nBecause of the simple way he lived as president, his criticism of consumerism and the social reforms he promoted - which, among other things, meant Uruguay became the first country to legalise the recreational use of marijuana - Mujica became a well-known political figure in Latin America and beyond. His global popularity is unusual for a president of Uruguay, a country with just 3.4 million inhabitants where his legacy has also generated some controversy. In fact, even though many tended to see Mujica as someone outside the political class, that was not the case. He said his passion for politics, as well as for books and working the land, was passed on to him by his mother, who raised him in a middle-class home in Montevideo, the capital city. As a young man, Mujica was a member of the National Party, one of Uruguay's traditional political forces, which later became the centre-right opposition to his government. In the 1960s, he helped set up the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement (MLN-T), a leftist urban guerrilla group that carried out assaults, kidnappings and executions, although he always maintained that he did not commit any murder. Influenced by the Cuban revolution and international socialism, the MLN-T launched a campaign of clandestine resistance against the Uruguayan government, which at the time was constitutional and democratic, although the left accused it of being increasingly authoritarian. During this period, Mujica was captured four times. On one of those occasions, in 1970, he was shot six times and nearly died.\n\nGetty Images Mujica will be remembered for the simple lifestyle he adopted in and out of politics\n\nHe escaped from prison twice, on one occasion through a tunnel with 105 other MLN-T prisoners, in one of the largest escapes in Uruguayan prison history. When the Uruguayan military staged a coup in 1973, they included him in a group of \"nine hostages\" who they threatened to kill if the guerrillas continued their attacks. During the more than 14 years he spent in prison during the 1970s and 1980s, he was tortured and spent most of that time in harsh conditions and isolation, until he was freed in 1985 when Uruguay returned to democracy. He used to say that during his time in prison, he experienced madness first hand, suffering from delusions and even talking to ants. The day he was freed was his happiest memory, he says: \"Becoming president was insignificant compared to that.\"\n\nAGENCIA CAMARATRES/AFP via Getty Images Mujica (left) on the day he was freed in Montevideo in March 1985\n\nFrom guerrilla to president\n\nA few years after his release, he served as a lawmaker, both in the Chamber of Representatives and in the Senate, the country's lower and upper houses respectively. In 2005, he became minister in the first government of the Frente Amplio, the Uruguayan leftist coalition, before becoming Uruguay's president in 2010. He was 74 years old at the time, and, to the rest of the world, still unknown. His election marked an important moment for the Latin American left, which was already strong on the continent at that time. Mujica became leader alongside other left-wing presidents such as Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in Brazil and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela. However, Mujica governed in his own way, demonstrating pragmatism and audacity on several occasions, political commentators say.\n\nDuring his administration, amid a fairly favourable international context, the Uruguayan economy grew at an average annual rate of 5.4%, poverty was reduced, and unemployment remained low. Uruguay also drew global attention for the social laws passed by parliament during those years, such as the legalisation of abortion, the recognition of same-sex marriage, and state regulation of the marijuana market. While in office, Mujica rejected moving into the presidential residence (a mansion), as heads of state around the world usually do. Instead, he remained with his wife - politician and former guerrilla Luc\u00eda Topolansky - in their modest home on the outskirts of Montevideo, with no domestic help and little security. This combined with the fact that he always dressed casually, that he was often seen driving his light blue 1987 Volkswagen Beetle and gave away a large portion of his salary, led some media outlets to call him \"the world's poorest president\". But Mujica always rejected that title: \"They say I'm the poorest president. No, I'm not,\" he told me in a 2012 interview at his home. \"Poor are those who want more [...] because they're in an endless race.\" Despite Mujica preaching austerity, his government did significantly increase public spending, widening the fiscal deficit and leading his opponents to accuse him of waste. Mujica was also criticised for failing to reverse the growing problems in Uruguayan education, despite having promised that education would be a top priority for his administration. However, unlike other leaders in the region, he was never accused of corruption or of undermining his country's democracy. By the end of his administration, Mujica had a high domestic popularity rating (close to 70%) and was elected senator, but also spent part of his time travelling the world after he stepped down as president. \"So what it is that catches the world's attention? That I live with very little, a simple house, that I drive around in an old car? Then this world is crazy because it's surprised by [what is] normal,\" he reflected before leaving office.\n\nGetty Images Mujica's political heir, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, was elected president of Uruguay in November",

    "body": "C\u00e9line Dion sends message to Eurovision as favourites Sweden qualify\n\n22 hours ago Share Save Mark Savage Share Save\n\nEBU C\u00e9line Dion filmed a message to mark Eurovision returning to Switzerland for the first time since she won the 1988 contest\n\nC\u00e9line Dion made a rare appearance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest with a brief, pre-recorded message. The star won the contest for Switzerland in 1988, and it had been rumoured she would take the stage as the ceremony returns to the country this year. \"I'd love nothing more than to be with you,\" she said in a video, apparently ruling out that possibility. \"Switzerland will forever hold a special place in my heart. It's the country that believed in me and gave me the chance to be part of something so extraordinary.\" The semi-final saw 10 acts qualify for Saturday's grand finale, including Swedish entrants KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is the runaway favourite.\n\nSarah Louise Bennett KAJ - whose name is an acrostic for their first names, Kevin, Axel and Jakob - are favourites to win the 2025 contest\n\nTheir song, an accordion-led comedy number whose title translates to \"let's take a sauna\", has a 40% chance of winning, according to bookmakers. If the prediction comes true, it would be Sweden's eighth Eurovision title - making them the most victorious country in the contest's history (they are currently tied with Ireland, on seven wins each). Fifteen acts performed at Tuesday's semi-final in Basel's St Jakobshalle. These are the ones who made the cut. Norway: Kyle Alessandro \u2013 Lighter\n\nAlbania: Shkodra Elektronike \u2013 Zjerm\n\nSweden: KAJ \u2013 Bara Bada Bastu\n\nIceland: V\u00c6B \u2013 R\u00d3A\n\nNetherlands: Claude \u2013 C'est La Vie\n\nPoland: Justyna Steczkowska \u2013 GAJA\n\nSan Marino: Gabry Ponte \u2013 Tutta L'Italia\n\nEstonia: Tommy Cash \u2013 Espresso Macchiato\n\nPortugal: NAPA \u2013 Deslocado\n\nUkraine: Ziferblat \u2013 Bird of Pray That means that the Eurovision dreams of Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia and Slovenia have all ended for 2025. Of those, the biggest surprise was Belgium's Red Sebastian, whose rave anthem Strobe Lights had been predicted to finish among the top five. His disqualification came on the day of his 26th birthday. Ten more acts will progress to the main competition after Thursday's second semi-final. The \"Big Five\" countries, who contribute the most financially to the competition (France, Germany, Spain, the UK and Italy) qualify automatically, as do last year's winners, Switzerland.\n\nGetty Images Celine Dion represented Switzerland at the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin, where she beat the UK entrant, Scott Fitzgerald, by one point\n\nDion's video message came during the ceremony's interval, as votes were being cast. Although she was unable to be there in person, it was a coup for organisers. The singer has stepped away from the limelight in recent years due to health issues related to stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a neurological condition that causes muscle spasms and makes it difficult for her to walk. After a four-year break, she made an emotional comeback at last summer's Paris Olympics, singing Edith Piaf's classic Hymne \u00e0 l'Amour from the Eiffel Tower. Speculation over a potential Eurovision appearance has been mounting since Swiss singer Nemo won the 2024 contest. In her video, Dion said it was \"beautiful and emotional\" to see the young singer lift the trophy, and recalled that her victory in 1988 \"was a life-changing moment for me\". \"To the people of Switzerland, thank you for your love,\" she continued. \"This night is yours and I hope you feel as proud as I do.\" After repeating her message in French, several former Eurovision contestants appeared on stage to cover Dion's winning song from 1988, Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi (Don't Leave Without Me). However, organisers said they had not given up hope of the star appearing at the final this weekend. \"We are still in close contact with her,\" they said in a statement.\n\nGetty Images Polish star Justyna Steczkowska floated above the stage during her performance\n\nTuesday's semi-final opened with Icelandic group V\u00c6B, two brothers with the unregulated energy of former Irish entrants Jedward. They were followed by Polish star Justyna Steczkowska, who hung precariously above the stage on two ropes, as she sang her witchy hymn to mother earth, Gaja. The acrobatics continued with Slovenian musician Klemen, who was suspended upside down during his ballad How Much Time Do We Have Left? The song was a tribute to his wife, who has recently recovered from cancer, but the emotional performance wasn't enough to clinch him a position in the final. Taking a lighter note was Estonia's Tommy Cash, whose quirky anthem Espresso Macchiato was interrupted by a \"stage invader\" - actually a dancer who replicated his noodle-limbed dance moves.\n\nCorinne Cumming Tommy Cash danced with a \"stage invader\" fan before security guards pulled her away\n\nThe arena was awash with Ukranian flags for Ziferblat, whose prog-pop anthem Bird Of Pray is a message of hope and resilience to families separated by the country's ongoing war with Russia. Italy's Lucio Corsi brought 70s glam rock vibes with his track Volevo Esse Un Duro, which even featured a visual call-back to David Bowie and Mick Ronson's iconic 1972 performance of Starman on Top Of The Pops. Croatia's singer Marko Bo\u0161njak was all black eyeliner and sinister energy for his kill-your-enemies anthem Poison Cake, while Dutch singer Claude took the opposite approach, brimming with positivity throughout his upbeat performance of C'est La Vie. And Swiss singer Zo\u00eb M\u00eb was bathed in a sea of mobile phone lights as she performed Voyage , an understated and rather beautiful plea for kindness and understanding.\n\nSarah Louise Bennett Italy's Lucio Corsi (left) recreated David Bowie's iconic Top Of The Pops performance with Mick Ronson during his song, Volevo Essere Un Duro",

    "body": "Biden aide hits back at book alleging cover-up of his 'deterioration'\n\n18 hours ago Share Save Brandon Drenon BBC News, Washington DC Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nJoe Biden's aides have hit back at a new book that accuses a White House inner circle of covering up the former US president's \"physical deterioration\" during his ill-fated re-election campaign. According to the book, Original Sin, Biden's condition during his 2024 presidential run was said to be so poor that aides discussed putting him in a wheelchair. A spokesperson for Biden, 82, said \"evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity\" and maintained the Democrat had been \"a very effective president\". The book, by CNN's Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of Axios, is due to be released on 20 May.\n\nBiden abruptly ended his re-election campaign last July shortly after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump, a Republican. Party insiders blamed him for exiting the race too late, leaving his replacement, Vice-President Kamala Harris, 107 days to challenge Trump, who swept to victory. Ahead of the book's release, Biden last week gave his first interview since leaving the White House to the BBC, saying: \"I don't think it would have mattered\" if he had left the race sooner.\n\nBiden: Withdrawing from 2024 race earlier \"wouldn't have mattered\"\n\nWhile the book largely cites anonymous sources in interviews with more than 200 people, one of the few to be quoted on the record is David Plouffe, who worked on Vice-President Harris's campaign. \"We got so screwed by Biden as a party,\" the book quotes Plouffe as saying. The authors write: \"Biden's physical deterioration - most apparent in his halting walk - had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election. \"Given Biden's age, [his physician Kevin O'Connor] also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,\" the book adds. Biden's physical condition had declined so much, the authors said, that aides had sought to ensure he walked shorter distances, used handrails when mounting stairs, and wore trainers more often.\n\nWatch: Harris speaks about the courage of American people\n\nAt the time, Biden aides repeatedly told reporters his altered gait was due to a foot fracture in November 2020 and his subsequent refusal to consistently wear his prescribed surgical boot. In a statement to Axios, an anonymous Biden aide said: \"Yes, there were physical changes as he got older, but evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.\" The spokesperson added: \"We are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline. \"In fact, the evidence points to the opposite - he was a very effective president.\" Tapper and Thompson's book also says that Biden did not recognise George Clooney at a star-studded California campaign fundraiser last June hosted by the Hollywood star. \"Thank you for being here,\" Biden told Clooney at the event, apparently unaware he was speaking to the Academy Award winner. \"You know George,\" an aide reportedly told Biden, as he was struggled to work out Clooney's identity. Not long after the incident, Clooney wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times calling on Biden to quit the race. The actor was one of the first major donors to publicly withdraw his support. The book also alleges that Biden forgot the names of veteran aides, including trusted loyalist Mike Donilon, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.",

    "body": "Tearful Casandra Ventura tells court Diddy beat and humiliated her\n\n18 hours ago Share Save Madeline Halpert BBC News Reporting from New York court Share Save\n\nWatch: Cassie details violent relationship with Diddy at trial\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs' ex-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, has told the hip-hop mogul's sex-trafficking trial that he controlled her life and coerced her into \"humiliating\" sex acts. The prosecution's star witness testified about the alleged physical and emotional abuse she endured at the hands of the rapper during so-called \"freak-offs\", or sexual encounters the couple had with male escorts. Family and friends have come to court in large numbers to support Mr Combs, whose legal team has not yet questioned Ms Ventura. Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.\n\nWarning: This story contains details that some readers may find distressing.\n\nReuters/Jane Rosenberg\n\nMs Ventura fell 'in love' with Mr Combs\n\nProsecutors began by questioning Ms Ventura - one of their two central witnesses in the case - about her 11-year, on-and-off relationship with Mr Combs. Now 38 and pregnant with her third child, she met Mr Combs when she was a 19-year-old aspiring singer and he was 37. His record label would later sign Ms Ventura as an artist, and shortly afterwards their romantic relationship began. At the time, she testified, she felt like they were in a monogamous relationship, though she knows now that he had other girlfriends. She said she \"fell in love\" with the \"larger-than-life entrepreneur and musician\". But it was not long before she noticed another side to him, she said.\n\nREUTERS/Jane Rosenberg\n\nMr Combs wanted to 'control' every part of her life, Ms Ventura says\n\nMr Combs wanted to \"control\" her life, Ms Ventura said. She said he paid for her home, her cars, her phone and other technology that he would sometimes take away to \"punish\" her. \"Control was everything, from the way that I looked... to what I was working on,\" Ms Ventura said. Eventually, she claimed, the control turned violent. Mr Combs would \"bash on my head, knock me over, drag me and kick me\" frequently, Ms Ventura testified, sometimes through tears. She alleged that she was left with swollen lips, black eyes and knots on her forehead.\n\nMs Ventura felt 'humiliated' by 'freak-offs'\n\nProsecutors spent hours on Tuesday asking Ms Ventura about so-called \"freak-offs\". Ms Ventura told the court how Mr Combs introduced her to the sexual events during the first year of their relationship. They would hire a male escort or stripper to have sex with Ms Ventura while Mr Combs watched. Ms Ventura told the court that she first tried the encounters to make Mr Combs \"happy\". But she said they humiliated her, and sometimes lasted three to four days. \"I felt pretty horrible about myself,\" she told the court, wiping away tears. \"It made me feel worthless.\" Ms Ventura told the court she never wanted to have sex with anyone but Mr Combs, and claimed she would take myriad drugs - marijuana, ecstasy and ketamine - to help her perform to Mr Combs' satisfaction, but also to \"disassociate\". The drugs were \"a way to not feel it for what it really was\", she said, \"having sex with a stranger I didn't really want to be having sex with\".\n\nMr Combs flew male escorts in for freak-offs, court hears\n\nAs prosecutors pressed Ms Ventura about the \"freak-offs\", she told the court of how Mr Combs would direct her to find male escorts, strippers or dancers to have sex with while he watched. She alleged that Mr Combs would pay the men anywhere from $1,500 to $6,000 in cash, depending on their performance. They found the men through stripper companies and sites like Craigslist. Some of their photos were displayed to the jurors, including Daniel Phillip, who finished his testimony earlier on Tuesday. Ms Ventura and Mr Combs had the enounters in cities around the world, including Los Angeles, New York, Las Vegas and Ibiza, Spain, Ms Ventura testified. Sometimes, men would be flown in during vacations, she alleged, and Mr Combs would direct her to ask staff to pay for and arrange their travel, calling them new employees. Among other charges, prosecutors are trying to prove that Mr Combs engaged in sex trafficking - human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation - and transportation to engage in prostitution.\n\nMr Combs 'directed', Ms Ventura says\n\nAs prosecutors pressed Ms Ventura for graphic details, one key element emerged: Ms Ventura claimed that Mr Combs controlled every part of the encounters. He chose the outfits she wore - down to the extremely high heels she kept on for hours - as well as the sexual acts that transpired and the lighting, Ms Ventura told jurors. \"If Sean wanted something to happen, that was what was going to happen,\" she said. \"I couldn't say no.\" Sometimes, Ms Ventura said, she would take the lead on which male escorts to hire because Mr Combs was \"very busy\", but she only did so at his direction, she said. She said freak-offs had a very specific \"pattern\" of sexual acts each time. \"He was controlling the whole situation,\" she alleged. \"He was directing it.\" At times, Ms Ventura said, she tried to tell Mr Combs that she felt \"horrible\". But when he dismissed her concerns, she said, she relented, worried he would get angry or question their relationship. Ms Ventura is expected to continue her testimony on Wednesday, when she could also face cross-examination.",

University of Oxford scientists, working with a local team in the Budongo Forest, filmed and recorded incidents of the animals using plants for first aid, both on themselves and occasionally on each other. Their research builds on the discovery last year that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate. The scientists also compiled decades of scientific observations to create a catalogue of the different ways in which chimpanzees use \"forest first aid\".\n\nElodie Freymann Chimpanzees are some of our closest primate relatives\n\nResearchers say the study, which is published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, adds to a growing body of evidence that primates, including chimps, orangutans and gorillas, use natural medicines in a number of ways to stay healthy in the wild. Chimpanzees \u2018self-medicate\u2019 with healing plants\n\nWounded orangutan seen using plant as medicine Lead researcher Elodie Freymann explained there was \"a whole behavioural repertoire that chimpanzees use when they're sick or injured in the wild - to treat themselves and to maintain hygiene\". \"Some of these include the use of plants that can be found here,\" she explained. \"The chimpanzees dab them on their wounds or chew the plants up, and then apply the chewed material to the open injury.\" The researchers studied footage of a very young, female chimpanzee chewing plant material and applying it to an injury on its mother's body. They also found records of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of other animals they weren't related to. This is particularly exciting, explained Dr Freymann, \"because it adds to the evidence that wild chimpanzees have the capacity for empathy\".\n\nSome of the hundreds of written observations that Dr Freymann and her colleagues studied came from a log book at the field station in the forest site, which is northwest of the capital, Kampala. This record of anecdotal evidence dates back to the 1990s \u2013 local field staff, researchers and visitors have written in, describing any interesting behaviour they have observed. There are stories in that book of leaf-dabbing on injuries and chimps helping other chimps to remove snares from their limbs. There are some surprisingly human-like hygiene habits: One note describes a chimpanzee using leaves to wipe itself after defecating. This team of researchers has previously identified some of the plants that chimpanzees sought out and ate when they were injured. The scientists took samples of those plants, tested them and discovered most had antibacterial properties.\n\nElodie Freymann Researcher Dr Elodie Freymann follows and observes wild chimpanzees to record their natural behaviour",

The new cabinet of 28 ministers and 10 secretaries of state heralds some significant changes, including a new foreign minister to handle the US-Canada relationship. The reshuffle, two weeks after the election, brings some familiar names as well as political newcomers - a team \"purpose-built for this hinge moment\", Carney told reporters. There are 24 new faces in cabinet, including 13 first-time MPs. Several veterans of former PM Justin Trudeau's government, such as Melanie Joly and Chrystia Freeland, return to cabinet.\n\nOther holdovers from the Trudeau era include Anita Anand, Gary Anandasangaree, Sean Fraser and Dominic LeBlanc. But housing, immigration and energy - key departments for which the Trudeau government was heavily criticised - have been given to first-time ministers. Carney is also continuing Trudeau's policy of maintaining gender parity in his cabinet.\n\nA new US-Canada team\n\n\"Canada's new ministry is built to deliver the change Canadians want and deserve,\" Carney said on Tuesday. He has made a number of changes to the core team of ministers handling the strained relationship with the US. It comes after Carney recently met Trump at the White House, after which he said the US leader was willing to negotiate a new trade deal. Veteran member of parliament (MP), Dominic LeBlanc, who has overseen a number of cabinet positions, most recently international trade, will now focus on Canada-US trade and breaking down internal trade barriers within the country - a key campaign pledge. Toronto-area MP Maninder Sidhu, takes over as minister of international trade. Carney has also named a new foreign minister, Anita Anand, who held a number of top roles in Trudeau's cabinet, including defence. Melanie Joly was shuffled out of foreign affairs and given the industry portfolio. Former justice minister Gary Anandasangaree now takes on the role of public safety, a department that will oversee border security, which Trump has cited as a key reason for imposing tariffs on Canada as well as Mexico. David McGuinty, who previously held that position, now oversees defence. Two prominent names have been pushed out of the cabinet - Bill Blair, who oversaw defence, and Jonathan Wilkinson, natural resources minister. Rookie MP Tim Hodgson, first elected in April, is taking over at natural resources.

    "title": "The heartbeat of a billion: What Virat Kohli meant to India",
    "body": "The heartbeat of a billion: What Virat Kohli meant to India\n\n21 hours ago Share Save Ayaz Memon Cricket writer Share Save\n\nWatch: India's Virat Kohli: A modern-day great in Test cricket\n\nVirat Kohli's retirement from Tests has left Indian cricket beleaguered and the sporting world gasping in surprise. Coming on the heels of captain Rohit Sharma quitting a few days earlier, it adds up to a double whammy for India who embark on a tough tour of England for a five-Test series come June without their two most experienced batters. Like Sharma, Kohli took to Instagram, where he commands more than 270 million followers, to make his retirement public. \"As I step away from this format, it's not easy \u2013 but it feels right\u2026'' he explained to his disconsolate fans. Tributes for Kohli have come in a deluge since: from fellow cricketers, past and present, old and young, and also legends from other disciplines like tennis ace Novak Djokovic and football star Harry Kane, which highlights the sweep and heft of Kohli's global appeal. Leading India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Kohli was fast tracked into international cricket by the then-chairman of selectors, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, against the judgement of others in the cricket establishment. \"Many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket, and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him,\" recalls Vengsarkar. An example of Kohli's obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy. Kohli was playing his second Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. His father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis. After the funeral, he went back and scored a battling 90.\n\nGetty Images Kohli bows out of Test cricket as one of the defining players of his generation\n\nVengsarkar's approving eye earned Kohli an ODI debut in 2009. At 23, he was the youngest member of India's 2011 ODI World Cup winning team under MS Dhoni. A few weeks later, he made his Test debut in the West Indies. Some months on, during the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat, Kohli made a gritty maiden century and never looked back. Within a couple of years he established himself as the pre-eminent batter of his generation. Brash and provocative, without a benign muscle in his body, he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years. He was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents, often indulging in on-field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism. Happily, this was not to become his defining identity in cricket. Prolific run-getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle. When his idol Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, Kohli, allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills, grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history. He wielded the bat like a Jedi, with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents, as it were. Coupled with his high-octane persona, his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box-office returns everywhere he played. Kohli always wore his passion on his sleeve. He was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time, misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights. Marriage to film star Anushka Sharma made them the country's foremost power couple, putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight. Metaphorically, Kohli's outstanding exploits, especially in the first decade of his career, epitomised the emerging India of the 21st century: unabashedly, unrelentingly ambitious, discarding all past demons, willing to take on the best in the world. His achievements across formats are monumental. In ODIs, he is third in run aggregate behind Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakarra, but boasts the best average (57.88) among batters who have played more than 100 games. His ability to win ODI matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore, many of his record 51 centuries coming in such pursuit.\n\nGetty Images Kohli led the Indian team to victory in 2018-2019 Test series against Australia\n\nIn T20s, his run aggregate and centuries don't put him in the top five, but he's immortalised himself with incredible knocks, notably 82 not out in an emotion-charged, pulsating match against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2022 World Cup and a vital 76 in the 2024 final against South Africa, which helped India win the title. He is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League. At one point, Kohli averaged 50-plus in all three formats, making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era - way ahead of contemporaries Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. The four were locked in a fascinating, long-running race for batting supremacy. When it appeared he would break all batting records, Kohli's career took an inexplicable downturn. From the start of the pandemic, the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle. In his pomp \u2013 between 2014 and 2019 \u2013 he had been unstoppable, at one time scoring six double centuries in just 18 months. The drought of runs hit him most adversely in Test cricket where his average, from a high of 55-plus in 2019 slumped to the current 46.75. In this period, Kohli also lost the captaincy, though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched. Kohli finishes his Test career with 9,230 runs, which puts him 19th overall in aggregate, and fourth among Indians behind Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar, all of whom finished with a 50-plus average and more centuries. But to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format . As captain, Kohli easily hurdles over Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. In Test cricket, winning 40 of the 68 matches he led in, making him the fourth most successful in the format. In the Indian context, this assumes Himalayan proportions.

    "title": "William Ruto's nicknames: Why Kenya's president is known as Kasongo, prophet and hustler",
    "body": "El Chapo & Deputy Jesus - why Kenya's president has so many nicknames\n\n20 hours ago Share Save Basillioh Rukanga BBC News, Nairobi Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nKenya's President William Ruto is a man of many nicknames. El Chapo, Kasongo, Hustler, Deputy Jesus and Chicken Seller are just some that he has acquired in recent years. As is often the case when people are given alternative monikers, some are affectionate but some are intended to mock, while others reflect a profound anger. A history of the president's aliases offer a window into how the perception of him has changed. Ruto has acknowledged the rechristening trend, joking recently that Kenyans are \"finishing\" him with the numerous labels. \"You have given me so many names. I had the name William Kipchirchir Samoei Ruto. You added Survivor\u2026 Zakayo... now you are at Kasongo [the title of a Congolese song about abandonment and heartbreak]. Will you stop at 10, or should I prepare for more?\" he recently asked. The crowd, at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, responded that they had even more. Before he was elected president in 2022, Ruto attracted handles that bolstered his reputation as a man of the people. Hustler - Kenyan parlance for someone eking out a living against the odds - helped portray him as someone who would prioritise the needs of the struggling folk. Chicken Seller, referring to his childhood when he hawked poultry on the roadside, resonated with many who saw his life as an epitome of their own. \"These were very positive [names]. They sold him to the public in terms of votes,\" political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC, arguing that they helped catapult him into the top job. \"Names really stick with Ruto,\" he added.\n\nAFP / Getty Images Ruto gained a reputation among Kenyans struggling to get by that he understood their plight\n\nBut the president has been a high-profile figure in Kenyan politics for a long time, including serving as deputy president for nine years until 2022, and has never been far from controversy. Prof Manyora recalls the label Arap Mashamba \u2013 which translates as \"son of farms\" \u2013 coined just under a decade ago and relates to Ruto's ownership of vast tracts of land across the country. Concerns have been raised about how some of these have been acquired. In 2013, a court ordered Ruto to surrender a 100-acre (40-hectare) farm and compensate a farmer who had accused him of grabbing it during the 2007 post-election violence. He denied any wrongdoing. Ruto's penchant for quoting Bible verses also earned him the Deputy Jesus tag. He has also been given the name Nabii, or prophet. However, it is since his rise to the presidency that the nickname manufacturers have been working overtime \u2013 with at least a dozen being created - and they have become increasingly critical. One that has stood out is Zakayo - Swahili for the name Zaccheaus, a Biblical figure who is portrayed as a greedy tax collector who climbed a tree to see Jesus. The \u2018tax collector\u2019 president sparking Kenyan anger\n\nBBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters Ruto's government introduced a raft of unpopular taxes and many Kenyans began to say that he had betrayed the \"hustlers\". \"He failed to deliver after becoming president,\" Prof Manyora said. The pain of paying more taxes, and a perception that the extra money will be wasted, is the focus of many conversations. Last year, young people came out onto the streets of Nairobi for weeks of protests, which turned deadly, against a fresh government proposal to raise taxes that was later dropped.\n\nAnadolu / Getty Images Last year's anti-tax protests galvanised young people angry at the government over the state of the economy\n\nThe chant \"Ruto must go\" became a rallying call for the demonstrators and now Must Go has become another way to refer to the leader. The creative christeners have also focussed on the allegation that the president enjoys foreign travel. Hence the title Vasco da Ganya \u2013 a play on the name of the 15th Century Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, and the Swahili word danganya, which means \"to lie\". Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire Ruto's honesty has also been called into question with Kaunda Uongoman, which mimics late Congolese musician Kanda Bongoman. The first part refers to the president's love for the Kaunda suit - a safari jacket with matching trousers \u2013 and Uongoman, which incorporates the Swahili word uongo, meaning \"lies\". But the president seems impervious to this volley of verbal attacks. Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the manifold nicknames \"don't raise concerns\" in the office of the president but simply \"capture how people view a person\". Ruto is \"very hands-on and doing his best to transform the economy... It's normal for any leader to have many nicknames as this signifies his various attributes and initiatives as a leader\", he told the BBC. Mwaura also argued that the government has had to raise taxes to pay for new projects, reduce the budget deficit and fix the economy. Nevertheless, when people have gone beyond inventing new names and used satire and forms of art to ridicule the president, there has been a negative reaction from officials. Some cartoons and AI-generated images, including showing the president in a casket, have been described as \"reckless\" and \"distasteful\". Some of the alleged producers of this online content have been victims of abductions. This, Prof Manyora said, should be seen as a sign of intolerance by the government. Lachon Kiplimo, a 23-year-old university student, said that while he supported the president, some of the promises he has made have been \"unrealistic\", which fuels the nicknames. He cited the use of El Chapo, referring to the former Mexican drug lord, after Ruto promised a machine that would produce a million chapatis (also known as chapo in Kenya) every day to feed schoolchildren in the capital.\n\nAFP / Getty Images A chapati - a popular street food in Kenya - is also known as a chapo\n\nMr Kiplimo however reckons that the way the president brushes off the monikers, and in fact seems to embrace them, shows how strong he is. Prof Manyora believes the young people who come up with the alternative labels for the president do it as a form of catharsis, a way of releasing tension. This view is backed up by 24-year-old student Margaret Wairimu Kahura, who said that many Kenyans \"are in a lot of pain\". She feels that the mockery is a way of letting Ruto know how the youth are feeling. She says that no other Kenyan president has been subjected to this level of lampooning, and \"so this is unique [but] in a bad way\". It is true that previous heads of state had nicknames but they have not been so numerous. The last President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was called Kamwana (\"young boy\"), Jayden (a Kenyan reference to a pampered or lazy child) and Wamashati (for his love of print shirts). His predecessor, Mwai Kibaki, was known as General Kiguoya (a general who is afraid) and Fence Sitter. Perhaps the age of social media, with its insatiable appetite for new content to keep people amused, has increased the trend towards name calling. But for many, like Ms Kahura, the volume of nicknames for Ruto are a genuine reflection of \"the different problems that people are facing\".\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

    "title": "India-Pakistan conflict: How real is the risk of nuclear war?",
    "body": "How real is the risk of nuclear war between India and Pakistan?\n\n20 hours ago Share Save Soutik Biswas \u2022 @soutikBBC India correspondent Share Save\n\nCorbis via Getty Images India's nuclear capable Agni-5 missile has a range of over 5,000km\n\nIn the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons. Yet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre. Even scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan. Six years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be. As the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral. President Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats. \"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added. India and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons. The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US. \"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC. One reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability. Since testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine. India, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions. Further ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)\n\nAFP via Getty Images Pakistan's surface-to-surface Shaheen II missile is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead\n\nThe absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Pakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation. In 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake. In his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India. Around the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\" During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Indian soldiers patrolling the edge of a crater, the site of the May 1998 underground nuclear test\n\nBut there is scepticism on both sides over such claims. Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts. \"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC. But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC. In March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".) Yet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary. \"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said. \"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)\n\nAFP via Getty Images The Chagai Hills, whitened at the top after Pakistan's nuclear tests in May 1998, in south-western Balochistan",

    "body": "Trump touts 'record' Boeing-Qatar Airways deal\n\n10 minutes ago Share Save Natalie Sherman BBC News Share Save\n\nBloomberg/Getty\n\nQatar Airways has agreed to buy up to 210 jets from American manufacturing giant Boeing, according to US President Donald Trump, who announced the $96bn order as part of his tour of the Middle East. The White House said the deal would support 154,000 jobs in the US each year of production and marked the largest-ever order of 787 Dreamliners, a wide-body jet used for longer flights. Qatar Airways and Boeing later confirmed the agreement. It is the second deal involving Boeing to be announced as part of Trump's trip, marking a win for the company as it tries to rebuild its business after a series of manufacturing and safety issues.\n\nThe blow-out of a panel on one of its planes in January 2024 forced a dramatic slowdown in its manufacturing operations and sparked a more than $10bn loss last year. But shares in the company, which was also hurt by a seven-week strike by some of its workers, have climbed roughly 20% since January, an indication of increased optimism about the firm's prospects. Boss Kelly Ortberg told investors in April that the firm's recovery plan was in \"full swing\" after the firm delivered a greater-than-expected 130 aircraft in the first three months of the year. Executives said the firm still had a backlog of 5,600 planes, amounting to more than seven years of production.\n\nThe Qatar Airways deal, which includes 130 Dreamliners, 30 777-9s and the option for 50 other planes, was part of more than $240bn in \"economic deals\" between the US and Qatar that the White House announced as part of the trip. It would deepen a longstanding relationship between Boeing and the state-owned airline, which already had 150 Boeing airplanes in its fleet and more than 130 jets on order, according to Boeing's website. \"It's the largest order of jets in the history of Boeing, that's good,\" Trump said at the signing \"So that's a record, Kelly, and congratulations to Boeing. Get those planes out there, get them out there.\" As part of Trump's trip, Boeing had previously announced it had won a commitment from Saudia Arabia's Avilease, which leases planes to airlines, to buy 20 737 MAX planes, with options for 10 more. British Airways owner IAG also said earlier this month that it had placed an order for 32 787-10 aircraft worth $13bn, a deal Trump previewed as part of his US-UK trade announcement. Those are set to start being delivered in 2028. The trade truce between the US and China has also helped to ease a challenge for the firm, whose customers in China had stopped accepting planes as tariffs escalated.",

It said there was \"no such thing as a veto on Chinese investment\" in the deal. The UK-US agreement rowed back on big hikes in tariffs on metals and cars imposed by President Donald Trump, but it also included conditions requiring the UK to \"promptly meet\" US demands on the \"security of the supply chains\" of steel and aluminium products exported to America. Beijing fears this could see it being excluded from supplying US-bound goods to the UK, telling the Financial Times it was a \"basic principle\" that bilateral trade deals should not target other countries.\n\nAt a regular press conference on Tuesday China's foreign ministry spokesperson was asked about the UK's trade agreements with the US and India. Lin Jian said: \"As for the trade agreement... between the UK and relevant countries, I would like to point out that cooperation between countries should not target or harm the interests of third parties.\"\n\nChina is the world's second biggest economy and the UK's fifth biggest trading partner. In 2024 total bilateral trade hit \u00a398.4bn. In response to the latest comments from China, the UK government said the agreement with the US was \"in the national interest to secure thousands of jobs across key sectors, protect British businesses and lay the groundwork for greater trade in the future\". Any \"external provisions\" in the agreement were \"not designed to undermine mutually beneficial economic relations with any third country\", it said. \"As the Chief Secretary to the Treasury clearly stated, there is no such thing as a veto on Chinese investment in this trade deal.\" It added that \"trade and investment with China remain important to the UK.\"\n\nUnder the UK-US deal Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world still applies to most UK goods entering the US. But the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including steel and aluminium.

    "body": "Burberry to cut 1,700 jobs as designer suffers heavy losses\n\n8 hours ago Share Save Charlotte Edwards \u2022 @EdwardsCLM Business reporter, BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nLuxury fashion firm Burberry has said it could cut some 1,700 jobs as part of plans to reduce costs by 2027. The British designer brand - famed for its distinctive camel, red and black check pattern - announced the proposed savings on Wednesday as it reported a \u00a366m loss in the last financial year. The proposed job cuts would reduce its global workforce by almost a fifth and include potential redundancies at its Castleford factory in West Yorkshire. Burberry chief executive Joshua Schulman said the majority of job losses would come from its head office teams around the world, but said the cuts would \"naturally\" be focused in the UK, where most of its staff are based.\n\nHe confirmed staff rotas would be reorganised and that night shifts at its factory in Castleford, which makes trench coats priced from \u00a31,000 to \u00a310,000 each, would be scrapped. \"For a long time we have had overcapacity at that facility, and that is simply not sustainable,\" Mr Schulman said. \"But I want to be very clear that we are making this change to safeguard our UK manufacturing, and in fact we will be making a significant investment to renovate this factory in the second half.\"\n\nBurberry said it would align \"schedules with peak store traffic\" in its shops, which would result in the reduction of some jobs. It added savings would also come from \"operating expenses, with increased efficiency of spend in procurement and real estate\". The company said the cuts were \"subject to consultation where applicable\". Burberry was founded in 1856 and has been making its famous raincoats in Yorkshire since 1972. The designer brand previously announced \u00a340m cost-savings programme in November, meaning it now plans to create the combined annualised savings of \u00a3100m by Spring 2027. \"The continued resilience of our outerwear and scarf categories reaffirms my belief that we have the most opportunity where we have the most authenticity,\" said Mr Schulman, who was appointed chief executive in July last year. \"While we are operating against a difficult macroeconomic backdrop and are still in the early stages of our turnaround, I am more optimistic than ever that Burberry's best days are ahead,\" he added.\n\n'Pretty radical steps'",

    "title": "Is the US finally on track to build a high-speed rail network?",
    "body": "Is the US finally on track to build a high-speed rail network?\n\n21 hours ago Share Save Sam Gruet & Megan Lawton Business reporters Share Save\n\nGetty Images Amtrak's new high-speed trains will be held back by tracks that greatly limit how quickly they can move\n\nThe US is a country of 340 million people, 71 interstate highways, more than 5,000 public airports, and currently no high-speed railways. Yet with two high-speed rail (HSR) projects now under construction, and others planned, is the US finally on track to start catching up with the fast trains seen in China, Japan and Europe? Rick Harnish, of US campaign group High Speed Rail Alliance, says it is at least good to see the first two schemes being built. \"The first is the San Francisco to Los Angeles route,\" he explains. \"That's an incredibly challenging route to build because of the mountains in California. \"Then there's Las Vegas to Los Angeles, a relatively easy project to build, as it is flat land.\" In addition, there are plans for a HSR line from Portland in Oregon to Seattle in Washington State, and onto Vancouver in Canada. And another between Dallas and Houston. Yet Mr Harnish warns that planning efforts for the former are \"moving slowly\", while the Texas line is now more doubtful after President Trump's government cancelled a $63.9m (\u00a348m) grant.\n\nBy marked contrast, the total length of China's HSR network will reportedly exceed 50,000 km (31,000 miles) this year. Meanwhile, the European Union has 8,556 km of HSR lines, led by Spain's 3,190 km. In the UK, the only current HSR line is High Speed 1, the 68 miles link between the Channel Tunnel and London St Pancras. But High Speed 2 continues to be constructed from London Euston to Birmingham, despite well-publicised funding issues. While there is no universally agreed definition on what constitutes HSR, global railways trade group International Union of Railways says that trains generally need to be moving at more than 250 km/h (155 mph). So why does US lag behind Europe and especially China? \"We're a very car-addicted nation,\" says American rail industry journalist and author Will Doig. \"There's lots of people who just don't think we need it, or don't really want it coming through their area. \"And the US government has really shown a willingness to shut down investment in a lot of projects, especially rail.\"\n\nGetty Images Two high-speed rail lines are currently under construction in the US, in California and Nevada\n\nFurther complicating the situation in the US is that the boss of the government-owned passenger train service Amtrak, Stephen Gardner, resigned last month. It was widely reported that he stood down after pressure from the White House. Amtrak currently does not operate any HSR trains. Later this year it is due to enter 28 new 160mph NextGen Acela trains into service on its Northeast Corridor route between Boston and Washington DC. However, only around 50 miles of the 457-mile line can presently allow trains to travel at more than 150mph. Amtrak is not involved in the high-speed lines being built in California and Nevada. The LA to San Francisco project, called California High-Speed Rail, is being led by the state of California, and due to be completed by 2033. The line from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Brightline West, is a privately-run project. It is expected to open in 2028.\n\nGlobally, there are 23 nations with HSR, according to Mr Harnish. His non-profit organisation has the sole mission of bringing it to the US. Allowing HSR trains to run safely is far from straightforward, he adds. \"You can't have any crossings with highways, it needs to be very straight and a sealed corridor.\" In China the country is still building more and more HSR lines, with the total distance expected to reach around 60,000km by 2030. Chinese cities that get HSR links see their economies increase by 14.2%, according to data from Denmark-based think tank 21st Europe. Chinese firms are also helping to build HSR systems in other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Will Doig, who wrote a book called High-Speed Empire, Chinese Expansion, and the Future of Southeast Asia, says that China is not just interested in helping its neighbours improve their rail networks. \"It is a way of China spreading its influence across a region that it felt was geopolitically strategic,\" he says. \"In some of these cases, countries have taken out loans from China so that China can then build the railways.\" He warns that this may put them \"in a position where they're beholden to China\".\n\nGetty Images China's high-speed rail network now dwarfs that in all other countries\n\nEurope's growing HSR network is testament to the continent's history of investing in its public infrastructure, says Kaave Pour from 21st Europe. His think tank is now calling for further expansion of HSR, so that it connects most capitals and main cities in the EU, and those in the UK. Mr Pour says that if the US wants to develop HSR it needs to start with a cultural shift, a move towards more public transport, and asking itself \"what type of future does it want?\". Mr Harnish from the High Speed Rail Alliance says that in order for HSR to work in the US, \"the federal government is an essential component\". Yet as already flagged, the White House has pulled the plug on giving the planned high-speed line between Houston and Dallas a federal grant. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the project as a \"waste of taxpayers' money\".",

    "body": "City charity begins new wellbeing service\n\n14 hours ago Share Save Kate Moser Andon BBC News, Cambridgeshire Share Save\n\nBBC Charis Newman from Family Action said she wanted to create a \"vibrant hub\" in Welland\n\nA city charity has begun a service to boost wellbeing and tackle isolation - but wants local people to tell them what it should offer. Family Action runs a community centre off the Welland housing estate in Peterborough. It is planning a project where local people can request help with anything, but also make suggestions for community events and activities. Charis Newman from Family Action said: \"We want people to come forward and say 'we want this', we really are open to suggestions.\"\n\nThe community centre is also used as a food hub for local families\n\nThe service begins on 4 June with a coffee morning every Wednesday between 09:00 and 12:00. There, people can get advice on \"literally anything\", Ms Newman said, such as writing a CV or filling out forms, or make suggestions on \"what they feel they're missing at the moment\". She said the aim was to involve hard-to-reach families in Welland, which is one of the most deprived areas of the city. \"We've got some work to do in winning over people's trust,\" she said. \"It does feel as though people are a little bit insular, a lot of people felt like it's difficult to connect with people. \"If we just get a few people to start with, then they can see how friendly we all are, and how much we want to help.\"\n\nThe charity is hoping to be able to use the outdoor space outside of pre-school hours\n\nFamily Action already runs a pre-school out of the community centre, and a weekly community fridge. Helen Terrington, from Family Action, said: \"We're sort of hidden away at the back of the houses, so we want to make sure people know we're here.\" She said they were also open to hear from people who could volunteer for the new service. \"We're really interested in hearing what skills the local community have got, if they're really passionate about crafting, crochet, if there's a yoga teacher. \"The possibilities are endless.\"\n\nFollow Peterborough news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "body": "Carrots, death rays and passing ships. This is the origin story of the word radar\n\ntoggle caption JULIEN DE ROSA/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n\nThe nation's aviation infrastructure is again under scrutiny, following a series of paralyzing communications and radar outages at some of the country's busiest airports.\n\nOn Sunday, systems at the Terminal Radar Approach Control facility in Philadelphia, which guides planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport, went blank, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The disruption caused it to lose communication with all of the planes in the sky, meaning air traffic controllers couldn't see or reach pilots for 90 seconds. That prompted the FAA to order a temporary ground stop, triggering flight delays and cancellations.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe incident came just days after a nearly identical technology mishap on April 28, during which controllers lost contact with aircraft for 30 seconds.\n\nWhat has followed has been weeks of chaos and fear over passenger safety, especially months after a fatal midair collision near Ronald Reagan International Airport in Washington, D.C. killed 67 people. The failures have highlighted inadequacies of current radar systems that are supposed to work together to provide air traffic controllers a comprehensive view of all activity on the runways and over airspace.\n\nIn an effort to address some of those worries, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the antiquated telecommunications, radio and surveillance systems. According to the FAA, some airports still rely on systems that use floppy disks and copper wire.\n\nTalk of the broader revamp has spurred conversations about the latest innovations in radar technology. Here is a look at the scientific origins of radar.\n\nWhere did the word come from?\n\nThe word, radar, is a near acronym that stands for RAdio Detection And Ranging. It was coined by the U.S. Navy in either 1940 or 1941, according to the FAA and Merriam-Webster dictionary .\n\nIt works a lot like an echo, but rather than sound waves, pulses of radio waves are emitted that then bounce off of an object. By timing how long it takes for the signal to go out and come back, one can calculate how far away something is. And, depending on the angle of the incoming signal, one can also work out the elevation, speed and trajectory of whatever is out there.\n\ntoggle caption Henry Guttmann Collection/Getty Images/Hulton Archive\n\nThough it seems like thoroughly modern technology, the application dates back to the late 19th century. German physicist Heinrich Hertz was the first to prove that pulsing radio waves are reflected by metallic surfaces. However, credit for the first invention to use what we now think of as radar, belongs to German physicist Christian H\u00fclsmeyer. H\u00fclsmeyer built on Hertz's work to create the Telemobiloskop , an invention patented in 1904. The device contained both a transmitter and receiver and was designed to detect and help passing ships avoid colliding into one another.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut it was the British military that unleashed the true potential of radar technology under pressure from the Germans in the 1930s. World War II was looming and the British were desperate for a weapon to stave off attacks. Their answer: The death ray.\n\nThe British military put their best and brightest on the case, including Robert Watson-Watt, a Scottish physicist.\n\nThe government had had the idea for some time.\n\n\"For 10 years, it had a standing reward of \u00a31,000 to anyone who developed a ray that could kill a sheep at 100 yards,\" Robert Buderi, author of The Invention That Changed the World, told NPR. That's roughly $50,000 in today's money.\n\nWatson-Watt quickly realized such a weapon was out of the realm of possibility but he offered an alternate solution: \"The idea of radio detection as opposed to radio destruction,\" Buderi said.\n\nIt was a huge development.\n\nBy the outbreak of the war in 1939, the government had built a system \u2014 called Chain Home \u2014 that could detect enemy aircraft within a 100 mile range. Historians cite this as a massive turning point in the war, preventing the Nazis from ever landing on British soil.\n\nBuderi noted, even more pivotal to the allied war effort was the top secret invention of a device about the size of a hockey puck, called the cavity magnetron. Developed by two British scientists, it was a powerful transmitter of radio waves that was much more compact and powerful than anything that existed until then.\n\n\"This gave the promise of actually fitting radar systems onto planes themselves,\" Buderi explained.\n\ntoggle caption Topical Press Agency/Getty Images/Hulton Archive\n\nThe U.K. shared the advances with American scientists. That led to the founding of a secret lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called the Radiation Lab to develop microwave radar systems for use during the war.\n\n\"It is frequently said that, although the atomic bomb ended World War II, it was radar that won the war,\" MIT says of the lab's role in the war effort .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHow has radar changed over time?\n\nRadar is a common technology today, even though it was once a highly kept secret.\n\n(In fact, radar was such a highly regarded secret, that in order to cover their success in shooting down enemy bombers with the new technology, they claimed Royal Air Force pilots simply ate lots of carrots. Thus spawning the myth that carrots drastically improve nighttime vision, according to The Smithsonian .)\n\nToday modern aircraft are reliant on radar to avoid midair collisions. That wasn't always the case.\n\nShortly after the war, air travel exploded. Through the early 1950s, a hodgepodge of state and industry agencies controlled what happened within the 158,000 miles of airways over the country.\n\nIt wasn't until mid-1952, after five years of testing by the U.S. Navy, that Washington National Airport became the first in the U.S. to use radar. The FAA says pilots resisted the innovation saying they worried about losing control.\n\nThat all changed after a devastating collision on June 30, 1956, when a United Airlines plane crashed into a TWA flight over the Grand Canyon, killing all 128 passengers and crew from both planes.\n\nAn investigation said the probable cause \"was that the pilots did not see each other in time to avoid the collision.\"\n\nA little more than a year later, President Eisenhower signed the Airways Modernization Act into law, streamlining regulations and practices, and ensuring that planes would now be monitored from take off to landing.\n\nWhy does the word matter today?\n\nThe Department of Transportation's plan to \"equip facilities with better technology to reduce outages, improve efficiency, and reinforce safety\" would mean years of upgrades at airports across the country paid for with billions of taxpayer dollars.\n\n\"We have a system that is built for the past, we are proposing a system built for the future,\" the FAA said in a statement .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAmong the specifics outlined by the agency are new fiber, wireless and satellite technologies at over 4,600 sites, 25,000 new radios and 475 new voice switches. Additionally, the FAA said, it would like to replace 618 radars \"which have gone past their life cycle.\"\n\nDuffy has repeatedly stated that the entire project is doable in under four years. But the Government Accountability Office estimates that a revamp of this scope will take 10 to 13 years to accomplish properly.\n\nThere is also some discrepancy on the cost of such an endeavor. As NPR reported, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has estimated the cost at about $12.5 billion. But aviation industry experts, pilot association representatives and others, put the tally at a minimum of $18.5 billion.\n\nOn a more day to day level, the current problems with today's radar systems will continue to disrupt passenger's flight plans.\n\nSpeaking to NBC's Meet the Press, Duffy said he plans to reduce the number of flights in and out of Newark for the \"next several weeks.\"\n\n\"I want you to get to where you're traveling. And if that means slowing down flights into Newark, we slow them down to make sure we can do it safely,\" Duffy said.\n\n",

Routh has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAt a hearing in federal court here on Wednesday, Routh's defense lawyers argued that two of the charges against him should be dismissed because they violate his Second Amendment rights. Routh is accused of illegally owning a firearm as a convicted felon and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFederal public defender Sonia Fahrezi told U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon that recent court decisions show, \"The Second Amendment doesn't just apply to law-abiding citizens.\" Routh has two prior felony convictions, including one for illegally possessing dynamite. Fahrezi says those convictions should not preclude him from exercising his constitutional right to own a firearm. And she said, \"The absence of a serial number doesn't remove a firearm from the Second Amendment text.\"\n\ntoggle caption Nicolas Garcia/AFP via Getty Images\n\nJustice Department prosecutor John Shipley said the statute that prohibits felons from possessing firearms is still law. And he said, \"A firearm with an obliterated serial number has no lawful purpose.\"\n\nJudge Cannon was appointed by President Trump. She's the same judge who dismissed charges against the president for mishandling classified documents at his home in Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn addition to the felony gun counts, Routh faces three other charges, including attempting to assassinate a presidential candidate.\n\nRouth has been in federal custody since his arrest in September. A Secret Service agent who was part of Trump's security detail says he saw a gun barrel poking from the tree line a few holes ahead of where the then-presidential candidate was golfing. The agent fired at the person holding the gun. A man later identified as Routh fled the scene and was arrested a short time later driving north on Interstate-95.\n\nOn Wednesday, Routh's lawyers asked Judge Cannon to suppress the testimony of the witness who identified their client as the person who was seen running from Trump's golf club.\n\nTwo hours after the incident, the witness, identified in court by his initials, TCM, was flown by helicopter to a location on I-95. Routh's lawyer Renee Sihvola said, he saw from the helicopter the traffic stopped on the interstate, and was taken by car to a location where he was presented with a single suspect, a handcuffed Routh. The defense says that was \"impermissibly suggestive\" and created a \"substantial likelihood\" that he was misidentified.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSihvola asked Judge Cannon to order a hearing to explore how Routh was identified as the person TCM saw running from the golf club. Sihvola said, \"The totality of the circumstances suggest it was unreliable.\"\n\nProsecutor Christopher Browne told the judge the witness, TCM, was a \"good Samaritan\" who heard gunshots and made a U-turn in his vehicle to get a better look at the person he saw running from the golf club. \"There is zero potential for misidentification in this case, \"he said.\n\nProsecutors also asked the judge to exclude Routh's lawyers from arguing their client lacked the mental or physical capacity to pose a real threat to Trump.\n\nThe SKS-style rifle left at the scene wasn't fired and had a scope attached to it in a makeshift manner using electrical tape. Routh's lawyers want their own experts to testify on how well or whether it would have worked if fired at Trump that day. The judge granted a defense request to conduct a live-fire test of the weapon, but said it could not be tested for range or accuracy.\n\nRouth's trial is set to begin in September.",

He says a single pill of his prescription costs the company just 25 cents to make \u2014 but costs him about the same as a new iPhone.\n\nDAVE DAVIES, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. Our guest today, David Armstrong, is a veteran investigative reporter who, in 2023, was writing stories about challenges for patients in American health care when he was suddenly plunged into his subject in a deeply personal way. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an incurable blood cancer. He would soon be prescribed a drug called Revlimid, which is cheap to make but really expensive to buy. A single pill costs nearly $1,000 - roughly the price of a new iPhone.\n\nArmstrong decided to research the development and marketing of the drug. And he discovered tactics used by drug companies to maintain monopolies on their medications as long as possible and keep prices high. Revlimid is one of the best-selling pharmaceuticals of all time, with total sales of more than $100 billion. This is also remarkable, since the parent compound in Revlimid, thalidomide, was banned in most of the world in the 1960s, after it was shown to cause severe birth defects when given to pregnant women.\n\nDavid Armstrong is a senior reporter for ProPublica who focuses on health care. He previously reported for STAT, the online service reporting on health and medicine, as well as the Boston Globe and The Wall Street Journal, where he shared a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the 9/11 attacks. His new story about Revlimid is \"The Price Of Remission.\" You can find it at the ProPublica website.\n\nWell, David Armstrong, welcome to FRESH AIR.\n\nDAVID ARMSTRONG: Thanks for having me.\n\nDAVIES: I want to begin with your illness and the drug that you need to treat it. Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer. Tell us about its symptoms, the course it typically takes in the human body.\n\nARMSTRONG: Sure. Well, I can describe to you what happened in my situation. And every case or every patient's a little bit different, but for me, it started with a pain in my side that wouldn't go away. It felt like, for many weeks, a bad runner's cramp. And I sought out care for it and went to a doctor, who thought, you know, this is probably a muscle strain. But it ended up getting worse. And one morning, I woke up and I couldn't get out of bed. I mean, I had to grip the wall, I was in so much pain, and decided to go to the emergency room. And it was there they did some testing, some scans.\n\nAnd what happens with a lot of multiple myeloma patients is the disease really impacts the bones. It gets in there with these things called lytic lesions, creates holes in the bones, and many people don't know they have multiple myeloma until they break a bone. I talked to another patient who was golfing and took a swing, and his spine - part of his spine literally collapsed. And he went to the hospital, and that's how he found out he had this disease. So it often lurks without people knowing it's there, and it takes something fairly dramatic for a patient to discover it. So in my case, you know, I found out that I had it and then began a course of four drugs, including Revlimid.\n\nDAVIES: And how long do, typically, patients live with this illness?\n\nARMSTRONG: Well, so, you know, one of the amazing things about this particular cancer is that, you know, 20, 25 years ago, it was a very grim prognosis. You know, two, three, maybe five years is what many patients lived with the cancer, you know, before passing away. That has changed dramatically, thanks to drugs like Revlimid, in the past 10, 15 years in particular. And for many patients, you know, they can almost live with it as sort of a chronic disease. If you fail one line of treatment, there's now second, third, fourth, fifth lines of treatment. So, you know, it's many more years than it was just 15, 20 years ago.\n\nDAVIES: And with the treatments you have now, what kind of shape are you in? How's your day?\n\nARMSTRONG: So for me, it's pretty good. You know, I do have some side effects from the drugs I take. You know, there's things like fatigue. But, you know, most days, I feel good. I'm able to exercise fully and grateful that my cancer is in remission.\n\nDAVIES: So, being the dogged reporter that you are, you decided there was a story here in the high cost of the drug. We should note that you don't pay $1,000 a pill, right? You're lucky to have a health plan which covers it. But that's what it costs the health plan, right?\n\nARMSTRONG: That's right. So, you know, when I was diagnosed with this cancer, I was in the hospital. And one of the doctors said, you know, you'll get a regimen of drugs, and one of them will be a thalidomide drug. And, you know, I've covered and written about medicine for a number of years, and I said, thalidomide? How is that possible? This is a drug that does so much harm. It's - you know, it's notorious. So that piqued my interest. I wanted to know how this drug that was so dangerous became a cancer fighter.\n\nAnd then once I started taking it and received my first claim summary, I was really taken aback by the price. And, look, I'm not naive about drug pricing. You know, I've written about health care for the better part of two decades. I wrote extensively about Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, and how they manipulated the marketplace to make OxyContin appear safe and at low risk for addiction. So, you know, not naive to the ways of drugmakers' drug pricing and marketing. But even with that background, I couldn't believe that nearly $1,000 a pill is what my health plan was paying for this drug. So I wanted to know how this was possible.\n\nDAVIES: You know, thalidomide is such a notorious drug. Tell us a little bit about why it was originally developed and what caused the birth defects.\n\nARMSTRONG: So thalidomide was developed by a German pharmaceutical company as a treatment for morning sickness for pregnant women, and also to help them sleep. And it was sold in Europe - in Germany, for instance - over the counter, and there were advertisements in the U.K. telling women how safe this drug was. And it turned out not to be the case. Even a single dose of thalidomide was associated with birth defects. It was incredibly potent that way, and tragic, as it turned out. And more than 10,000 babies - and some estimates are up to 20,000 babies - primarily in Europe, Canada, Australia, were born with some really horrific birth defects, and a large number of them died shortly after birth. And this was just a - you know, a horrific scandal that rocked the developed world in the '60s and led to a number of reforms for how drugs are tested for safety, including here in the United States.\n\nDAVIES: And the thalidomide would basically cut off the development of blood vessels to the fetus?\n\nARMSTRONG: Yeah. The way I understand it is it deprived the fetus of new blood vessels that the fetus needs to develop.\n\nDAVIES: Right, which was, ironically, what made it helpful in fighting cancer tumors.\n\nARMSTRONG: That's exactly right.\n\nDAVIES: Right. So it's a fascinating story, as you tell it in the article. I mean, there's a breakthrough at a hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas, aided in part by a tenacious woman named Beth Wolmer. You want to tell us that story?\n\nARMSTRONG: Yeah. So Ira Wolmer, Beth's husband, was a interventional cardiologist in the New York area who was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in his 30s. Unfortunately, for him, this was in the mid to late 1990s, when there were really few options for myeloma patients. So they went all over the country to different cancer centers, looking for a doctor who could promise them something more than just, you know, a couple of years. And they ended up in Arkansas with a doctor named Bart Barlogie, who was gaining a reputation for trying just about anything to help multiple myeloma patients. And people literally from all over the world were going to his clinic in Little Rock.\n\nSo the Wolmers arrived there, and unfortunately for Ira Wolmer, he wasn't getting better. They did some stem cell transplants with him, but he relapsed after each one of them and was just getting sicker and sicker. But Beth Wolmer wouldn't quit. You know, she would read medical journals all day long. She'd call researchers all over the world. She was, you know, bound and determined to find anything that would help her husband. And it was in the course of doing that that a researcher told her about the work of Judah Folkman in Boston, who had a theory that if you could block blood vessel growth, you could starve tumors of what they needed to grow. And his lab was studying thalidomide. One of his researchers was, you know, deep into studying this and had actually published some work about it. So when Beth finally connected with him, he said, try thalidomide.\n\nDAVIES: And she went to Barlogie, the doctor. And he said, try it?\n\nARMSTRONG: Yeah. I mean, you know, at the time, you know, nobody really thought that this would work. I mean, it was an idea that did not have a lot of people endorsing it. But, you know, Ira Wolmer was in a desperate strait, and, you know, Bart Barlogie had a reputation for trying things. So even though he might have been, you know, somewhat skeptical about it, he agreed to try it on both Ira Wolmer and two other patients. And unfortunately, it didn't work for Ira Wolmer. He didn't get better, and he died a few months later. But one of the patients, a guy named Jimmy, showed a miraculous recovery. I mean, he was at death's door, and all of a sudden, the cancer markers in his blood started going down. And the folks in Arkansas realized that, for the first time in really forever, they had a potential drug that would help multiple myeloma patients.\n\nDAVIES: So the doctor who was treating Jimmy, this multiple myeloma patient, I guess, was involved in a study of - was it - 89 patients or so, I guess, and the results showed what?\n\nARMSTRONG: Well, so after the response that Jimmy experienced with the drug, they immediately launched a larger trial with these 80-something patients, as you mentioned. And you have to keep in mind that it had been 30 years since any kind of treatment for multiple myeloma had been approved, and even that was a chemotherapy drug that was just sort of blunt force. You know, it killed the good cells, the bad cells. It's a very hard drug to tolerate. And the success rate for that drug, which was followed by a stem cell transplant, you know, was a mixed bag. So there was tremendous excitement about the possibility of a drug, first of all, that you could just swallow and that might help multiple myeloma patients. So they did this study, and they found these were patients who were high risk and really running out of options, and one-third of them showed declines in cancer in their blood work, which was something that doctors in the specialty had never seen before. It was an incredible response.\n\nDAVIES: So it turns out there's a company called Celgene that held the patent for thalidomide. What did this discovery do to their financial position?\n\nARMSTRONG: Yeah, so Celgene was a small struggling company in Northern New Jersey, who was studying thalidomide with the idea that it would be a treatment for AIDS patients who were getting it in the black market from places like Brazil and using it to treat a condition associated with AIDS where patients would lose a tremendous amount of weight, a dangerous amount of weight. And they thought that there'd be a market for that. They - interestingly enough, to get FDA approval, the FDA approved it for a complication of leprosy. Doctors all over the world had been using it for leprosy patients to treat this condition that often causes painful skin lesions and other things. But, you know, there's only - you know, in the United States, at the time - you know, hundreds of leprosy patients, a tiny, tiny market. But when the Arkansas results came in, the people at Celgene immediately realized that this was a cancer drug, and that was a game changer for the company.\n\nDAVIES: You know, it's interesting that when they were using the thalidomide-based drug to treat AIDS patients, they kept the prices low. And there was an interesting explanation for this, which did not apply to the multiple myeloma patients. Do you want to explain that?\n\nARMSTRONG: Yeah. So when the drug was initially approved, and again, technically for leprosy, but once it's approved, doctors are free to prescribe it off-label, they call it for other indications. And the CEO at the time was speaking to - at an investor conference and said, you know, look, we kept the price low because that's what you do if you don't want protesters at your door. In other words, the AIDS community was very active. They would protest if there were developments that they thought ran contrary to the interests of the AIDS community. So they were concerned about that. And he said to the investors at the time, we have a lot of room for growth now.\n\nDAVIES: Because multiple myeloma patients wouldn't protest?\n\nARMSTRONG: You know, essentially, that's the implication. You know, one of the executives at Celgene said at the time the company had the impression that cancer patients would pay whatever it takes.\n\nDAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with David Armstrong, senior reporter for ProPublica, investigating health care. His new article about the high cost of the cancer medication Revlimid is called \"The Price Of Remission.\" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JULIAN LAGE GROUP'S \"IOWA TAKEN\")\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with David Armstrong, a senior reporter for ProPublica, investigating health care. His latest article is about the extremely high cost of Revlimid, a drug used in treating the blood cancer multiple myeloma. Armstrong himself has been diagnosed with the disease.\n\nSo we were saying that there was this discovery that thalidomide, this drug which had such a terrible reputation for causing birth defects, proved effective in treating multiple myeloma. And the patent was held by Celgene, this little pharmaceutical company. And it's interesting you write that, I guess not all patents are created equal. Celgene's patent was limited in a way. How and why does this matter?\n\nARMSTRONG: So the problem that Celgene had with the thalidomide patent is they did not have a patent for the active ingredient. And that's because thalidomide was such an old drug. It was discovered and developed in the 1950s by a German pharmaceutical company. And for drug makers, the active ingredient is a really important patent. So Celgene started to explore alternatives to thalidomide. And there was two reasons for that, at least two. One is they hoped to find a drug that didn't cause birth defects and a drug that they could patent in a more influential way. So they started studying analogs of thalidomide, and this is just a slightly tweaked version of the parent compound. You know, you move an atom here, do this here in the chemical structure. And that's how they ended up developing Revlimid.\n\nDAVIES: And when they finally released the drug in 2005, how expensive was it?\n\nARMSTRONG: So in 2005, they released the drug with a price of $55,000 a year. And that really surprised a lot of people, including the analysts who follow the company. They thought that it would be half as much as that. But the company did its own due diligence, and that was a price they thought that they could justify, and it ended up being a price that people paid.\n\nDAVIES: And what did it cost to manufacture a pill?\n\nARMSTRONG: So the cost to manufacture Revlimid is approximately 25 cents a capsule. And that was true at the start, and it was true through most of the history of the drug, and that's according to a Celgene official who testified in a court case.\n\nDAVIES: That heavy cost drew criticism, of course, including from some doctors treating multiple myeloma patients. How did the company respond to complaints that this was just too expensive? I mean, you know, the typical claim is, look, we spend a lot on researching and developing these drugs. I mean, that really wasn't the case here, was it?\n\nARMSTRONG: No. I mean, there's certainly costs associated with developing the drug. You know, Celgene should be given credit for developing this drug. It's not easy to get FDA approval for a drug, and running clinical trials is hard business. You know, that being said, the company estimated about $800 million was spent to develop Revlimid, a few hundred million more to test it in clinical trials for other cancers. You know, when you consider the revenue in excess of a hundred billion dollars, you know, it's a fairly small amount in terms of the research and development costs for this particular drug.\n\nDAVIES: So when Celgene creates Revlimid, and it's an effective treatment for this disease, they have to deal with the fact that, you know, you don't keep an exclusive patent forever. There are laws that allow generics to eventually come in, provide competition and lower prices. This company was remarkably effective in stalling that. How did they do it?\n\nARMSTRONG: They did it by turning the most dangerous aspect of this drug - the fact that it potentially causes birth defects - into an asset. They controlled distribution because the FDA, in approving the drug, mandated a safety program. They wanted to make sure that only the patients who needed it got the drug. They didn't want to see somebody accidentally take it and get pregnant and develop a birth defect. They were extremely concerned about that. So they controlled the distribution, and that meant that generic companies who wanted to develop a competing product had to acquire Revlimid from Celgene because you have to test your generic product against the brand name to prove to the FDA that they're essentially the same thing and safe. They couldn't get the drug from Celgene. Celgene simply refused to sell it to them, and they controlled the distribution. So that enabled them to really maintain a grip on the market for a number of years beyond the exclusivity period that the FDA granted them.\n\nDAVIES: And the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission became aware of this, took some steps, but somehow were ineffective, right?\n\nARMSTRONG: They became aware of it. The FDA at one point ordered or directed Celgene to sell to a generic competitor. The FDA didn't have any enforcement ability, however. The Federal Trade Commission did do a lengthy investigation, and the staff proposed taking legal action against Celgene, but that didn't happen. The company promised that they would sell the drug. The commissioners that are needed to approve litigation thought that they were going to sell the drug and were not interested in pursuing litigation at that time. And that enabled them for several more years, again, to have this market all to themselves without any competition.\n\nDAVIES: So what did that mean for Celgene in the end?\n\nARMSTRONG: Celgene still had a monopoly on the marketplace, and they maintained that monopoly until 2022. In 2015, they settled with one of the generic companies who was involved in litigation with them. And that settlement required the generic maker to stay out of the marketplace until 2022, and even when it comes into the marketplace in a very limited way - less than 10% of the market. And what's the effect of that? The price still stays high. There's not unfettered competition with generics until next year.\n\nDAVIES: 2026.\n\nARMSTRONG: That's right.\n\nDAVIES: For a drug that was released in 2005. So that's a long stretch when Celgene kind of had the ability to raise the cost of the drug at its own discretion. What did you discover about the price hikes?\n\nARMSTRONG: What we found is the company, in certain situations, used Revlimid to boost overall revenues. There was a situation in 2014 where Revlimid sales were not up to what the company expected, and a memo was sent out saying, we need a price increase. Another situation in 2017, where they had a drug that was very promising for another condition called Crohn's disease failed, and they abandoned that project. And the day they abandoned that project, they raised the price of Revlimid 9%. You know, we described it essentially as a piggy bank. They could tap Revlimid whenever they needed to, and there was really no regulator or governor on the price increases. It was really up to the company.\n\nDAVIES: And you found some evidence of objections even within the company, right?\n\nARMSTRONG: We did. 2017 - they raised the price 20% during the year. And one of the company officials filed a whistleblower complaint, and in her complaint, she said she was at a meeting, and she objected to these price increases. She said it was just too much. And she said the CEO admonished her, said, what's the worst that's going to happen, a bad tweet? And that's how she said they viewed these price increases.\n\nDAVIES: So that was the company, the CEO's response - a little complaining. Don't worry about it.\n\nARMSTRONG: Yeah. Might be a bad story here or there or a bad tweet, but, you know, why wouldn't we take the increase, is what she quoted him as saying.\n\nDAVIES: We need to take another break here. We are speaking with David Armstrong. He is a senior reporter for ProPublica. His new story about the high cost of the cancer drug Revlimid is \"The Price Of Remission.\" He'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ANORAAK SONG, \"HERE YOU GO\")\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Our guest is David Armstrong, senior reporter for ProPublica. His latest story is about the high cost of the cancer-treating drug Revlimid, which costs about a quarter a pill to manufacture, but sells for nearly $1,000. Armstrong was writing stories about challenges in the health care system in 2023 when he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an incurable blood cancer. He was prescribed Revlimid and began looking into the history and marketing of the drug. His new story on the ProPublica website is \"The Price Of Remission.\" We recorded our interview Monday.\n\nYou know, along with the story that you've just published about the price of Revlimid, you have a companion story which asks the question, \"Why Do Americans Pay More For Prescription Drugs?\" And you're right that Americans do pay more than other wealthy countries for the same drugs. Why?\n\nARMSTRONG: Well, I think the big reason is that here in the United States, we do not have a single payer of health care. We're one of the few countries where the government is not the provider or the sole provider of health care. And that makes it hard to negotiate. We have a very fractionalized system in terms of the number of payers. You know, there's hundreds and hundreds of private payers. Even among the government, there's Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense, who are all big payers. So it's very hard to negotiate a price when everybody's doing their own negotiating.\n\nDAVIES: Right. Well, you know, President Trump has announced that he's signed an executive order, which he says will require pharmaceutical companies in the United States to give Americans the lowest price they charge to other countries, which he says are much cheaper in Europe, for example. And he says that'll have a big impact. What's your sense of what we might expect from this effort?\n\nARMSTRONG: Well, you know, I think first of all, the administration should be given some credit for bringing attention to this issue and pledging to do something about it. I think the executive order didn't have a lot of specific mechanisms for how this is going to be accomplished. A lot of it will be down the road. They talk about getting together with the drug companies and discussing prices of certain drugs. And if that doesn't work, they could turn to rule-making, which would probably be Medicare and Medicaid programs, instituting rules on what prices they will pay for drugs.\n\nBut, you know, a lot of it is - the devil's in the details here, and I think we'll have to see. It's a complicated thing to get these prices down, you know, that doesn't even address the issue of what drug prices are launched at. You know, cancer drugs in particular are being launched at prices that are so expensive that, you know, you have nowhere to go when you start negotiating a decreased price because they started so high. So we'll have to see.\n\nDAVIES: Right. You know, there's been a lot of discussion of the federal government negotiating for better prices for Medicaid and Medicare, where they're - the government is, in fact, the one buying the product. In the case of, you know, controlling transactions among two private entities - right? - I mean, an American drugmaker and American buyers and those who buy in Europe - you're really talking about price controls, aren't you?\n\nARMSTRONG: I think you can make the argument it is. And the reality with, you know, things like this executive order is that whatever comes from it in terms of real, concrete actions is likely to be challenged in court. You know, the Trump administration ran into this problem the first time around. They proposed a very modest, I think, idea where they would test out drug pricing for some of the Medicare drugs that are administered in a doctor's office. And that, you know, was held up by the courts, and then the first administration expired. So it's going to be a fight. You know, the pharma lobby is not to be underestimated. You know, they spend billions of dollars on lobbying, or millions, I should say. So this will be a tough fight, trying to wrangle prices down.\n\nDAVIES: Right. Now, the Biden administration has claimed credit for reducing prices of certain widely used drugs, I think particular diabetes medications. Is that similar, different here?\n\nARMSTRONG: The Biden effort, frankly, was much more modest, at least in execution. The Trump administration is promising, you know, greater results. We'll have to see. But, you know, essentially, the Inflation Reduction Act that was from the Biden administration allowed Medicare some limited ability to negotiate prices on, in the first year, 10 drugs, the next year, 15 drugs. But the Congressional Budget Office found that those impacts are going to be very modest. You know, it's not going to change the game, essentially.\n\nDAVIES: You know, one other thing President Trump said when he was talking about his new executive order is that he plans to cut out the, quote, \"middlemen\" in drug purchasing who make a fortune without ever offering a product. I guess these are presumably the pharmacy benefit managers, whose role I've read about but don't really understand. Is he right?\n\nARMSTRONG: Well, you're not alone in not understanding that. It's very opaque. It's very secretive. Lots of people have tried to crack the code there, and it's difficult. These are middlemen that set prices through sometimes secret rebates and discounts back to the drugmaker. And on the other side, they have the health insurer. And a lot of people have called for transparency in pricing. What is the actual price, taking out all of these rebates and other things that the middlemen put in? So there's been a lot of calls to eliminate the middlemen. President Trump said something like, you know, they're taking money out of the system without actually making a product. And I think there's some truth to that. But again, this is a very entrenched interest in the drug pricing arena, and it'll be hard to do.\n\nDAVIES: You know, the drug companies say in their defense that, yes, they make a lot of money, but that's the cost of doing all the expensive research and testing that it requires to get new medications, to innovate. How well does their defense stand up?\n\nARMSTRONG: Well, you know, the fact of the matter is - and there's been some studies about this - you know, industry funding of research is certainly important, but government funding has been just as important. You know, 300-and-something drugs approved by the FDA in the last decade. All but two of them had some element of government funding in them. So there are some studies out there suggesting that the industry estimates of what it costs them to bring a drug to market, what they spend on research and development, have been inflated. And perhaps most damning, the House Oversight Committee did a study that found drugmakers spend more on stock buybacks and investor dividends than they do on research and development.\n\nDAVIES: You know, I've always wondered when - I mean, like in the case of Revlimid, I mean, the medical breakthroughs, the research breakthroughs, occurred here, I guess, at a hospital in Arkansas. And doctors in Boston - what kind of credit or compensation did they or their institutions get for this breakthrough drug?\n\nARMSTRONG: So the doctors in Arkansas didn't get anything. At least the ones I've spoken to, you know, there was no financial benefit to them from this discovery. And, you know, the ones I talked to said they really weren't looking for that. They were just incredibly gratified to find something that was going to help patients. You know, it was a pretty grim period where, you know, they want to help patients. They want to get them better and give them an extension of life, and it was really hard to do before this discovery. The Boston doctors who were researching this drug - they didn't directly get something, but their institution did. They get royalties from Revlimid, so there is a little bit of a benefit there to the research institution.\n\nDAVIES: Is it typically the case that, you know, grants from the National Institutes of Health, which go to, you know, research hospitals and teaching hospitals all over the country - that when they achieve something that's lucrative for a drug company, they share in the proceeds?\n\nARMSTRONG: Yeah, I think usually that's the case. And, you know, a lot of the most important developments have come out of academic labs, hospital labs. And, you know, these labs are willing to take chances that often pharmaceutical companies aren't. You know, they will study things that a drug company might look at and say, oh, there's not a big enough market, or we're not sure that this will work. So once they're found in the labs, they often strike deals with pharmaceutical companies. It might be a royalty arrangement or something else, but that's not uncommon.\n\nDAVIES: Going to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with David Armstrong. He is a senior reporter for ProPublica investigating health care. His new article about the high cost of the cancer medication Revlimid is \"The Price Of Remission.\" We'll talk more after this break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE WEE TRIO'S \"LOLA\")\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with David Armstrong, a senior reporter for ProPublica investigating health care. His latest article is about the extremely high cost of Revlimid, a drug used in treating the blood cancer multiple myeloma. Armstrong himself has been diagnosed with the disease.\n\nYou know, we talked about the high cost that people pay for prescription medications. You've also written about many cases in which insurance companies deny doctors and patients reimbursement for certain tests or treatments that they have ordered. And you wrote extensively about a young man named Christopher McNaughton who suffered from a condition called ulcerative colitis. This really affected him in a bad way - got it when he was in college. He finally got to the Mayo Clinic. He had a doctor, Edward Loftus, who put him on doses of two biologics, which are more expensive drugs 'cause of the way they're produced. But his insurance company, UnitedHealth, scrutinized the cost. What ensued then?\n\nARMSTRONG: Well, you know, this was a situation where Christopher McNaughton had a very serious case of ulcerative colitis. He had to drop out of college. He was a basketball player in college. He was losing a tremendous amount of weight, so it was a really detrimental effect to his life. And he struggled to find a specialist who could give him some relief from this disease. And that's when he got to the Mayo Clinic and found Dr. Edward Loftus, who prescribed a pretty aggressive regimen of drugs that were very expensive.\n\nAnd the interesting thing about Christopher McNaughton's case is he sued UnitedHealth and was able to access records about the company's decisions on his health care, including some audio recordings, and it was apparent from these records that cost was the issue. And what they did was they denied his care, saying it was not medically necessary because the regimen that his doctor prescribed was not an ordinary regimen. Chris had a very extreme case, and his doctor said that cutting him off in this regimen would be life-threatening.\n\nDAVIES: Right. Even delaying care could be terribly damaging, right?\n\nARMSTRONG: That's true. This is a - you know, a very serious case that had a debilitating effect on a young man.\n\nDAVIES: Yeah. There was also a moment at which UnitedHealthcare said that the doctor who had diagnosed him and had provided this elaborate and expensive treatment - that he was agreeing that a lower dose of the medication would be medically appropriate, which was simply not true, right?\n\nARMSTRONG: It was not true, and it was reflected in internal documents that he had said this when he had never said that. You know, they did admit later that he'd never said that. But there was such an effort to control the cost of Chris McNaughton's care that these kinds of things happened - in this case, you know, something that simply wasn't true, and in other cases, sort of misrepresenting what his care was all about. And, you know, finally, Chris did win his case. You know, he won an agreement from the company to continue his care. A lot of details of that settlement are not public, but it took a tremendous effort, and most people are not so equipped to do something like that. In fact, it's so rare to find somebody who's actually sued their health insurer over denied care. It's an expensive proposition. People are sick. They don't necessarily want to go through it. So his case was extraordinary, both on what it revealed and the outcome.\n\nDAVIES: What did the UnitedHealthcare officials say when you reached out to them for explanation? I mean, you know, they had these documents, these recordings. It must have looked terrible.\n\nARMSTRONG: Well, they didn't answer my specific questions but did say that they ultimately paid for his care. And they did point out that the dosages he was receiving, you know, exceeded what was in FDA guidelines, which, you know, his doctor said was necessary to get his disease under control.\n\nDAVIES: You know, you and some of your colleagues at ProPublica looked into companies whose business it is to review claims that insurance companies have been submitted for reimbursement and help decide what to pay and what not to pay. I don't know if I'm accurately stating this. One of the biggest is called EviCore. There's another one, Carelon Medical Benefits Management. What did you find that these companies do? What role do they play?\n\nARMSTRONG: These companies essentially review claims from the insurance company's insureds and decide if they should be paid. So they're farming out the work of deciding what's appropriate care for their patients, and this is a growing business. You know, one of the things we found is that companies are engaging in a lot of prior authorization where you can't get a treatment or a drug until they say it's OK. And for patients, this can be really disturbing. A lot of them have said that, you know, essentially the insurance company's playing doctor and deciding what I should get for care rather than my own doctor deciding it.\n\nDAVIES: Right. Now, insurance companies note that there are tests and treatments that are unnecessary or ineffective and that some unscrupulous doctors and other providers pad their income by ordering tests and treatments that they know aren't indicated. I mean, that is a real thing, right?\n\nARMSTRONG: That is certainly a real thing, and I've actually written about some of that in the past. I think what has happened is that it has been broadened to such a degree that it covers a wide swath of care. You know, cardiology, there's a lot of reviews. Oncology, there's reviews. Certainly in the orthopedic world, you see a lot of insurance companies applying their own medical guidelines and analysis in determining whether someone should get that care. So I think it's true that there are cases where doctors overprescribe or order tests that aren't necessarily needed, but this has broadened into a large practice of deciding what patients should get.\n\nDAVIES: It's interesting that you have a story in which you note that anyone who is having a dispute with their insurance company about a claim - payment for a claim could get actually internal information from the company about its deliberations, including, you know, memos, emails, maybe even phone recordings. How do they do this?\n\nARMSTRONG: Well, you have a right to get that information. You can write to your insurance company to get it. We have on our website an aid for people to draft letters seeking your claim records. You know, one of the things we found when we were looking into insurance denials is that very few people ever challenge a denial. It's a small, small, small percentage - a single-digit percentage. But when people do challenge them, they're often successful, you know, as much as half the time. So if you have been denied prior authorization for something or if a claim came in and it was denied, it's worth the efforts, especially if it's a significant amount of money, to challenge it. It's well worth the effort if it's an amount of money that makes a difference to you.\n\nDAVIES: When you were reporting the story about Revlimid, you know, you're doing this research, which you've done so many times, and you're also dealing with the effects of your own illness, the multiple myeloma. I wonder, did you or any of your editors have a concern that this might compromise your objectivity or offer an opening for critics to challenge your reporting?\n\nARMSTRONG: I think that's a fair question. And the way that we thought was best to deal with that was to be transparent. You know, I have this disease. I am a patient on this drug. I could at some point be financially impacted, you know, depending on my insurance, which, as I mentioned, has changed several times. So we thought it was important to let people know. And when I sought to interview people, I would tell them, I'm a patient. I take the drug. And then people can, you know, make their own conclusions about, you know, what motivates me. I will say that being a patient changed my perspective.\n\nAnd before I even started on this story, I wondered, is it worth doing? Because for me, this is working. You know, I don't have to pay much. You know, why write about it if these high prices mean I get an effective drug? But ultimately, I came down on the side of this doesn't work for everybody and that there's so much more research and discoveries that need to happen. And we need money for that. And a lot of money is going to things like stock buybacks and executive pay and just to the bottom line. And I'm not saying that they shouldn't make a profit. They have a good drug. They should make a profit, but it was such an extraordinary amount that could have been directed to other resources that help patients in the long run.\n\nDAVIES: Well, David Armstrong, good luck with your treatment, and thanks for your reporting, and thanks for speaking with us.\n\nARMSTRONG: Well, thanks for having me. I enjoyed it.\n\nDAVIES: David Armstrong is a senior reporter for ProPublica. His new story about the high cost of the cancer drug Revlimid is \"The Price Of Remission.\" We recorded our interview Monday. Coming up, David Bianculli reviews a new documentary about the remarkable life of singer-songwriter Janis Ian, whose career dates back to her early teens.

    "body": "A federal appeals panel has made enforcing the Voting Rights Act harder in 7 states\n\ntoggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\nA panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has struck down one of the key remaining ways of enforcing the federal Voting Rights Act in seven mainly Midwestern states.\n\nFor decades, private individuals and groups have brought the majority of lawsuits for enforcing the landmark law's Section 2 protections against racial discrimination in the election process.\n\nBut in a 2-1 ruling released Wednesday, the three-judge panel found that Section 2 cannot be enforced by lawsuits from private parties under a separate federal statute known as Section 1983.\n\nThat statute gives individuals the right to sue state and local government officials for violating their civil rights. Section 1983 stems from the Ku Klux Klan Act that Congress passed after the Civil War to protect Black people in the South from white supremacist violence, and voting rights advocates have considered it an antidote to a controversial 2023 decision by a different federal appeals panel that made it harder to enforce Section 2 in the 8th Circuit.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat earlier panel found that Section 2 is not privately enforceable because the Voting Rights Act does not explicitly name private individuals and groups. Only the head of the Justice Department can bring these types of lawsuits, that panel concluded.\n\nThe majority of the panel that released Wednesday's opinion came to the same conclusion.\n\n\"Because [the Voting Rights Act's Section 2] does not unambiguously confer an individual right, the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action under [Section 1983 of Title 42 of the U.S. Code] to enforce [Section 2] of the Act,\" wrote Circuit Judge Raymond Gruender, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush and joined in the opinion by Circuit Judge Jonathan Kobes, a nominee of President Trump.\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, however, Chief Circuit Judge Steven Colloton, also a Bush nominee, pointed out the long history of private individuals and groups suing to enforce Section 2's legal protections against any inequalities in the opportunities voters of color have to elect preferred candidates in districts where voting is racially polarized.\n\n\"Since 1982, private plaintiffs have brought more than 400 actions based on [Section 2] that have resulted in judicial decisions. The majority concludes that all of those cases should have been dismissed because [Section 2] of the Voting Rights Act does not confer a voting right,\" Colloton wrote.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nUnder the current Trump administration, the Justice Department has stepped away from Section 2 cases that had begun during the Biden administration.\n\nThe 8th Circuit includes Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. The latest ruling comes out of a North Dakota redistricting lawsuit by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Spirit Lake Tribe. Citing Section 1983 as a basis for bringing the case as private groups, the tribal nations challenged a map of state legislative voting districts, which was approved by North Dakota's Republican-controlled legislature after the 2020 census.\n\nIn a part of the state where voting is racially polarized, the tribal nations argued, the redistricting lines drawn by the state lawmakers reduce the opportunity for Native American voters to elect candidates of their choice.\n\n\"For the first time in over 30 years, there are zero Native Americans serving in the North Dakota state Senate today because of the way the 2020 redistricting lines were configured,\" Mark Gaber, an attorney with the Campaign Legal Center, which is representing the tribal nations, said during a court hearing in October 2024.\n\nA lower court struck down the redistricting plan for violating Section 2 by diluting the collective power of Native American voters in northeastern North Dakota.\n\nBut the state's Republican secretary of state, Michael Howe, appealed the lower court's ruling to the 8th Circuit, arguing that, contrary to decades of precedent, Section 1983 does not allow private individuals and groups to bring this kind of lawsuit.\n\nHowe's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday's ruling.\n\nThe tribal nations who brought the lawsuit and their attorneys are assessing whether to appeal the panel's decision, Mauda Moran, a spokesperson for the Native American Rights Fund, and Brendan Quinn, a spokesperson for the Campaign Legal Center, tell NPR.\n\n\"Today's ruling wrongly blocks Native voters in North Dakota\u2014who have fought for nearly a century for fair representation\u2014from challenging gerrymandered maps under the Voting Rights Act. But Tribal Nations and Native voters will keep fighting,\" Matthew Campbell, NARF's deputy director, said in a statement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGaber of the Campaign Legal Center said in a statement that if the panel's ruling is \"left intact, this radical decision will hobble the most important anti-discrimination voting law by leaving its enforcement to government attorneys whose ranks are currently being depleted.\"\n\nSince 2021, Republican officials in Arkansas and Louisiana have made similar novel arguments in redistricting lawsuits after Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first Supreme Court appointee, issued a single-paragraph opinion that said lower courts have considered whether private individuals can sue an \"open question.\" For this North Dakota lawsuit, 14 GOP state attorneys general signed on to a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that private parties don't have a right to sue with Section 2 claims.\n\nIn a separate Arkansas-based case before the 8th Circuit, GOP state officials have also questioned whether there is a private right of action under another part of the Voting Rights Acts \u2014 Section 208, which states that voters who need assistance to vote because of a disability or inability to read or write can generally receive help from a person of their choice.\n\nMany legal experts consider this questioning of a private right of action as the prelude to the next potential showdown over the Voting Rights Act at the Supreme Court, where multiple rulings by the court's conservative majority have eroded the law's protections over the past decade.\n\nEdited by Benjamin Swasey",

    "body": "The Menendez brothers are one step closer to freedom. What to know about their case\n\ntoggle caption Nick Ut/AP\n\nLyle and Erik Menendez, who have spent more than three decades in prison for fatally shooting their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion, were resentenced on Tuesday, moving one step closer to potential freedom.\n\nAfter a day-long hearing, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic reduced their sentences from life in prison without parole to 50 years to life. This makes them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law because they committed the murders before they were 26.\n\nThe brothers were found guilty in 1996 of murdering their parents, Kitty and Jos\u00e9 Menendez, in 1989 \u2014 when Erik was 18 and Lyle was 21. The brothers maintained that the killings were in self-defense, saying they had been sexually abused by their father and feared for their lives.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhile there has long been a small but vocal group of supporters defending the Menendez brothers, a Netflix documentary and docudrama brought renewed attention \u2014 and sympathy \u2014 to the brothers' case last year. Their defense has also claimed there is new evidence bolstering their sexual abuse claims.\n\nIn October 2024, then-Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n recommended the brothers be resentenced, citing the \"complexities surrounding sexual violence\" and their \"continuous rehabilitative efforts during their incarceration.\" His successor, Nathan Hochman, who was elected a month later, disagrees \u2014 but his attempts to block the resentencing process have been unsuccessful.\n\nAll of that culminated in Tuesday's hearing, during which the brothers' lawyers argued that they no longer pose a risk to safety and several members of their extended family lobbied for a second chance.\n\nThe Menendez brothers, now in their 50s, attended via video from prison and addressed the judge directly \u2014 apologizing for killing their parents and for lying in the ensuing court proceedings, according to ABC News.\n\nErik said there was no justification for his actions, which he called \"criminal, selfish and cowardly.\" But he also said he had \"come a long way on this path of redemption,\" adding, \"I will not stop trying to make a difference.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nJudge Michael Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation work on themselves and others \u2014 as well as supportive letters he had received from corrections officers \u2014 in his resentencing decision, LAist reports.\n\n\"I do believe they've done enough over the last 35 years that one day they should get that chance,\" Jesic said.\n\nThe brothers' fate now rests with state parole officials and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has the power to either veto or grant them clemency. According to the DA's office, the state parole board is already scheduled to hold a hearing on June 13 \"as part of a separate bid by the brothers for parole.\"\n\nIn the meantime, here's a look at how the case got here \u2014 and what might happen next.\n\nWho are the Menendez brothers?\n\nLyle and Erik Menendez spent their early years in New Jersey. The family moved to the Los Angeles area in 1986 as their father, Jos\u00e9 \u2014 an immigrant from Cuba and successful RCA record executive \u2014 rose through the ranks of the entertainment industry.\n\nThey moved into a seven-bedroom mansion in Beverly Hills two years later. But the brothers say there was a dark undercurrent to their privileged lifestyle, alleging that their parents subjected them to years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse.\n\nIn August 1989, as Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez were watching TV in their living room, the brothers walked inside and shot them to death with newly purchased 12-gauge shotguns. The brothers later called 911 and said their parents were killed by intruders.\n\nAuthorities initially suspected potential mafia involvement, due to the extreme nature of the crime scene and Jos\u00e9's business connections. But they increasingly focused their attention on the brothers, who had embarked on a lavish spending spree in the days and weeks after the killings.\n\nIn early March 1990, Beverly Hills Police arrested Lyle in connection to his parents' murders. Erik, who was in Israel for a tennis tournament at the time, turned himself in days later.\n\ntoggle caption Nick Ut/AP\n\nWhat happened in court?\n\nThe case captivated much of the country, in part because Court TV broadcast the brothers' 1993 trial live.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nDefense lawyers for the brothers argued that they had acted in self-defense, with the brothers saying they feared their parents would kill them to silence stories about the alleged abuse. They alleged that Jos\u00e9 subjected them to physical and sexual abuse for years while Kitty \u2014 described as an unstable alcoholic who also abused them \u2014 let it happen.\n\nProsecutors, however, argued that the brothers were motivated by greed and money \u2014 their father's estate was worth nearly $15 million at the time of his death.\n\nIn that trial, each brother had his own jury. Both of them deadlocked, resulting in a mistrial.\n\nIn their second trial, the judge limited the amount of testimony and evidence presented about the brothers' claims of sexual abuse, a core pillar of the brothers' self-defense strategy.\n\nThat trial ended in 1996 with each brother convicted of first-degree murder. They were sentenced to two consecutive life prison terms without the possibility of parole.\n\nWhat have the brothers done in prison?\n\nThe first 20 years of that prison sentence saw the brothers kept in separate prisons, but they have been housed in the same San Diego correctional facility since 2018.\n\nThe brothers' lawyers have described them as model prisoners who have given back to others.\n\nBoth brothers got married behind bars: Erik married his pen-pal-turned-wife Tammi in 1999, while Lyle married Rebecca Sneed in 2003. Sneed announced their separation in 2024 but said she remained \"forever committed to the enduring fight for Lyle and Erik's freedom.\"\n\nLyle earned a sociology degree from the University of California, Irvine through a prison program.\n\nKim Kardashian \u2014 the reality star and criminal justice advocate \u2014 wrote in a 2024 essay that both brothers \"have earned multiple college degrees, worked as caregivers for elderly incarcerated individuals in hospice, and been mentors in college programs.\" Those efforts include launching a beautification project in their San Diego prison.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEven as he lobbied against the brothers' release at Tuesday's hearing, calling them untrustworthy, Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian acknowledged that they had \"done great things\" in prison by starting and participating in rehabilitation programs for others, per LAist.\n\ntoggle caption California Dept. of Corrections/AP\n\nWhat new evidence has emerged?\n\nLawyers for the brothers filed a habeas corpus petition in May 2023, asking a judge to consider new evidence of their father's sexual abuse.\n\nThat evidence includes a letter Erik wrote in 1988 to his uncle Andy Cano, describing sexual abuse by his father. Their lawyers had not known of the letter before the brothers saw it mentioned in a 2015 Barbara Walters television special and asked about it, according to the Associated Press. The LAist reports it was only discovered after Cano's death.\n\nAnother piece of evidence comes from Roy Rossello, a former member of the Latin boy band Menudo \u2014 which was signed under RCA during Jos\u00e9 Menendez's tenure. He claimed in a 2023 docuseries that Jos\u00e9 had drugged and raped him in the 1980s, when he was a teenager.\n\nThe brothers' case reentered the spotlight the following year, not only because of the emerging evidence but because of new coverage: the true-crime drama Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story (which Erik has criticized) and The Menendez Brothers documentary both arrived on Netflix in the fall of 2024.\n\nWeeks later, two dozen Menendez relatives gathered in Los Angeles to push for the brothers' resentencing.\n\nJoan Andersen VanderMolen, Kitty Menendez's sister, told reporters the brothers \"were failed by the very people who should have protected them.\"\n\n\"[In the 1990s] the world was not ready to believe boys could be raped \u2026 Today, we know better,\" she added. \"It's time to give them the opportunity to live the rest of their lives free from the shadow of their past.\"\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe brothers are eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law, but are not guaranteed to walk free anytime soon.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe California Board of Parole Hearings is the body responsible for determining whether individuals are suitable for release. According to its handbook, that process typically involves a consultation, then an initial parole hearing.\n\nIf the panel denies parole, it must do so for a period of three, five, seven, 10, or 15 years \u2014 at which point the individual would get a subsequent parole hearing. Even if the panel does approve parole, that decision can be reviewed and vetoed by the governor, under California law.\n\nThe governor's parole review process can take up to 150 days after a parole hearing, according to Newsom's website. Newsom said in February that he had directed the state's parole board to investigate whether the Menendez brothers would pose an \"unreasonable\" public safety risk if released.\n\nHe said the findings would be presented to the district attorney and the judge presiding over the resentencing process \u2014 and stressed there is \"no guarantee of outcome here.\"\n\n\"My office conducts dozens and dozens of these clemency reviews on a consistent basis but this process simply provides more transparency, which I think is important in this case, and more due diligence before I make any determination for clemency,\" Newsom said.\n\nThe Menendez brothers are already scheduled for a board hearing on June 13, related to a separate petition for clemency. It's not clear if that will also serve as their parole hearing.",

    "body": "With tears and defiance, Kim Kardashian faces the men accused of robbing her in Paris\n\ntoggle caption Aurelien Morissard/AP\n\nDefiant in diamonds, Kim Kardashian appeared in a Paris courtroom Tuesday to testify in the trial over the 2016 armed robbery that upended her life. The reality star and business mogul gave emotional, at times harrowing, testimony about the night masked men tied her up at gunpoint and stole more than $6 million in jewelry.\n\nHere's what she revealed \u2014 and what's still to come.\n\nA night that changed everything\n\nKardashian said she was starting to doze off in bed in the early hours when she heard stomping on the stairs. She assumed it was her sister Kourtney returning from a night out. \"Hello? Hello? Who is it?\" she called.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMoments later, two masked men burst in. They dragged the concierge in handcuffs. They were dressed as police.\n\n\"I thought it was some sort of terrorist attack,\" she said.\n\nShe grabbed her phone but froze \u2014 \"I didn't know what 911 was (in France).\" She tried to call her sister and her bodyguard, but one man grabbed her hand to stop her. They threw her on the bed, bound her hands and held a gun to her back.\n\n\"I have babies,\" she recalled telling the robbers. \"I have to make it home. They can take everything. I just have to make it home.\"\n\nHer robe fell open \u2014 she said she was naked underneath \u2014 as one man pulled her toward him. \"I was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\" Kardashian said.\n\nOne attacker leaned in and told her, in English, she'd be OK if she stayed quiet. He taped her mouth shut, and took her to the bathroom.\n\nKardashian later managed to free her hands by rubbing the tape against the bathroom sink. She hopped downstairs, ankles still bound, and found her friend and stylist, Simone Harouche. Fearing the men might return, the women climbed onto the balcony and hid in bushes. While lying there, Kardashian called her mother.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe men took a diamond ring she'd worn that night to a Givenchy show and rifled through her jewelry box. They took items including a watch her late father had given her when she graduated high school. \"It wasn't just jewelry. It was so many memories,\" she said.\n\nA changed life and constant fear\n\nInvestigators believe the attackers followed Kardashian's digital breadcrumbs \u2014 images, timestamps, geotags \u2014 and exploited them with old-school criminal methods.\n\nThe robbery reshaped Kardashian's sense of safety and freedom. \"This experience really changed everything for us,\" she said. \"I started to get this phobia of going out.\"\n\nShe often rents adjoining hotel rooms for protection and no longer stores jewelry at home, and now has up to six security guards at home.\n\n\"I can't even sleep at night\" otherwise, she said.\n\nShe also said she no longer makes social media posts in real time unless at a public event. Her Los Angeles home was robbed shortly after the Paris heist in what she believes was a copycat attack.\n\ntoggle caption Valentin Pasquier/AP\n\nA letter and an unexpected moment of grace\n\nIn a powerful courtroom moment, the chief judge read aloud a letter from one of the accused, who is too ill to testify. The letter said he had seen Kardashian's tears on television and expressed regret. Kardashian was visibly moved.\n\n\"I'm obviously emotional,\" she said in response.\n\n\"I do appreciate the letter, for sure,\" she added. \"I forgive you for what had taken place. But it doesn't change the emotion, the trauma, and the way my life is forever changed.\"\n\nKardashian, who is studying to become a lawyer, added that she regularly visits prisons. \"I've always believed in second chances,\" she said.\n\nDiamonds, defiance and public image\n\nKardashian made a fashion statement in court, wearing a $1.5 million necklace by Samer Halimeh New York. The jeweler's press release for the necklace came out even as she was on the witness stand, a reminder that visibility remains currency, even if the rules have grown more complicated.\n\nThe choice reflected defiance and the reclaiming of the image and luxury once used against her.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nKardashian said Paris had once been a sanctuary, a place where she would walk at 3 or 4 a.m., window shopping, sometimes stopping for hot chocolate. It \"always felt really safe,\" she said. \"It was always a magical place.\"\n\nWhat's next\n\nTwelve suspects were originally charged. One has died. One was excused due to illness. The French press dubbed the group les papys braqueurs \u2014 \"the grandpa robbers\" \u2014 but prosecutors say they were no harmless retirees.\n\nThe defendants face charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and gang association. If convicted, they could face life in prison.\n\nKardashian said she was grateful for the opportunity to \"tell my truth\" in the packed Paris courtroom.\n\n\"This is my closure,\" she said. \"This is me putting this, hopefully, to rest.\"\n\nThe trial is expected to conclude May 23.",

Elated supporters chanted \"Duterte, Duterte\" when the result was announced.\n\nHis youngest son, Sebastian, the incumbent mayor of Davao, was declared Davao vice mayor. His eldest son, Paolo, was reelected as a member of the House of Representatives, and two grandsons won in local races, an indication of the family's continued influence.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Duterte landslide in Davao!\" his youngest daughter Veronica posted on Facebook.\n\nPartial unofficial results showed at least five candidates backed by the Duterte family were also among those leading the race for 12 Senate positions, in a stronger-than-expected showing in Monday's midterm elections. Pre-election surveys had indicated only two of them would emerge victorious.\n\nThe results come as a boost for Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, ahead of an impeachment trial in the Senate in July over a raft of charges including alleged misuse of public funds and plotting to assassinate President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., his wife and the House speaker.\n\nSara Duterte is considered a strong contender for the 2028 presidential race. But if convicted by the Senate, she will lose her job and will be disqualified from holding public office forever. To be acquitted, she needs at least nine of the 24 senators to vote in her favor.\n\nResults of the Senate race will be known in a week. Apart from the five Duterte-backed candidates, the others leading in the top 12 included five others endorsed by Marcos and two opposition candidates.\n\nWhile the senate race outcome was encouraging for Sara Duterte, the jury is still out on how the impeachment trial will go for her, said Jean Franco, a political science professor from the University of the Philippines. If damning evidence were raised against her, Franco indicated it could hurt her chances of an acquittal.\n\nThe Senate race unofficial results also showed that support for Marcos, whose approval rating fell in April, is dwindling and could turn up surprises in the 2028 elections, Franco added.\n\nIn a statement, Marcos thanked Filipinos who voted, saying \"our democracy has renewed itself \u2014 peacefully, orderly and with dignity.\"\n\n\"We may not have won every seat, but our work and mission continue,\" he added.\n\nThe impeachment and Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and transfer to the tribunal in The Hague came after Marcos and Sara Duterte's ties unraveled over political differences and their competing ambitions. Duterte supporters slammed Marcos's government for arresting and surrendering the former leader to a court whose jurisdiction his supporters dispute.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNicknamed \"the Punisher\" and \"Dirty Harry,\" Duterte served as Davao's mayor for two decades before becoming president. He has been in the custody of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, since March, awaiting trial for crimes against humanity over a brutal war on illegal drugs that left thousands of suspects dead during his 2016-2022 presidency.\n\nUnder Philippine law, candidates facing criminal charges, including those in detention, can run for office unless they have been convicted and have exhausted all appeals.\n\nSara Duterte had told reporters after voting Monday that she was in talks with her father's lawyers on how he could take his oath as mayor despite being behind bars. She had said the vice mayor would likely be the acting mayor.\n\n",

    "body": "Medicaid cuts will hurt families and cost GOP politically, says Kentucky governor\n\ntoggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe country's Democratic governors are sounding the alarm over a Republican plan that they say would leave millions of people without access to health care.\n\nA bill drafted by House Republicans calls for hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts and steps to make it harder to enroll in or stay in Medicaid, the program that provides health coverage for low- and middle-income households. Among the changes are tougher eligibility requirements and work requirements, the Associated Press reports.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that at least 8.6 million people would lose health insurance coverage by 2034 with the proposed cuts and changes to Medicaid. Republicans also proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nAll 23 Democratic governors signed a statement saying that \"Republicans' proposed cuts would be disastrous \u2013 ripping away quality, affordable health care from families, forcing rural hospitals to close their doors, and causing fiscal chaos across the country.\" The statement also says that the notion that states will be able to backfill the cuts with state resources is \"simply inaccurate and impossible.\"\n\ntoggle caption Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nIn an interview with Morning Edition, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, one of the governors who signed the statement, called Republicans' bill a \"bad plan that is going to hurt families\" and warned Republicans that they will face electoral backlash.\n\nBeshear also discussed his state's reliance on Medicaid, where cuts to the program will hurt the most and how Democrats can push back against the GOP while being fully out of power in Washington.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nInterview highlights\n\nMichel Martin: So what are your biggest concerns should this bill become law? How do you see it playing out in your state? What are your top three worries?\n\nSponsor Message\n\nGov. Andy Beshear: My biggest concerns are the people who need health care coverage are going to lose it. Medicaid covers the people we love the most, our parents and our kids. Half of Kentucky's kids are covered by Medicaid, and 70% of our long-term care costs are covered by Medicaid.\n\nAnd so when the analysis that is coming out about this bill shows that millions of people will lose their health care. One set of analysis set up to eight and a half million. That's almost double the entire population of my state. It means that kids will lose health care. It means that seniors will lose health care. And what that means is that families will struggle to make up those dollars and to make up that care.\n\nNow, Medicaid is something that also drives and fuels rural health care. And if you remove coverage for millions of people, you remove significant revenue going into those hospital systems. So what we'll see are layoffs. We will see closures and we'll see folks that live in rural America having to drive hours just to see a doctor.\n\nAnd then finally, the cuts to snap are just mean and cruel. You know, my faith teaches me that there should be enough food for everyone. The miracle of the fishes and the loaves is in every single book of the gospel. And in a country where we grow food for all of our people, a program like SNAP just makes sure that we don't have hungry kids, that we don't have hungry families, and that ultimately everybody has the basic food that they need to get healthy and to get into that workforce.\n\nMartin: So Republicans argue two things. One is that there's a lot of fraud and waste in Medicaid. And the second is that the program has expanded beyond what it was intended for. And if you address those things, it'll preserve the program for the people who really need it. What do you say to that?\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBeshear: If you're worried that there's fraud and abuse, there are units that are already out there that are going after bad providers. I ran one of them. Just about every attorneys general office has one. And if you want to ferret out fraud, better fund those units and you will get those results. But what this plan tries to do is to add burdens to those that are on Medicaid to fill out forms more often, to check the right box, to create just more challenges so that someone will not fill out something correctly and they'll lose coverage for a certain period of time. It's what I'm also concerned that this administration is trying to do on Social Security by shutting down offices and shutting down the call center and making those on a fixed income drive an hour or two to show up to an office and to not have the right forms. This is an effort just to make it harder for people who already qualify to get the health care that they need.\n\nMartin: So there are some people within the Republican Party who wanted more aggressive cuts to Medicaid who think these cuts don't go far enough and things that they wanted are not in this bill, like, for example, per capita limits on Medicaid spending. So this represents a compromise from their perspective. Are there things that Democrats should be willing to consider in order to address their concerns?\n\nBeshear: I think you should always be willing to consider a plan that's out there. But the more hardline Republicans would have it almost eliminated, if not fully eliminated, rural health care. You look at rural hospital systems that are the second largest employer in most of the counties that they're in after the public school systems. Many of them have up to 40% of their total revenue in Medicaid. Major slashes to Medicaid, even this plan, threaten that rural health care. And I think that rural Americans ought to be able to see a doctor, ought to be able to go to a clinic, ought to be able to see a nurse practitioner in their own communities. And so what I'd say to those hard liners is go out and talk to the people in your communities. They are not for this. People understand Medicaid in a different way than they did 20 years ago. They realize how important it is to their local economy and to their family.\n\nMartin: Given the Republican Party's control of both houses of Congress and the White House, is there really anything that Democrats can do beyond issuing statements like the one that the Democratic governors did to stop this?\n\nBeshear: We can speak up and we can speak out and so can all of the American people. This is a really bad plan that is going to hurt families. And when you look at anything from polling numbers to what I hear in communities, they are going to react and react negatively to this Republican plan. This is going to cost Republicans not just in swing districts, but in many districts their seats. And so I hope they don't do it. I hope they don't do it to preserve health care for families. But if it takes electoral pressure, then so be it.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe radio version of this story was edited by Arezou Rezvani. The digital version was edited by Treye Green.",

The other three were indicted by a federal grand jury in August.\n\nProsecutors said Devagiri used customer accounts to place high-value orders and then used an employee\u2019s credentials to gain access to DoorDash software and manually reassign the orders to driver accounts that he and others controlled. He then caused the fraudulent driver accounts to report that the orders had been delivered when they had not and manipulated DoorDash\u2019s computer systems to pay the fraudulent driver accounts for the nonexistent deliveries, officials said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDevagiri would then use DoorDash software to change the orders from \u201cdelivered\u201d status to \u201cin process\u201d status and manually reassign the orders to driver accounts he and others controlled, beginning the process again, prosecutors said.\n\nDevagiri is the third defendant to plead guilty to having a role in this conspiracy. Two co-defendants previously entered pleas to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, authorities said.\n\nManaswi Mandadapu pleaded guilty this month, and Tyler Thomas Bottenhorn pleaded guilty in November 2023. Bottenhorn was charged separately.\n\nDevagiri faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. He is scheduled to return to court on September 16.",

    "body": "White House says agreements signed by the US and Qatar would lead to an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion.\n\nState-owned airline Qatar Airways has signed an agreement to buy 210 aircraft from United States manufacturer Boeing, coinciding with President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Qatar as part of his tour of the Gulf region.\n\nTrump and Qatar\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, witnessed the signing ceremony in Doha on Wednesday. The White House said that the deal for the Boeing 777X and 787 planes with GE Aerospace engines was worth $96bn.\n\nTrump said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who signed the deal with Qatar Airways CEO Badr Mohammed Al Meer next to Trump and the emir, told him: \u201cIt\u2019s the largest order of jets in the history of Boeing. That\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nTrump had initially said that the deal was worth more than $200bn and was for 160 planes, before the White House issued updated numbers after his comments.\n\nThe White House also said that agreements signed by the US and Qatar would \u201cgenerate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical next step for Qatar Airways on our path as we invest in the cleanest, youngest and most efficient fleet in global aviation,\u201d Qatar Airways Group CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter two consecutive years of record-breaking commercial performance and with this historic Boeing aircraft order \u2013 we\u2019re not simply chasing scale; we\u2019re building strength that will allow us to continue to deliver our unmatched products and customer experiences.\u201d\n\nThe sale is also a boost for Boeing and its biggest engine supplier at a time when large versions of rival Airbus\u2019 A350, powered by Rolls-Royce engines, have struggled with maintenance problems from operating in the world\u2019s hottest climates, including the Gulf region.\n\nBoeing shares rose 0.9 percent in New York, while GE Aerospace stock edged up 0.1 percent.\n\nFor the 787s, Qatar opted for GE Aerospace\u2019s GEnx engines rather than Rolls-Royce\u2019s Trent 1000, according to the administration. GE Aerospace\u2019s GE9X is the only engine option for the 777X.\n\nIt is the largest widebody engine deal for GE Aerospace, the company\u2019s CEO Larry Culp said in a statement.\n\nFaisal al-Mudahka, editor-in-chief of the Gulf Times, said the Qatar Airways purchase of Boeing aircraft is a \u201cwin-win\u201d.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s top airlines with a growing market, Qatar Airways has more demand than supply at the moment and will need the fleet, he said.\n\n\u201cI think Donald Trump and Qatar know how to package things to make political gains and economic gains.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Qatar visit is the second destination of his Gulf tour, after an initial stop in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he made a surprise announcement about lifting sanctions on Syria and then met the country\u2019s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump is to land on a third and final stop in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday for a one-day visit.\n\nNo mention of Gaza\n\nThe Qatari emir said the two leaders had a \u201cgreat\u201d few hours of discussion covering a range of issues. \u201cI think after signing these documents, we are going to another level of relations,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump thanked the emir and said it had been a \u201cvery interesting couple of hours\u201d discussing topics including the Russia-Ukraine war, Iran and trade relations.\n\nHowever, Israel\u2019s war on Gaza was not mentioned by either leader.\n\nOmar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said the fact that Gaza wasn\u2019t mentioned led him to believe the discussion is \u201congoing\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Gaza, you have the Israelis there as well. On the issue of a ceasefire, Trump can put pressure on the Israelis, \u2026 but you still have the Israelis there making decisions. This is going to be a little bit more difficult to work out,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\nUS Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was also in Doha, said \u201cwe\u2019re making progress\u201d in response to a question by Al Jazeera Diplomatic Editor James Bays on whether discussions on Gaza were ongoing.\n\n\u201cHis tone was pretty telling. He was very positive,\u201d Bays said. \u201cWhen I asked him whether that was regarding aid deliveries or a ceasefire, he said, \u2018We\u2019re making progress on all fronts.'\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he hopes there would be a positive announcement \u2018soon\u2019, but we have no indication of what that might mean,\u201d Bays added.",

The United States, however, has backed the YPG in Syria to fight against ISIL (ISIS).\n\nSince the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, the SDF has been negotiating with the new Turkish-allied government in Damascus over what its future role in a newly unified Syria and as a military force will be and what kind of governance will extend to the northeast of the country.\n\nNo laying down of arms\n\nThe removal of the PKK from the equation will likely facilitate the SDF\u2019s integration with Damascus, analysts told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cFor the SDF, it makes it much easier to talk with the government in Damascus and also to de-escalate their relations with Turkey,\u201d said Wladimir van Wilgenburg, an analyst of Kurdish politics based in Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq.\n\nWhile the SDF rejects Turkiye\u2019s assertions that it is the Syrian arm of the PKK, analysts said the groups have strong links.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the PKK\u2019s announcement that it would heed Ocalan\u2019s call and disarm was welcomed by SDF leader Mazloum Abdi, he said his group would not disarm and Ocalan\u2019s decision did not extend to Syria.\n\nBut this could give the group further incentives to bring its fighting force and governing structure \u2013 called the Autonomous Administration in North and East Syria (AANES) \u2013 under the umbrella of the new government in Damascus.\n\nWhen reached for comment on Monday, an AANES spokesperson told Al Jazeera: \u201cThe autonomous administration is not concerned with the internal affairs of other countries.\u201d\n\nThe SDF has clashed with Turkish-backed Syrian factions, including in the immediate days after the fall of al-Assad\u2019s regime, and sustained attacks from Turkiye\u2019s air force.\n\nIn December, the US negotiated a ceasefire between the SDF and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, which has since been incorporated into Syria\u2019s new armed forces.\n\nAbdi has been in discussions with the new Syrian government, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, over how best to integrate the SDF into the post-Baathist Party security forces and govern Syria\u2019s northeast.\n\nIncreased pressure to negotiate\n\nThe SDF has engaged in the talks with the pressure of an impending US troop withdrawal from northeast Syria.\n\nWithout a US presence and support, the SDF has feared it might be vulnerable to attacks from Turkiye or Turkish-backed factions in Syria.\n\nBut should the PKK\u2019s decision to disarm bring a feeling of security to Turkiye along its border with Syria, analysts said the relations between the SDF and Turkiye would also likely improve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe know that Turkey\u2019s hardline stance towards the SDF was very much linked to concerns over the PKK and not so much about the SDF being Kurdish-dominated,\u201d Thomas Pierret, a Syria specialist and senior researcher at the Institute of Research and Study on the Arab and Islamic Worlds, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThis is evident by Turkiye\u2019s relations with Masoud Barzani and his Kurdish Democratic Party in northern Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region, Pierret said.\n\nOf course, this new reality \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean it will be easy\u201d, according to Pierret. Under the agreement between Turkiye and the PKK, some fighters could be relocated to third countries \u2013 essentially sent into exile. There\u2019s also the possibility some fighters may decide to make their way to northeast Syria, in which case, Pierret said, Turkiye could see the SDF as a haven for PKK fighters.\n\nSo Turkiye will keep a close eye on the SDF in Syria and the SDF\u2019s negotiations with Damascus.\n\nIn the past, the Turkish military has launched drones, fired artillery and carried out air strikes against Kurdish fighters, including the SDF. And analysts said military options may still be on the table going forward.\n\n\u201cFor now, they seem to be letting negotiations take their course,\u201d Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International with a focus on Syria, told Al Jazeera. \u201cAnd that\u2019s probably related both to events in Syria but also to the PKK process.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond Syria\n\nThe PKK\u2019s affiliates and allies are spread across regions of the Middle East where Kurds live.\n\nHistorically, the PKK has operated in Turkiye as well as northern Iraq. And their allies have operated in places where Kurds live in Syria and Iran. Their struggles have often opposed the national authorities in those places or sought self-determination or federalism.\n\nOne example is the Kurdistan Free Life Party, or PJAK, in Iran, which says its goal is to declare an autonomous Kurdish region in Iran.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear what will happen with the \u2026 PJAK because they also have a number of Iranian Kurdish fighters inside the PKK,\u201d van Wildenburg said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that they will continue as a political party and not as an armed group because they are already not doing much fighting against the Iranian state anyway.\u201d\n\nAnalysts agree it is unclear whether the PKK\u2019s allies will follow Ocalan\u2019s lead and lay down their arms or, as is the case with the SDF in Syria, if they will view their own struggles as independent and make decisions on their own.",

    "body": "The Georgetown scholar is among several US visa holders targeted for deportation for pro-Palestine advocacy.\n\nWashington, DC \u2013 A federal judge has ordered Georgetown University scholar Badar Khan Suri released from immigration detention, in the latest victory for US visa holders targeted by the administration of President Donald Trump for pro-Palestine stances or advocacy.\n\nThe ruling on Wednesday by US District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles comes shortly after two other prominent students targeted for deportation, Columbia University Student Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk, were ordered released from detention as their deportation cases move forward.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference following the hearing at the federal court in Arlington, Virginia, Khan Suri\u2019s wife, Mapheze Saleh, thanked supporters who demonstrated outside of the facility.\n\n\u201cI thank everyone who came out to support the cause of a truth-telling, speaking up and standing for Palestinian rights,\u201d said Saleh, who is Palestinian American.\n\nAs with similar cases where visa holders have been targeted for deportation related to their pro-Palestine views and advocacy, lawyers for Suri Khan \u2013 who has Indian citizenship and a US student visa \u2013 argued ICE agents unlawfully detained him outside his Virginia home in March for speech that should have been constitutionally protected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration has taken the broad position that those constitutional protections do not apply to temporary visa holders or even US permanent residents. The question will likely eventually be decided by the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe administration has further relied on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify its actions. An obscure provision of the law allows the US secretary of state to deport any non-citizen deemed to have \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign consequences\u201d.\n\n\u2018Promoting antisemitism\u2019\n\nIn a separate ruling related to Columbia University Student Mahmoud Kahlil in April, a federal judge adopted a broad interpretation of the provision, saying Kahlil was deportable based on Rubio\u2019s claims he took part in \u201canti-Semitic\u201d protests. That came despite the top US diplomat providing no further evidence.\n\nSimilarly, the Department of Homeland Security had previously claimed in a post on X that Khan Suri was \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media\u201d.\n\nIt added he \u201cwas married to the daughter of a senior advisor for to Hamas terrorist group\u201d.\n\nBut speaking to reporters, Nermeen Arastu, one of the lawyers representing Khan Suri, noted that evidence backing up those claims has not been presented by government lawyers in court.\n\nArastu, who is also an associate professor of law at the CUNY School of Law, said it was notable that \u201cthe court today also pointed out that the government is kind of throwing around accusations in social media, but not presenting them in the formal courtroom setting\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd tied that to this due process concept that\u2019s so important here to understand \u2013 that at the very basic level, you have a right to understand the allegations that are being brought against you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Badge of honour\u2019\n\nCritics have further accused the Trump administration of targeting Khan Suri based on his familial ties. His wife is the daughter of Ahmed Yousef, a former adviser to assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh who left his position with the armed group more than a decade ago.\n\n\u201cHe should have never been arrested and jailed for his constitutionally protected speech just because the government disagrees with him,\u201d ACLU of Virginia senior immigrants\u2019 rights lawyer Sophia Gregg, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cHe should have never been punished for his relationship with his wife or his father-in-law,\u201d she said.\n\nLike in the cases of Ozturk and Mahdawi, Khan Suri\u2019s cases will proceed despite his release. He faces two separate legal proceedings, one in immigration court in the one challenging his arrest and detention in Virginia.\n\nHe remained in detention in Texas when the ruling was issued on Wednesday, his lawyers said, adding they were expecting him to be released shortly.\n\nSaleh said at the court that she had recently spoken to her husband from the detention centre in Texas, where he was held.\n\n\u201cHe told me if my suffering in the detention centre is because I married a Palestinian and because I spoke out against the genocide in Gaza, then I should wear it as a badge of honour,\u201d she said.",

    "title": "Key takeaways from day two of Donald Trump\u2019s tour of the Middle East",
    "body": "Trump was the first US president to make an official state visit to Qatar, and the stop culminated in a multibillion-dollar trade deal.\n\nDonald Trump has continued his tour of the Middle East with a stop in Qatar, marking the first time a United States president has made an official state visit to the Gulf country.\n\nBut just before he boarded Air Force One to fly into the Qatari capital of Doha, Trump made history in another way: He took his first-ever meeting with Syria\u2019s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa.\n\nWednesday marked the halfway point in Trump\u2019s four-day trip, which included an opening stop in Saudi Arabia and will conclude in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAnd as with his other stops, Trump underscored warming relations and expanding business ties with leaders from Syria and Qatar \u2014 though, back home in the US, the Democratic Party raised concerns about how the Republican leader\u2019s personal interests might be guiding his closed-door conversations.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from Wednesday\u2019s meetings and stops.\n\nA high-profile meeting in Saudi Arabia\n\nBefore setting off for Qatar, Trump took one of the most highly anticipated meetings of his entire trip: a sit-down with Syrian President al-Sharaa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was the first time in nearly a quarter century that the top leaders from Syria and the US met face to face. And the meeting was extraordinary for a number of reasons: Until December, the US had offered a $10m reward for al-Sharaa\u2019s capture.\n\nIt continues to list Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the armed group al-Sharaa led during Syria\u2019s civil war, as a \u201cforeign terrorist organisation\u201d, due to its past ties with al-Qaeda.\n\nBut since a coalition led by HTS toppled the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, the US has been reevaluating its relationship with the group and its leadership.\n\nThe toppling of al-Assad\u2019s government brought an end to Syria\u2019s 13-year-long civil war, and al-Assad \u2014 long accused of human rights abuses \u2014 fled to Russia.\n\nIn the lead-up to Wednesday\u2019s meeting with al-Sharaa, Trump announced that he would lift the sanctions against Syria put in place during al-Assad\u2019s leadership, a development that al-Sharaa\u2019s government praised as an economic boon and a step towards stability.\n\nOn Wednesday, al-Sharaa joined Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman for an in-person meeting, while Turkiye\u2019s President Recep Erdogan joined by phone.\n\nTrump \u201ctold President Al-Sharaa that he has a tremendous opportunity to do something historic in his country\u201d, according to a read-out from the White House. He also encouraged Syria to expel \u201cforeign terrorists\u201d and \u201cPalestinian terrorists\u201d from its borders, as well as normalise relations with Israel.\n\nThe read-out added that al-Sharaa said he shared the US\u2019s interests in \u201ccountering terrorism and eliminating chemical weapons\u201d. He also encouraged the US to invest in Syria\u2019s petroleum sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, as he boarded Air Force One for Qatar, reporters asked Trump to share his first impressions of al-Sharaa.\n\n\u201cGreat. I think very good. Young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter. He\u2019s got a real shot at pulling it together,\u201d Trump replied.\n\nA red-carpet arrival in Qatar\n\nPomp and circumstance have greeted Trump throughout his Middle East trip so far, and his arrival in Qatar was no exception.\n\nEven before Air Force One touched down in the Qatari capital of Doha, the pageantry of the visit \u2014 Trump\u2019s first international tour of his second term \u2014 was on full display.\n\nAs he entered Qatar\u2019s airspace, White House Communications Adviser Margo Martin posted video online of F-15 fighter jets on either side of Air Force One, \u201cproviding honorary escort\u201d to the president.\n\nA red carpet greeted Trump as he touched down in Qatar. The country\u2019s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was on hand to welcome him. And a ceremonial guard, riding atop white horses and camels, trotted alongside his motorcade as he was transported to the site of his state visit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely honoured to have you here. We\u2019re very excited, very happy. It\u2019s a historic visit,\u201d Al Thani said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know that you\u2019re the first American president to officially visit Qatar. So we\u2019re very honoured.\u201d\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s White House correspondent Kimberly Halkett, who has been following the US president\u2019s journey, said the opulence of Trump\u2019s tour so far has been a selling point to his domestic audiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c Americans loved the pomp and pageantry. They found it interesting to see the state dinner with the camels and to see some of the tea and coffee ceremonies,\u201d Halkett said.\n\nEven Trump marvelled at the decor inside the Amiri Diwan, the government centre of Qatar, calling the marble \u201cperfect-o\u201d.\n\nA deal to boost trade and defence\n\nTrump\u2019s White House has described the president as the \u201cdealmaker in chief\u201d, and each stop so far on his four-day tour has culminated in the announcement of a major business deal with the US.\n\nWednesday\u2019s visit to Qatar was no exception.\n\nThe White House announced that the US and Qatar had inked deals worth at least $1.2 trillion, including a major transaction which would see Qatar Airways buy 210 aircraft from the US company Boeing.\n\nThat deal alone was worth $96bn, according to a government fact sheet. Still, that was an adjustment downward from a higher figure Trump mentioned during the trip, $200bn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the largest order of jets in the history of Boeing. That\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Trump said as he signed documents alongside Emir Al Thani.\n\nIn a gesture to his fellow leader, Trump added: \u201c We\u2019ve been friends for a long time, long before politics.\u201d\n\nOther parts of the deal included purchases of drone and anti-drone technology from US defence companies like Raytheon and investments in the US energy sector.\n\n\u201cI think, after signing these documents, we are going to another level of relationship between Qatar and the United States,\u201d Al Thani said, thanking Trump.\n\nDemocrats criticise conflicts of interest\n\nBut back in the US, Trump\u2019s stop in Qatar continued to raise eyebrows among his critics, particularly in the Democratic Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe weekend before his trip, Trump faced controversy over reports that his Department of Defence would accept a luxury Boeing jet worth $400m from Qatar, dubbed a \u201cpalace in the sky\u201d.\n\nSuch a gift would have been one of the largest in the history of the presidency. And critics warned it raised ethical and legal concerns, given the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits the federal government from accepting gifts from foreign governments without prior approval from Congress.\n\nStill, Trump defended the idea on social media. He called the plane a \u201cGIFT, FREE OF CHARGE\u201d that was made \u201cin a very public and transparent transaction\u201d.\n\nHe also walked back media reports that he would use the aircraft as personal transport after leaving office. Sources indicated the plane was likely to be decommissioned after Trump left office and sent to his presidential library.\n\nUltimately, in Wednesday\u2019s meeting with Emir Al Thani, the jet was not mentioned. It is unclear whether the exchange will continue.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee nevertheless announced it planned to fly a banner over Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida to coincide with his Qatar visit, emblazoned with the phrase \u201cQatar-a-Lago\u201d.\n\nJournalists on Air Force One pressed the president about another potential conflict of interest.\n\nOne reporter asked Trump about a deal that would see an investment firm in the United Arab Emirates \u2014 the next stop on his tour \u2014 buy large sums of cryptocurrency from a company run by his family. The deal is reportedly worth $2bn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m a big crypto fan. I will tell you, I\u2019ve been that from the beginning, right from the campaign. I\u2019m a believer in crypto.\u201d\n\nTrump is scheduled to travel to the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, before returning to the US on Friday.",

Sentencing is scheduled for July 17.\n\n\u201cStewart, Pitzettu, and Ringrose have today been rightfully convicted of multiple terrorism offences,\u201d Detective Chief Superintendent James Dunkerley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThey were a group that espoused vile racist views and advocated for violence, all to support their extreme right-wing mindset.\u201d\n\nThe convictions come amid a debate in the UK over immigration rights as the left-of-centre Labour Party adopts increasingly harsh rhetoric on migration amid increasing public support for the far right. Critics said a recent speech by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in which he said immigration threatened to turn the UK into an \u201cisland of strangers\u201d helps legitimise a view perpetuated by the far right that immigration is a destructive and dangerous force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe convicted far-right group was part of a Telegram channel named Einsatz 14, in which they talked about executing former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and torturing imams.\n\n\u201cIt was their belief that there must soon come a time when there would be a race war between the white and other races,\u201d prosecutor Jonathan Sandiford told jurors.\n\nConspiracy theories that Muslims and immigrants are carrying out a \u201cgreat replacement\u201d of white people in Western nations have become increasingly widespread on the right in recent years.\n\nThat conspiracy often involves an anti-Semitic angle, portraying Jews as supporters of pro-immigration policies meant to weaken Western nations from the inside.\n\nAll three men were convicted of planning an act of terrorism and multiple firearms offences.

    "title": "Maldives parliament removes two Supreme Court judges",
    "body": "The Parliament of the Maldives has impeached two judges of the country\u2019s Supreme Court, deepening a political crisis triggered by President Mohamed Muizzu\u2019s push to amend the constitution and strip legislators of their seats if they switch political parties.\n\nThe Parliament, where the governing People\u2019s National Congress holds a supermajority, voted on Wednesday to remove Justices Azmiralda Zahir and Mahaz Ali Zahir on allegations of abuse of power.\n\nThe vote, which passed 68 \u2013 11, took place as dozens of opposition supporters rallied outside the Parliament House, calling for Muizzu\u2019s resignation and an end to what they called the intimidation of judges.\n\nThe move comes more than two months after the judicial watchdog, dominated by Muizzu\u2019s allies, suspended the two judges and their colleague, Justice Husnu al-Suood. At the time, the seven-member Supreme Court bench had been holding hearings into a petition challenging the anti-defection measures.\n\nSuood later resigned from the top court, accusing Muizzu and Attorney General Ahmed Usham of intimidating all the judges of the Supreme Court to secure a judgement in their favour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president and his lawyer deny the charges.\n\n\u201cI do not interfere with the judiciary,\u201d Muizzu told reporters during a 14-hour news conference on May 3. \u201cI have never done so. I do not control the [the judicial watchdog].\u201d\n\nThe crisis has paralysed the Maldives\u2019s Supreme Court, halting hearings in all ongoing cases, including on the constitutional amendments. It has also raised fears of renewed instability in the Indian Ocean honeymoon destination, which held its first multiparty elections in 2008, but has been roiled by political turmoil since, including a coup d\u2019etat, disputed elections, and the killings and jailing of dissidents.\n\n\u2018Attack on judiciary\u2019\n\nAzmiralda and Mahaz denounced their impeachment on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis is an attack on the Maldivian judiciary. It is no ordinary matter to bring the Maldives Supreme Court to a halt,\u201d Azmiralda said in a statement. \u201cMy hope is that one day, when the rule of law is established in this country \u2026 all of the various officials who took part in destroying the Supreme Court are held accountable.\u201d\n\nThe case against the two judges stems from the arrest of Azmiralda\u2019s husband, Ismail Latheef, during a police raid on a spa where he was receiving a massage in the Maldivian capital, Male, on December 4 of last year.\n\nThe incident happened two weeks after Muizzu ratified the anti-defection measures.\n\nThe controversial amendments stipulate that legislators elected on a political party ticket would lose their seat if they switch parties, or if they resign or are expelled from their party. The provisions effectively allow Muizzu to maintain his supermajority in Parliament, where his party controls 79 of the chamber\u2019s 93 seats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president has argued they are necessary to \u201cimprove political stability\u201d, but opponents say they would destroy the country\u2019s system of checks and balances.\n\nAt the time of Latheef\u2019s arrest, a former member of parliament had filed a petition at the Supreme Court challenging the legality of the amendments, but the bench had yet to decide to take up the case.\n\nLatheef was held overnight for more than 12 hours, on charges of soliciting a prostitute, but was released by a judge at the Criminal Court. In the ruling, the judge noted that the masseuse treating Latheef was fully clothed at the time of the raid, and that the room they were in was unlocked.\n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s office later shelved the case against Latheef, citing a lack of evidence.\n\nBut after the Supreme Court began reviewing the constitutional amendments in February, the watchdog Judicial Services Commission (JSC) took up a separate case against Azmiralda and Mahaz, claiming the two judges had unlawfully lobbied lower court judges to secure Latheef\u2019s release.\n\nThe JSC recommended that the Parliament impeach them last month.\n\n\u2018No ulterior motives\u2019\n\nThe judges have denied the charges, with lawyers for Azmiralda saying that the case was \u201cmanufactured by top government officials to suspend\u201d them \u201cin order to influence the outcome of the constitutional case before the Supreme Court\u201d.\n\nUsham, the Attorney General, has told Al Jazeera that the government \u201ccategorically denies these allegations\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no truth to the claim that the executive branch had any hand in the JSC\u2019s [the judicial watchdog\u2019s] decision,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe suspension was pursuant to law and\u2026 any suggestion of ulterior motives is firmly rejected by the Government.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case, however, has drawn criticism from the United Nations and rights groups.\n\nMargaret Satterthwaite, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, expressed grave concern last month over the action against the three judges, saying they appear to be aimed at undermining the Supreme Court\u2019s judicial review of the anti-defection measures.\n\n\u201cThe disciplinary proceedings brought against three of the Supreme Court\u2019s Justices appear to violate the principle that judges can only be dismissed on serious grounds of misconduct or incompetence and in accordance with fair procedures guaranteeing objectivity and impartiality as provided for by the Constitution or the law,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe pressure of suspensions, disciplinary proceedings and investigations may amount to an interference in the independence of this institution.\u201d",

    "title": "Did the US flinch first in tariff war with China?",
    "body": "A high stakes game of chicken has come to an end for 90 days, as both China and the US claim the upper hand.\n\nOn Monday, the United States and China reached an agreement to slash sky-high tariffs for 90 days. Though both sides claimed they could withstand a long trade war, they reached a truce quicker than many analysts expected.\n\nThe breakthrough marked a dramatic ratcheting down of trade tensions following the tariff war launched by US President Donald Trump during his \u201cliberation day\u201d announcement on April 2.\n\nTrump initially unveiled so-called reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries before pausing them just one week later. China, however, did not get off the hook and Beijing soon retaliated with tariffs of its own.\n\nTit-for-tat exchanges quickly snowballed into eye-watering sums. By April 11, tariffs on Chinese goods entering the US had reached 145 percent and levies on US products going to China had swelled to 125 percent.\n\nTensions were already at boiling point last weekend when US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and He Lifeng, China\u2019s vice-premier, agreed a ceasefire that would slash respective tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS duties on Chinese products will now fall to 30 percent, while China\u2019s tariffs on US goods will drop to 10 percent. Stock Markets rallied on the news, with the Nasdaq Composite climbing 4.3 percent on Monday and gaining 20 percent over its April low.\n\nBut one key question has significant implications for trade talks to come: Did Washington or Beijing flinch first?\n\nWhat did the two countries say?\n\nThe tariff suspension, which was sharper than analysts expected, came after two days of trade talks in Geneva, Switzerland. On Monday, the US and China released a joint statement announcing the deal.\n\nThe two countries acknowledged the importance of their \u201cbilateral economic and trade relationship\u201d as well as the importance of a \u201csustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship\u201d.\n\nThe US and China agreed to establish a mechanism to continue discussing trade relations. China also agreed to \u201csuspend or cancel\u201d non-tariff measures against the US, but did not provide any details.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Geneva last weekend, China\u2019s Vice Premier He described the talks as \u201ccandid, in-depth and constructive\u201d.\n\nFor his part, US Treasury Secretary Bessent told Bloomberg Television on Monday that \u201cboth sides agree we do not want a generalised decoupling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe US is going to do a strategic decoupling in terms of the items that we discovered during COVID were of national security interests \u2013 whether it\u2019s semiconductors, medicine, steel,\u201d Bessent said.\n\nAfter the talks concluded, Trump praised negotiations as a \u201cgreat trade deal\u201d, adding \u201cwe\u2019re not looking to hurt China.\u201d He then claimed a personal win, saying he had engineered a \u201ctotal reset\u201d with Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, Hu Xijin, former editor of the Chinese state-run Global Times publication, said on social media that the deal was \u201ca great victory for China\u201d.\n\nWhat are the terms of the pause?\n\nAfter the tariff pause had been announced, Bessent said it\u2019s \u201cimplausible\u201d that reciprocal tariffs on China will fall below 10 percent. However, he said the April 2 level \u2013 set by President Trump at 34 percent \u2013 \u201cwould be a ceiling\u201d.\n\nHe also said \u201cwe could see some amount of the fentanyl tariffs\u2026 come off.\u201d Earlier this year, Trump put a 20 percent tariff on China, accusing it of not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl, a highly addictive and deadly opioid, into the US.\n\nFor now, Chinese goods will continue face a 30 percent tariff. In addition, specific products from China, such as electric vehicles, steel and aluminium, are subject to even higher, separate tariffs imposed in recent years.\n\nOn Monday, the White House also issued an executive order lowering duties on low-value packages \u2013 items costing up to $800 \u2013 from China from 120 to 54 percent.\n\nAnd while a minimum $100 fee on packages from e-commerce sites Temu and Shein will remain in place, the increase to $200 planned for June 1 was dropped.\n\nOn the flip side, Beijing pledged to suspend non-tariff forms of retaliation imposed since April 2, such as export restrictions on critical minerals that US manufacturers use in high-tech equipment and clean energy technology.\n\nNotably, the deal does not include concessions from Beijing on several US sticking points, like its huge trade surplus with the US or its exchange rate policy, China is accused of keeping its renminbi artificially low in order to boost export sales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTariff suspensions will be in place for 90 days. They will be subject to reviews based on broad negotiations in the coming weeks and months.\n\nWho conceded more ground?\n\nThe speed with which the US and China unwound their tariffs, taking many analysts by surprise, suggests the trade war was inflicting pain on both sides.\n\nThe tariffs were threatening job losses for Chinese factory workers and higher inflation and empty shelves for American consumers.\n\nBut for Piergiuseppe Fortunato, an adjunct professor of economics at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland, it is clear who wanted the deal more badly.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, America made more concessions than China. Second, America\u2019s economy, which is unsteady at the moment, is more reliant on China\u2019s than the other way around.\u201d\n\nIn April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the US economy was facing an increased risk of recession as Trump\u2019s trade war \u2013 and the accompanying increase in consumer prices \u2013 could unleash a \u201csignificant slowdown\u201d.\n\nFortunato told Al Jazeera that \u201cBeijing is not in such a precarious position. Take, for example, its latest export figures.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s exports grew sharply in April. The strong performance, an 8.2 percent increase from the year before, came as Chinese firms diverted trade flows to Southeast Asia, Europe and other destinations.\n\n\u201cI think that Washington overplayed its hand with Beijing,\u201d says Fortunato.\n\n\u201cThe White House overestimated the importance of the US market, and underestimated China\u2019s success in diversifying its exports away from the US since the first Trump trade war\u201d in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\n\u201cIt could take a long time to reach a detailed agreement, if one is even possible,\u201d notes Fortunato.\n\nIn 2018, the US backed away from a potential trade deal following talks with Beijing. The next 18 months saw tariff exchanges before a Phase One deal was signed in January 2020.\n\nHowever, China did not meet all the terms of that purchase agreement. It fell some 43 percent short of the $200bn worth of goods it agreed to buy from the US by 2021.\n\nThen, the US trade deficit with China jumped up during the COVID-19 pandemic, setting the stage for the current trade war.\n\nEarlier this week, Bessent once again hinted that Washington might be looking for the type of \u201cpurchase agreements\u201d that characterised the Phase One deal.\n\n\u201cThe US has made noises that it may be going for more purchase agreements. But the American economy took a hit last time from similar arrangements,\u201d says Fortunato.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first trade war with China, the US-China Business Council estimated that 245,000 US jobs were lost.\n\nAs the scope of tariffs is greater today, even after last weekend\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s fair to assume that even more jobs will be shed.\n\nIn the future, Fortunato suspects the US will \u201cland at an average tariff rate of 15-20 percent, and even higher for China. That\u2019s five times greater than what it was in January\u2026 a massive change.\u201d",

    "body": "Major League Baseball reinstates two of the sport\u2019s great players, making them Hall of Fame eligible.\n\nPete Rose and \u201cShoeless Joe\u201d Jackson have been reinstated by Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner Rob Manfred, making both eligible for the sport\u2019s Hall of Fame after their careers were tarnished by gambling scandals.\n\nRose\u2019s permanent ban was lifted on Tuesday, eight months after his death and a day before the Cincinnati Reds honour baseball\u2019s career hits leader with Pete Rose Night.\n\nManfred announced he was changing the league\u2019s policy on permanent ineligibility, saying bans would expire at death.\n\nHere is all to know about the MLB lifting the ban on two of baseball\u2019s all-time great players:\n\nWhy were Rose and Jackson banned?\n\nRose and Jackson were considered longstanding pariahs in Major League Baseball due to their gambling on the sport.\n\nJackson was a member of the Chicago White Sox team that were accused of conspiring with gamblers to purposely lose the 1919 World Series.\n\nHe accepted $5,000 to throw the series, which the Cincinnati Reds won. Eight players from that White Sox team, despite avoiding criminal charges, were banned from organised baseball in 1921.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRose was caught betting on games while manager of the Cincinnati Reds and was barred for life from baseball by Commissioner Bart Giamatti in 1989.\n\nHow good were Rose and Jackson?\n\nJackson\u2019s phenomenal career batting average of .356 is the fourth highest in MLB history. Later, after he was banned from the majors, he played baseball under assumed names in southern leagues in the United States.\n\nJackson died in 1951 but remains one of baseball\u2019s most recognisable names in part for his depiction by actor Ray Liotta in the 1989 movie Field of Dreams.\n\nRose set MLB career records for hits (4,256), games played (3,562) and at-bats (14,053) \u2013 among others \u2013 and finished with a .303 career batting average. He won the World Series three times, twice with the Reds and once with the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nRose also won three batting titles, two Gold Glove Awards, the National League Rookie of the Year and the National League Most Valuable Player.\n\nRose died on September 30 aged 83.\n\nDid Trump\u2019s pardon post influence Rose\u2019s MLB reinstatement?\n\nRose\u2019s supporters have included US President Donald Trump, who expressed on social media in March that he intends to pardon Rose posthumously. Trump didn\u2019t specify what a Rose pardon would be for, but he was sentenced to five months in prison for submitting falsified tax returns in 1990.\n\nManfred discussed Rose with Trump when the pair met in April, but he hasn\u2019t disclosed specifics of their conversation other than they discussed Rose\u2019s eligibility for reinstatement into the league.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas Trump\u2019s pardon post two months earlier behind the MLB\u2019s decision on Tuesday to lift the bans on Rose and Jackson?\n\nThe MLB would point to its in-house disciplinary procedures as the only way for disgraced players to be formally reinstated into the league.\n\nWhen is the earliest Rose and Jackson could go into the Hall of Fame?\n\nRose and Jackson won\u2019t be eligible to come up for a vote until the Hall of Fame\u2019s Classic Era Baseball committee meets in December 2027.\n\nThe committee is responsible for voting on individuals who made their biggest impact in baseball before 1980.",

    "title": "Fact check: Was cocaine on the table in Macron video with Starmer, Merz?",
    "body": "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones seized on a May 9 video of a train car meeting among three European leaders to claim they had used drugs and were trying to hide it.\n\nThe video showed French President Emmanuel Macron sitting at a table with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer. On the table before them were two blue folders, two drinking glasses and a small white object. The three men smiled for photographers who had gathered. Just as the shutter clicks started, Macron removed the crumpled white object from the tabletop and held it in his fist.\n\n\u201cDEVELOPING SCANDAL: Macron, Starmer, and Merz caught on video on their return from Kiev. A bag of white powder on the table. Macron quickly pockets it, Merz hides the spoon,\u201d Jones said in a May 11 X post. \u201cNo explanation given. (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky, known cocaine enthusiast, had just hosted them. All three of the \u2018leaders\u2019 look completely cracked out.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s post had been viewed more than 29.5 million times as of May 13 and he promoted the drug-use narrative in several more posts. \u201cBREAKING: It\u2019s Coke,\u201d he said in another May 11 post later that day. A few hours later, he shared another photo that he said \u201cclearly\u201d showed \u201ca bag of Blow\u201d. Similar posts spread in Spanish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones did not respond to PolitiFact\u2019s request for comment. But original videos of the meeting by the AFP news agency and The Associated Press and high-resolution photos captured by AP showed the white object Macron removed from the table was not a bag of white powder \u2013 it was a tissue.\n\nElysee, the official X account of the French presidency and the Elysse Palace presidential residence, posted pictures that also showed what appeared to be a tissue on the table. It said on X that the white object was a tissue \u201cfor blowing your nose\u201d, adding that \u201cthis fake news is being spread by France\u2019s enemies, both abroad and at home. We must remain vigilant against manipulation.\u201d\n\nIn an email to PolitiFact, a German government spokesperson described Jones\u2019s allegation as \u201cabsurd\u201d.\n\nJones\u2019s post also got another detail wrong. He said Zelenskyy \u201chad just hosted\u201d Macron, Starmer and Merz. However, the news reports said the leaders were on their way to meet Zelenskyy when the photos and videos were captured; they had not already met with him.\n\nWe asked digital forensic experts to analyse the close-up photo Jones posted that he alleged \u201cclearly\u201d showed a bag. Experts said they were unconvinced it was authentic.\n\nV.S. Subrahmanian, a Northwestern University computer science professor, and Hany Farid, a University of California digital forensic expert, told PolitiFact that the image could have been modified using artificial intelligence, producing an image that may make the object look less like a tissue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did the cocaine narrative spread?\n\nDarren Linvill, a Clemson University communication professor who studies Russian disinformation campaigns, said he saw the earliest mentions of this narrative in French on May 10.\n\nAt about 7:34 ET on May 11, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova posted images of the meeting on the messaging app Telegram; she\u2019d added red circles around the white object on the table. Her caption said Macron, Starmer and Merz had forgotten \u201cto put away their paraphernalia\u201d before journalists arrived to take photos, according to a Guardian report and a Google Translate translation of her post from Russian to English. Her post also described Zelenskyy as an \u201cunbalanced drug addict\u201d who used cocaine in 2022.\n\nLinvill said the false narrative proliferated across English social media \u2013 including X, Facebook and Reddit \u2013 on the morning of May 11. It was amplified and popularised by \u201caccounts known to be part of the Russian Storm-1516 campaign distribution network\u201d, he said.\n\nRussian disinformation experts told PolitiFact it\u2019s not uncommon for Russian influence campaigns to falsely accuse foreign leaders of illicit drug use, specifically involving cocaine.\n\n\u201cAnything that makes the leaders of rival nations appear debauched and corrupt works to their advantage,\u201d Linvill said. \u201cRussia wants to undercut the legitimacy of Western democracy to make their own system appear better by comparison.\u201d\n\nScott Radnitz, a University of Washington professor at the Jackson School of International Studies, said the cocaine claim tapped into \u201ca long-running Kremlin narrative\u201d that Zelenskyy uses drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA senior Russian official in 2024 called Zelenskyy an \u201cillegitimate drug addict\u201d and accused him of trying to continue the Ukrainian war to preserve his power.\n\nIn 2022, PolitiFact also fact-checked a deceptively edited video that said it showed Zelenskyy saying he does cocaine. In the original video, Zelenskyy said he likes coffee and denied he uses cocaine. Such rumours date back to the 2019 Ukrainian presidential campaign, when Zelenskyy\u2019s political rival challenged him to a drug test, which Zelenskyy took without any narcotics being detected. We found no credible news reports supporting claims that Zelenskyy uses drugs.\n\nRadnitz said far-right online influencers like Jones often disseminate pro-Kremlin conspiracy theories. Some reports have said Jones\u2019s website Infowars has republished more than 1,000 articles from a Russian state-sponsored outlet.\n\n\u201cIn this instance, the cocaine connection was broadened to also include world leaders in order to discredit an otherwise successful diplomatic engagement for Ukraine,\u201d Radnitz said.\n\n*PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.*",

    "body": "Opposing views have become more entrenched since the genocide in Gaza began, resulting in disownment for some.\n\nOn a cold December day during the Christmas holidays, Dalia Sarig\u2019s 80-year-old father arrived at her home in Vienna after she had returned from a skiing trip.\n\nHe was there to pick up her stepsister, who had joined Sarig\u2019s family on vacation.\n\nShe was convinced it would be her last meeting with her father, as their political differences were about to come to a head.\n\n\u201cI said goodbye. I hugged him,\u201d she told Al Jazeera. \u201cWhen I said goodbye, I said goodbye knowing that maybe I will not see him any more.\u201d\n\nTensions with her Jewish family had been building for years. At 56, Sarig, a pro-Palestine activist, is at odds with most of her relatives.\n\nHer parents adhere to Zionism, the nationalist political ideology that called for the creation of a Jewish state and is seen by Palestinians and their supporters as the system that underpins their suffering.\n\nSarig knew during that December meeting with her father that she intended to stage a pro-Palestine demonstration outside parliament in January that would be filmed by a local television station. The activist group she was a part of had put her forward for a broadcast interview. Appalled by Israel\u2019s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and determined to speak up, she went ahead with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe interview was broadcast and it immediately went to my family.\u201d\n\nShe later heard that her father, who also lives in the Austrian capital, had told friends that \u201cto him, I died\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut he never talked about it with me, he never reached out to me to tell me something like this. [He] just cut the relation.\u201d\n\nHer 77-year-old mother, who lives in Germany, messaged her a week later.\n\n\u201cI still have it here in my phone, saying, you know, \u2018I will not accept your political activism. You\u2019re a traitor, you are dirtying the nest \u2026 and should you change your political views, we can return to normal. Stay healthy.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe has not spoken with her parents since.\n\nFamily divides are not uncommon among Jewish families from the United States to Israel, but have become more entrenched since October 7, 2023.\n\nOn that day, Hamas, the group that governs the Gaza Strip, led an incursion into southern Israel during which 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive. Since then, Israeli bombardments have killed more than 61,700 people in the enclave.\n\n\u201cI think one of the most interesting phenomena among the liberal Zionists is the fact, while the majority moved to the right because of October 7, a minority became even more disenchanted with Israel and Zionism,\u201d the author and academic Ilan Pappe, a prominent critic of Zionism, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u2018I lost my Jewish community\u2019\n\nSarig\u2019s ancestors fled Austria in 1938, the year of annexation by Nazi Germany, for Serbia. They later settled in Palestine under the British Mandate in what is now present-day Israel. But by the 1950s, most of her relatives had returned to Austria, where she was born.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a child, she celebrated Jewish holidays while learning about Zionism from elders.\n\nShe was also told that Palestinians \u201care the enemies, they want to kill all the Jews \u2026 that the Jews living there [in Israel] wanted peace, but the Arabs did not\u201d.\n\nAt 18, she moved to Israel, where, at her parents\u2019 encouragement, she joined a leftist Zionist youth movement.\n\nOver 13 years in Israel, she joined a kibbutz, served in the Israeli army in an office role, and married. But it was as she studied politics and Middle East history at Haifa University that her worldview began to change.\n\nThat\u2019s where she met a Palestinian professor and later became an activist for Palestinian rights.\n\n\u201cIt began on a lawn in an evening together with my Palestinian teacher, when he told me the story of his family that was displaced from a small village.\n\n\u201cI understood that what I have been told, the Zionist narrative, is wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI started to think how he might feel, how he\u2019s feeling, or how I might feel as a Palestinian living in a Jewish state where my ancestors were expelled.\u201d\n\nBack in Austria, her family would argue with her at gatherings, agree never to speak again on Palestine and Israeli politics, break their promises, and clash once again.\n\nIn 2015, she renounced her Israeli citizenship as a gesture against Zionism.\n\n\u201cIt makes my activism easier,\u201d Sarig said, on being disowned by some of her family. \u201cI lost my Jewish community because I was considered at best, strange and weird, and at worst, a traitor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut being cut off from one\u2019s family can take a toll on mental health, say experts.\n\n\u2018My outlook hasn\u2019t significantly changed since October 7\u2019\n\nAccording to Faissal Sharif, a neuroscientist and doctoral student at the University of Oxford, brain imaging studies have shown that \u201cthe experience of social isolation triggers activity in areas that would otherwise light up in response to physical pain\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn other words, social pain is not metaphorical \u2013 it is biologically real,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\nFamilies, he said, often form \u201cmicrocultures\u201d with their own rules and positions on political issues.\n\n\u201cThe betrayal felt when love and acceptance are made conditional upon silence or complicity in the genocide can be deeply wounding. In the context of Gaza, it adds an additional layer of trauma: not only is one bearing witness to mass suffering, but also paying a personal price for refusing to look away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis leads to long-lasting stress and anxiety, which can reach clinical levels.\u201d\n\nTo preserve relationships, he said families need to lead with \u201ccuriosity, not confrontation\u201d.\n\n\u201cEspecially when the topic is something as painful as war or genocide, facts alone won\u2019t move people \u2013 naming the emotions underneath, like fear, guilt, or grief, often opens more space for real dialogue.\u201d\n\nHaving such conversations isn\u2019t easy.\n\nJonathan Ofir, a musician who was born in an Israeli kibbutz and emigrated to Denmark in the late 1990s, said that it was in 2009 that he realised he had \u201cactually been indoctrinated into a propaganda that omitted a whole Palestinian viewpoint\u201d. He read Pappe\u2019s book, The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, describing that experience as a \u201cturning point\u201d for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround the same time, he read other Jewish and Palestinian writers who \u201cchallenged the Zionist narrative\u201d.\n\n\u201c[But] I didn\u2019t share this publicly and I didn\u2019t share it with my family either.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, though, during Israel\u2019s war on Gaza \u2013 the third within seven years \u2013 he said he felt confident enough to express his critical views \u201coutwards and publicly\u201d.\n\nMore than 2,000 Palestinians \u2013 including 551 children \u2013 were killed during the 50-day conflict.\n\nHe took to Facebook to post an image of Israelis gathered on a hilltop near Sderot watching on as Gaza burned, a photograph that was featured in The New York Times.\n\nA relative soon wrote him an email that concluded by recommending that Ofir \u201cstop posting on the internet\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt became this heated debate, but it very, very quickly stopped.\u201d\n\nYears later, he learned that his family in Israel had decided to avoid talking about politics around him \u201cso as to not legitimise my political views\u201d, he said.\n\nAfter the October 7 attack, he checked on his extended family who lived near the site of the assault. But the incursion did not alter his position.\n\n\u201cMy outlook hasn\u2019t significantly changed. But something changed in the Israeli society. And in that sense, you could say we might be more distant politically.\u201d\n\n\u2018This is really the only issue nowadays\u2019\n\nNetherlands-based Daniel Friedman, 44, was raised in South Africa by his father, Steven, an academic and vocal critic of Zionism, and his mother, who was part of a circle of anti-Apartheid activists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile his father remains an anti-Zionist, Friedman said that he and his mother have increasingly been clashing over Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza since late 2023.\n\n\u201cThis is really the only issue nowadays\u201d affecting the conversations and bonds within some Jewish communities, he said.\n\nOne of their earlier arguments regarded the debunked claims that Palestinian fighters raped women during the October 7 incursion. After several uneasy disputes, often battled out by ping-ponging various newspaper links to support their arguments on WhatsApp, they have agreed to stop talking about politics.\n\n\u201cI love her, but what I struggle with is that I\u2019ve lost a lot of trust for her,\u201d said Friedman.\n\nDuring a previous Israeli war on Gaza, his mother had signed a petition calling for a ceasefire, a move which saw her rejected by some family members. \u201cI think that had quite a big effect,\u201d he said. \u201cShe kind of went to the right.\u201d\n\nHe said that he understands that for some, taking a stand means risking losing the support of a close community. He, however, chose to \u201ccut a lot of people out of my life on purpose\u201d after October 7, he said.\n\nBack in Vienna, Sarig is busy organising a conference of Jewish anti-Zionists in June, featuring speakers such as Stephen Kapos, a UK-based Holocaust survivor, the American podcaster and commentator Katie Halper and Ronnie Barkan, a Jewish Israeli activist. Pappe too is expected to attend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the killings in Gaza continue, her focus, she said, is on the Palestinians trying to survive Israeli fire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the victim,\u201d Sarig said.",
    "summary": "\u201cWhen I said goodbye, I said goodbye knowing that maybe I will not see him any more.\u201dTensions with her Jewish family had been building for years.\nFamily divides are not uncommon among Jewish families from the United States to Israel, but have become more entrenched since October 7, 2023.\n\u2018I lost my Jewish community\u2019Sarig\u2019s ancestors fled Austria in 1938, the year of annexation by Nazi Germany, for Serbia.\nAdvertisementAround the same time, he read other Jewish and Palestinian writers who \u201cchallenged the Zionist narrative\u201d.\nBack in Vienna, Sarig is busy organising a conference of Jewish anti-Zionists in June, featuring speakers such as Stephen Kapos, a UK-based Holocaust survivor, the American podcaster and commentator Katie Halper and Ronnie Barkan, a Jewish Israeli activist.",

Meanwhile, stock prices have recovered most of the lost ground and the benchmark S&P has again turned positive for the year. We can't say the recent downdraft was unexpected. Indeed, in our 2025 Market Outlook, we noted that investor complacency was high, that tariffs and trade wars could slow the economy, and that stock valuations were susceptible in the event of a sell-off in the Information Technology sector. That was our \"Bearish Case,\" and certain elements are likely to linger for the next few months, at least. Our \"Base Case\" called for another year of growth in the U.S. economy (and no recession), declining interest rates, and double-digit EPS growth. Each of those planks in the \"Base Case\" platform is currently in place. So assuming that the Trump administration gets its economic growth plans firmly on track, there's reason to expect that equity prices can't continue to recover. Back to the market, the current VIX fear index reading is around 18.0, which is again below the 10-year average of 20",

The prosecutor\u2019s office did not name a suspect.\n\nSeconds before the incident, M\u00e1rquez was seen on her TikTok live stream seated at a table clutching a stuffed toy. She was heard saying, \u201cThey\u2019re coming,\u201d before a voice in the background asked: \u201cHey, Vale?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d M\u00e1rquez replied, just before muting the sound on the live stream.\n\nMoments later, she was shot to death.

M\u00e1rquez, who appeared concerned, said she was not planning to wait for the person to come back.\n\nMexico is tied with Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia as the countries with the fourth-highest rates of femicide in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the latest data from the United Nations economic commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, at 1.3 such deaths for every 100,000 women in 2023.\n\nJalisco is ranked sixth out of Mexico\u2019s 32 states, including Mexico City, for homicides, with 906 recorded there since the beginning of President Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s term in October 2024, according to the data consultancy TResearch.",

    "title": "Trump cabinet member\u2019s links to El Salvador crypto firm under scrutiny",
    "body": "Trump administration\u2019s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and his family have had extensive business interests linked to El Salvador, whose authoritarian leader Nayib Bukele has grown close to the White House and who has courted controversy by imprisoning people deported from the US in an immigration crackdown.\n\nEl Salvador also plays host to a booming cryptocurrency and new media industry, which has numerous ties to Donald Trump allies who are seeking to make money from various ventures which have sometimes drawn the attention of authorities or ethics watchdogs.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and Office of Government Ethics (OGE) filings, along with public records in the US and El Salvador, indicate that Cantor Fitzgerald, the firm Lutnick headed until weeks ago before handing off to a management team including two of his sons, holds an effective 5% stake in the cryptocurrency firm Tether, has negotiated several investments on behalf of the highly profitable company, and is custodian of the US treasury holdings from which those profits arise.\n\nThe Guardian contacted the commerce department\u2019s public affairs office seeking comment from Lutnick on this reporting and received no response.\n\nOne of Cantor\u2019s investments was a $775m purchase of shares in Rumble, a Trump-aligned video platform, in a deal that closed in February. Just ahead of that deal closing, Rumble inked another deal to provide cloud services to El Salvador\u2019s government, with Bukele\u2019s regime saying the arrangement rested on shared values of \u201cfreedom, innovation and prosperity\u201d.\n\nAs well as facilitating the buy \u2013 which allowed Rumble insiders to cash out with nine- and 10-figure windfalls \u2013 Cantor has been a longterm investor in Rumble since it sponsored the special purpose acquisition company (Spac) that took the platform public.\n\nTether relocated to El Salvador in January, where the regime allows crypto firms to operate tax- and regulation-free \u2013 and has taken advantage of further tax breaks to accumulate real estate in downtown San Salvador alongside transplanted US crypto influencers and members of Bukele\u2019s family.\n\nNew York Times reporting this week revealed some of the relationships previously scandal-plagued for Tether have become more palatable in Washington during the Trump administration, but not the extent of the company\u2019s ties to El Salvador.\n\nCantor and Lutnick\u2019s El Salvador deals raise further questions about the Trump administration\u2019s deepening involvement with Bukele\u2019s authoritarian regime, which has imprisoned 2% of its population during a two-year \u201cstate of exception\u201d, which has consolidated Bukele\u2019s power during a harsh crackdown on criminal gangs.\n\nThey also raise questions about the direction of cryptocurrency regulations after Tether\u2019s founder, Giancarlo Devasini, reportedly told associates in November that Lutnick would \u201cuse his political clout\u201d to lift the regulatory scrutiny that has plagued the troubled firm for almost a decade.\n\nTether\n\nTether \u2013 which reportedly mints the world\u2019s most traded cryptocurrency \u2013 has attracted controversy since it was founded in 2014 alongside sister company Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange by Devasini, an Italian former cosmetic surgeon who has relocated to El Salvador.\n\nIncreasingly, it also attracted hostile attention from US regulators. As recently as October, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Manhattan US attorney\u2019s office was investigating Tether for its use in sanctions busting, money laundering, and \u201cto fund illegal activities such as the drug trade, terrorism and hacking\u201d.\n\nThat was the 19th time that Tether had attracted US government action, according to reporting at Protos, a cryptocurrency watchdog outlet. Many previous investigations and prosecutions alleged a fundamental fraud at the heart of Tether\u2019s business.\n\nThe main product, USDT, is a stablecoin, a cryptocurrency whose value is exactly equivalent to that of the US dollar.\n\nAs the name implies, stablecoins are intended to offer a stable reservoir of value amid the volatility of crypto markets, allowing investors to trade, invest and transfer funds in dollar-equivalent values.\n\nIts dollar equivalence is purportedly secured by an amount of US dollars, or easily converted equivalent assets, so that any holder can convert their USDT into dollars at any time. In theory, the company derives its profits from interest on the holdings that back its cryptocurrency.\n\nBut cryptocurrency traders, critics, government agencies and law enforcement have persistently questioned whether Tether holds reserves equivalent to the USDTs it has issued.\n\nIn 2021, Tether and Bitfinex agreed to jointly settle a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) suit with a payment of $42.5m, with $41m of that coming from Tether.\n\nIn their statement on the fines, CFTC said: \u201cFrom at least June 1, 2016 to February 25, 2019, Tether misrepresented to customers and the market that Tether maintained sufficient U.S. dollar reserves to back every USDT in circulation.\u201d\n\nInstead, the statement said: Tether had \u201crelied upon unregulated entities and certain third-parties to hold funds comprising the reserves; co-mingled reserve funds with Bitfinex\u2019s operational and customer funds; and held reserves in non-fiat financial products\u201d.\n\nThe same year, they had paid $18.5m to the New York attorney general\u2019s office to settle a suit that foreshadowed the circumstances surrounding the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The attorney general\u2019s office alleged that Tether had commingled client and corporate funds to cover up an $850m shortfall in their reserves.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Tether and Bitfinex were not required to admit wrongdoing.\n\nIn January, Protos reported in summary that the company had \u201clied repeatedly about the quality and quantity of its backing\u201d.\n\nThe company has also resisted compliance with regulations designed to ensure that stablecoins including USDT have sufficient backing.\n\nTether is not currently listed on European exchanges because of the company\u2019s refusal to comply with the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets (Mica) framework, effective from 1 January. It requires stable issuers operating in Europe to obtain authorization as an electronic money institution, and to hold at least 60% of their reserve assets in European banks.\n\nOther allegations have probed Tether\u2019s knowledge and involvement in the use of the token in illicit activities like sanctions busting and trafficking.\n\nRicardo Valencia, an assistant professor at California State University, Fullerton, and a former staffer at the Salvadorian US embassy under a previous administration, said that the growing relationship between Tether and the Bukele regime was unsurprising.\n\nWhile the Trump regime was exploiting the \u201ccrypto gulag horror movie\u201d of Cecot, a destination of summarily deported immigrants under Trump, both the US administration and Tether were exploiting the fact that \u201cyou can pay the Salvadoran government to do shady deals for a fee,\u201d Valencia said.\n\nLutnick and Tether\n\nThe extent of Lutnick\u2019s relationship with Tether only fully came to light during his confirmation hearings in January, when US senators including Democrat Elizabeth Warren sought to shed light on how entwined Lutnick\u2019s business affairs were with the cryptocurrency firm.\n\nOn 27 January, just ahead of those hearings, Warren sent a letter to Lutnick that in part said: \u201cYour deep involvement with and support for Tether, a known facilitator of criminal activity that has been described as \u2018outlaws\u2019 favorite cryptocurrency,\u2019 raises concerns about your judgment and ability to put the interests of the American people ahead of your own financial interests.\u201d\n\nIn the hearings, Lutnick disclosed that a 2024 deal gave Cantor a convertible bond equivalent to a 5% stake in Tether, whose value he put at $600m. Meanwhile, according to the Wall Street Journal, Cantor \u201cholds most of Tether\u2019s $134 billion in assets, largely US Treasury bills, in exchange for tens of millions of dollars in fees each year\u201d.\n\nThe relationship began at a time when Tether was in perhaps its deepest crisis. After they had paid the combined $61m in settlement funds to the New York attorney general and CFTC, Tether\u2019s Bahamian bankers lost their ability to process international payments, cutting them off from customers. Reportedly, an investment adviser from their original bank connected them to Lutnick.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Lutnick personally traveled to meet Devasini, the Tether founder, in the Bahamas in late 2021 to determine whether the company had the assets it claimed to have.\n\nLast July, he told a crypto conference that at that time, \u201cI said: \u2018Show me the money\u2019\u201d, and that \u201cwe found every penny, and they had every penny, but they had it in what I would call some pretty godforsaken places.\u201d\n\nPrevious reports have suggested that at times, Tether\u2019s backing has carried significant proportions of so-called \u201ccommercial paper\u201d: undertakings from other companies to repay loans at a future date.\n\nCantor later became Tether\u2019s asset manager, and its position as a so-called primary dealer in the treasury market meant that it could liquidate assets with relative ease. The firm also reportedly won the business of some crypto-trading firms who are Tether customers.\n\nEl Salvador\n\nEven before relocating and re-incorporating in El Salvador, Tether\u2019s managers apparently exercised significant influence in Bukele\u2019s crypto-happy regime.\n\nSalvadoran media reports show that Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, US crypto advocates who head El Salvador\u2019s national bitcoin office, are also investors in Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange that was founded by Tether\u2019s Devasini and whose management overlaps with the stablecoin firm.\n\nIn 2023, Salvadoran newspaper El Faro called the office they run \u201cBitfinex\u2019s puppet embedded in the Salvadoran state\u201d.\n\nThat year, Tether announced a $250m investment in Bukele\u2019s project that sought to harness geothermal energy to fuel bitcoin mining at a so-called \u201cVolcano Energy\u201d park.\n\nThe company also planned to collaborate in the issuance of bonds to finance the construction of a planned bitcoin city in the country, though that project never came to fruition.\n\nMore recently, Tether identities have been on a real estate spending spree in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, Devasini bought a house in San Salvador for $2m.\n\nHe also reportedly bought a historic hotel building in downtown San Salvador in a joint venture with Keiser. This purchase of \u201ca prime location in the historic center\u201d, according to El Faro, came into force after the regime exempted investors in that part of town from income tax.\n\nTether\u2019s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, bought two plots of land in the port city of La Libertad, in a deal that revealed he had been naturalized as a Salvadorian citizen.\n\nTether is also set to receive tax concessions for a planned 70-storey headquarters tower in San Salvador.\n\nThe Rumble deal\n\nIn the Rumble deal, concluded on 7 February, Tether Holdings handed $775m to Rumble, with $525m earmarked for a \u201cself-tender offer\u201d for a share buyback, and another $250m hitting Rumble\u2019s balance sheet for \u201cgrowth initiatives\u201d, according to the announcement.\n\nWeeks after the announcement, Rumble and El Salvador announced their partnership on cloud services infrastructure, despite the country announcing a separate deal with cloud titans Google in 2023.\n\nMarket analysts say this makes Tether the single largest shareholder in the company, with just more than 20% of all outstanding shares.\n\nBut the deal also put constraints on Tether\u2019s influence over Rumble. According to Rumble\u2019s 20 December press release and the SEC filing announcing the deal, \u201cRumble\u2019s existing Board and governance structure, including Chris Pavlovski\u2019s super-majority voting control, will remain unchanged\u201d, and \u201cTether will own a minority position in our outstanding common stock but will not have the right to designate any members of the Board\u201d.\n\nThis lack of say in Rumble\u2019s operations is not offset by the likelihood of near-term profits.\n\nWriting on the Tether-Rumble deal when it was announced in December, financial news site Sherwood reported that \u201cby any conventional metric, Rumble is just a really, really bad business\u201d, noting that \u201cin Q3 2023, it lost $29m on $18m in revenue, and in Q3 2024 it lost $32m on $25m in revenue\u201d.\n\nSherwood also noted that \u201cthe company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents shrank from $218m at the beginning of the year to $131m at the end of September\u201d and that \u201cat its current pace the company would be running low on cash within the next 12 months\u201d, since \u201cdespite its revenue growth, Rumble\u2019s losses have grown even faster\u201d.\n\nRumble\u2019s Trump connection\n\nTether\u2019s interest in buying into Rumble \u2013 even without any significant say over its operations \u2013 may be explained by its alignment with the Trump administration.\n\nThe company\u2019s central offering is an \u201canti-woke\u201d video platform that won favor among Maga influencers beginning in 2020, amid crackdowns on pandemic and election disinformation on leading platforms such as YouTube.\n\nAt that time, Rumble leaned into an anti-\u201ccancel culture\u201d pitch, offered signing deals to rightwing, conspiracy-minded and contrarian creators such as Andrew Tate, Tulsi Gabbard and Glenn Greenwald, and positioned itself as a pillar of a rightwing \u201cparallel economy\u201d of explicitly ideological, Maga-forward companies advocating for an ideologically inflected vision of \u201cfree speech\u201d.\n\nIn its first round of venture capital funding in 2021, lead investors were rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel and JD Vance\u2019s venture fund, Narya Capital. Vance and Thiel reportedly exited their investments after Rumble went public in September 2022.\n\nIn 2022, Trump\u2019s Truth Social platform, operated by Trump Media and Technology Group, became the first outside publisher to adopt Rumble\u2019s ad network, an alternative to dominant players such as Google\u2019s AdSense. At that time, Rumble\u2019s CEO said the ad network\u2019s mission was to \u201cfight back against cancel culture\u201d.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, the company inked a \u201cseven-figure\u201d deal with Donald Trump Jr to exclusively carry his biweekly livestream show, Triggered.\n\nRumble sued the government of Brazil, alongside Trump Media, over a Brazilian judge\u2019s order that the platforms remove accounts of a supporter of Brazil\u2019s former president, Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nOn 12 February, Pavlovski was given a \u201cnew media\u201d seat at the White House\u2019s daily press conference, where he told spokesperson Karoline Leavitt \u201cRumble was a victim of censorship at the hands of multiple foreign governments\u201d and asked: \u201cCan you describe what the administration will do to protect US interests and values worldwide?\u201d\n\nLutnick\u2019s end\n\nVia Cantor, Lutnick was also deeply involved with Rumble.\n\nUnder Lutnick, Cantor \u201cmade a fortune, thanks to a favorable deal structure\u201d, according to Forbes when it sponsored the special purpose acquisition company that took Rumble public in 2022.\n\nSpacs allow private companies to go public by merging with a shell company set up to explore such merger opportunities. They have been popular in the last half-decade because they enable companies to avoid the investor and regulatory scrutiny that comes ahead of a more conventional initial public offering.\n\nSpac sponsors, such as Cantor, are generally issued with stocks and warrants in the eventual public company with little downside risk. In the Rumble Spac, 12m shares, or 4.6% of the total, were issued to \u201cSponsor Related Parties\u201d according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n\nProspectuses filed by Rumble show that at the time the company went public, several people and entities related to Lutnick and his family had also been dealt in. Lutnick 2020 Descendants Trust UA had 375,000 shares; his wife, Allison Lutnick, had 50,000 shares; and his sister, Edith Lutnick, had 35,000 shares.\n\nThis may be the source of the holdings disclosed in Cantor\u2019s most recent holdings report, filed on 14 February, which indicates that the company he led holds 9.3m Rumble shares, which at that time they valued at over $120m.\n\nLutnick personally owned between $1m and $5m worth of Rumble stock according to his Office of Government Ethics filings.\n\nFinally, Cantor was the placement agent for Tether\u2019s buy-in to Rumble. Normally such a role attracts fees, but Lutnick said at his confirmation hearing that on this occasion Cantor waived them.\n\nRumble\n\nRumble had several officers and shareholders besides Lutnick who have since gone on to serve in the Trump administration.\n\nTech-right ideologue and venture capitalist David Sacks resigned from Rumble\u2019s board in December \u201cto pursue a position in government\u201d, according to a 13 December SEC filing. He now serves as the Trump administration\u2019s \u201ccrypto czar\u201d.\n\nSacks joined the board in 2023 after Rumble acquired Callin, the podcasting and livestreaming platform he founded, and Locals, a crowdfunding platform fronted by rightwing comedian Dave Rubin that Sacks had backed.\n\nAny share sales he made in the February deal were not subject to insider trading disclosures. However, the most recent filing detailing Sacks interest in the company from last July shows him increasing his shareholding to just over 571,000 shares, a position being worth over $4.2m in the Tether deal.\n\nEthan Fallang, formerly a board member of Rumble and Narya Capital \u2013 the Vance-founded venture firm \u2013 resigned in January to work in government, according to SEC filings. The most recent documentation of his holdings while he was still on the board show him owning some 27,000 shares.\n\nAlthough he is not subject to insider trading disclosures, filings show that Trump\u2019s deputy FBI director, Dan Bongino, has maintained his 5.72% share in Rumble since it went public. No OGE agreements or disclosures for Bongino have been made public to date.\n\nOGE disclosures do indicate that on the way into their jobs, Bongino\u2019s new boss, Kash Patel, held between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock; transportation secretary Sean Duffy held between $1,000 and $15,000; and the director of national intelligence, Gabbard, held between $100,001 and $250,000 of the stock.\n\nPatel, Gabbard and Lutnick all undertook to divest themselves of holdings including their interest in Rumble within 90 days of taking office, according to their OGE agreements.",
    "summary": "That was the 19th time that Tether had attracted US government action, according to reporting at Protos, a cryptocurrency watchdog outlet.\nThe main product, USDT, is a stablecoin, a cryptocurrency whose value is exactly equivalent to that of the US dollar.\nEl SalvadorEven before relocating and re-incorporating in El Salvador, Tether\u2019s managers apparently exercised significant influence in Bukele\u2019s crypto-happy regime.\nAt the beginning of 2023, the company inked a \u201cseven-figure\u201d deal with Donald Trump Jr to exclusively carry his biweekly livestream show, Triggered.\nLutnick personally owned between $1m and $5m worth of Rumble stock according to his Office of Government Ethics filings.",

    "body": "Uruguay\u2019s former president Jos\u00e9 Mujica, a onetime Marxist guerrilla and flower farmer whose radical brand of democracy, plain-spoken philosophy and simple lifestyle fascinated people around the world, has died. He was 89.\n\nHis death was announced by the current Uruguayan president. Yamand\u00fa Orsi. In a post on social media platform X, Orsi called Mujica a \u201cpresident, activist, guide and leader\u201d. Mujica had been under treatment for cancer of the esophagus since spring 2024, when the disease was diagnosed.\n\nEven as the treatment left him weak and hardly able to eat, Mujica reappeared on the political stage in fall of 2024, campaigning for his leftwing coalition in national elections that vaulted his preferred candidate and protege, Orsi, to the presidency.\n\nIn September of 2024, his doctor reported that radiation had succeeded in eliminating much of Mujica\u2019s tumor. But in January of 2025, his doctor announced that the cancer in his esophagus had returned and spread to his liver. His autoimmune disease and other underlying medical problems led Mujica to decide not to pursue further treatment.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m dying,\u201d Mujica told weekly magazine B\u00fasqueda in what he said would be his final interview. \u201cA warrior has the right to rest.\u201d\n\nDuring his 2010-2015 presidency, Mujica, widely known as \u201cPepe\u201d, oversaw the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world\u2019s most socially liberal democracies. He earned admiration at home and cult status abroad for legalizing marijuana and same-sex marriage, enacting the region\u2019s first sweeping abortion rights law and establishing Uruguay as a leader in alternative energy.\n\nHe sparked global fascination by shunning the presidential palace to live in a tiny farmhouse and donating most of his salary to charity.\n\nIn the 1960s, he co-founded the Marxist-Leninist urban guerrilla movement Tupamaros, which started out robbing from the rich to give to the poor but later escalated its campaign to kidnappings, bombings and assassinations.\n\nDuring those years, Mujica lived a life of derring-do. He sustained multiple gunshot wounds and took part in a mass prison breakout.\n\nBut when the Tupamaros collapsed in 1972, he was recaptured and spent all of Uruguay\u2019s 1973-1985 dictatorship in prison, where he was tortured and spent years in solitary confinement.\n\nAfter his release, he threw himself into politics and in 1989 founded the Movement of Popular Participation (MPP), the largest member of the leftist Broad Front coalition.\n\nElected to Congress in 1995, he became a senator in 2000 and then agriculture minister in Uruguay\u2019s first-ever leftwing government.\n\nHe served just one five-year term as president, in line with Uruguay\u2019s term limits.\n\nMujica had no children and is survived by his wife, Luc\u00eda Topolansky, another former militant.\n\nIn his final interview, Mujica repeatedly answered interview questions with philosophical aphorisms.\n\n\u201cLife is a beautiful adventure and a miracle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are too focused on wealth and not on happiness. We are focused only on doing things and \u2013 before you know it \u2013 life has passed you by.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed reporting",

These conditions include scrutinising supply chains and ownership structures \u2013 a move widely interpreted as targeting Chinese involvement.\n\nBeijing argues the agreement violates the principle that international agreements should not target third countries, noting this is a \u201cbasic principle\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry criticised the agreement in a statement to the Financial Times. It said: \u201cCooperation between states should not be conducted against or to the detriment of the interests of third parties.\u201d\n\nBeijing fears these clauses are designed to pressure allies into excluding Chinese products, in effect isolating China economically.\n\nChina is doubling down on what it calls \u201cdual circulation\u201d \u2013 boosting domestic production and resilience so its economy can thrive. State-backed companies are being pushed to source components locally, and ministries are funnelling support into advanced manufacturing and green technology.\n\nUnder the UK-US deal signed last week the US agreed to reduce tariffs on British car exports from 27.5% to 10%, applicable to a quota of 100,000 vehicles annually. Tariffs on UK steel and aluminium have also been lifted, provided British companies meet strict US security conditions, particularly around supply chain transparency and foreign ownership \u2013 measures that implicitly limit Chinese involvement.\n\nThe deal also includes liberalised quotas for US beef and ethanol exports to the UK, alongside a commitment to explore deeper cooperation in pharmaceuticals and advanced manufacturing, contingent again on UK compliance with US security provisions.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zhang Yansheng, a senior researcher at the China Academy of Macroeconomic Research, said the UK\u2019s actions were \u201cnot fair to China\u201d. He described the deal\u2019s clauses as \u201cpoison pills\u201d that were worse than tariffs.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThis government signed a deal with the US in the national interest to secure thousands of jobs across key sectors, protect British businesses and lay the groundwork for greater trade in the future.\n\n\u201cIn line with our long-term, consistent approach, trade and investment with China remain important to the UK.

    "title": "After chaos of the Yoon era, South Korea prepares to pick a new president",
    "body": "After the unprecedented turmoil of the past six months, South Koreans could be forgiven for breathing a collective sigh of relief that the political focus has shifted from an impeachment crisis to economic policy ahead of next month\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe economy is expected to dominate the campaign to elect a new president on 3 June, after the impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol, whose declaration of martial law in December triggered the South\u2019s most serious political crisis for decades.\n\nAsia\u2019s fourth-biggest economy \u2013 one of the region\u2019s big success stories of recent decades \u2013 is reeling from low growth, a super-ageing society, one of the world\u2019s lowest birthrates and the fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s tariff wars.\n\nThe Yoon debacle cast a long shadow over the campaign when it kicked off this week. The former president, who was ousted after the constitutional court upheld his impeachment last month, made his third appearance in court in a separate criminal trial while senior figures in his conservative People Power party (PPP) clashed over who should run in the election to succeed him.\n\nAfter days of public infighting, the party announced that the former labour minister and hardline conservative Kim Moon-soo, would run. He will be up against Lee Jae-myung, the liberal Democratic party candidate, who leads comfortably in the polls.\n\nLee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022 after a divisive campaign, thanked his supporters for helping him rebuild after the \u201cpainful defeat\u201d three years ago. \u201cI promise to repay their support with victory,\u201d he told a crowd in Seoul.\n\nKim will be hoping to banish memories of Yoon\u2019s botched suspension of civilian rule and prioritise his plans for the economy amid record-high youth unemployment, and a housing and cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\u201cI genuinely believe I must become a president for the people, a president for livelihoods, a president for the economy,\u201d Kim told reporters after launching his campaign at a market in the capital. \u201cI must be a president who ensures the people of South Korea live well.\u201d\n\nLee, meanwhile, is contesting criminal charges that have threatened to disqualify him from the race. His ongoing trials range from alleged bribery to charges mostly linked to a $1bn property development scandal. He has, though, been given breathing room after courts agreed to push back further hearings until after the election. He denies all charges.\n\nKim\u2019s chaotic selection underlined the size of the challenge facing the PPP since Yoon, a conservative populist, attempted to impose martial law to confront what he described as \u201cpro-North Korean\u201d elements in the Democrat-controlled national assembly.\n\nYoon, who was impeached by the assembly two weeks later, was succeeded by two acting presidents while the constitutional court considered his fate. He is on trial on charges of insurrection \u2013 a crime that carries life in prison or the death penalty, although South Korea has not carried out an execution since 1997. Yoon has denied the charges.\n\nKim was initially selected to run for president in early May, only for his candidacy to be cancelled as senior party figures attempted to replace him with the former prime minister, Han Duck-soo, whom they said had a better chance of defeating the resurgent Lee.\n\nParty members voted down the attempted coup and Kim was reinstated, amid warnings that infighting would hand Lee an easy victory.\n\nEven PPP supporters said they were dismayed by the party\u2019s preparations for the election. \u201cThe PPP is just a mess. They are self-destructing,\u201d said Lee Jung-ja, a 52-year-old voter. \u201cEven if they unite, it still won\u2019t be enough. All they\u2019re doing is fighting with each other. I bet Lee Jae-myung is gloating.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Kim said he would demand an immediate summit with Donald Trump to negotiate tariffs and take a hard line against nuclear-armed North Korea. He has promised to create a more business-friendly environment to encourage private investment and to increase housing support for young people and newly married couples.\n\nLee has campaigned in a bulletproof vest following claims by Democratic party lawmakers that they had received text messages warning of an assassinate plot. They claimed he was being targeted by former operatives from a covert South Korean military unit that operated when the country was ruled by authoritarian regimes from the 1960s to the 1980s.\n\nLee, who was stabbed in the neck during a press conference in January 2024, referred to the unusual precaution, telling supporters that South Korean society was \u201cnow so fractured that a presidential candidate must campaign in a bulletproof vest\u201d.\n\nLee has said he will boost economic growth through AI and the Korean culture wave \u2013 a major driver of exports and inbound tourism \u2013 and offer tax incentives to encourage couples to have more children.\n\nLike previous liberal candidates, he has vowed to restart a dialogue with North Korea, despite the regime\u2019s development of nuclear weapons and military alliance with Russia.\n\nIn an editorial, the Korea Herald noted that Yoon\u2019s impeachment had left little time for debate and urged South Koreans to \u201cresist partisan reflexes\u201d.\n\nThe newspaper said: \u201cThe next president will inherit more than a fractured government. They will inherit the responsibility to restore institutional trust, re-anchor the economy and navigate an increasingly volatile global order. The task ahead is formidable.\u201d\n\nWith less than three weeks until the election, one poll gave Lee a lead over Kim of 43% to 29%, while another put Lee on 49.5% and Kim on 38.2%",

An application for parental rights over a second girl from the north-east, who was born in March 2023, was also turned down.\n\nIn both cases, he had sex with the women. It was a \u201cfree\u201d service, which Albon on his Facebook page said meant recipients did not have to \u201chave a weirdo in a lab coat look at your hoohaw\u201d.\n\nIn the case of the three-year-old, the mother contacted him over Facebook in 2021, and he asked her to send a picture before travelling 250 miles the same day for sex. The woman already had seven children, five of whom were not in her care.\n\nAfterwards, Albon exchanged messages with the woman, who later wrote: \u201cHave done an awful lot of thinking about how you have treated me. I can\u2019t eat. I actually came within minutes of ending my life this morning. It was my 17-year-old that stopped me. I cannot carry on any longer. You have truly broken me.\u201d\n\nIn messages, she accused him of using the unborn child to try to get benefits and a house.\n\nIn the case of the two-year-old girl, Albon did not appear on the child\u2019s birth certificate, though he initially had some contact with her.\n\nAlbon applied for declaration of parentage, parental responsibility and contact with the girl, which the mother opposed, giving evidence in court from behind a screen.\n\nThe woman, who was described as \u201csuggestible\u201d by the judge, learned his name was Robert, and not Joe, only after the child was born. She was described by social services as being vulnerable, having a very unstable family background and was assessed to have an IQ of 75.\n\nAlbon, who has families with a Japanese woman and a Chinese woman he is estranged from, has also fathered dozens of children across South America, Australia and the UK.\n\nIn the US, where he was offering sperm donor services until 2017, there is a warrant for his arrest over unpaid child maintenance amounting to thousands of dollars.\n\nIn an interview with the Sun last August, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve had about 180 live births and I\u2019ve met about 60 of them.\u201d",

    "title": "\u2018Turning point\u2019: claw print fossils found in Australia rewrite story of amniotes by 40 million years",
    "body": "Fossilised claw prints found in Australia suggest amniotes \u2013 the ancestors of reptiles, birds and mammals \u2013 evolved about 40m years earlier than thought.\n\nThe footprints, in sandstone dated 354m to 358m years old, were probably made by reptiles crossing a surface dimpled by raindrops. Researchers said the trackways represent the oldest evidence of amniotes on the planet.\n\n\u201cThe implications are profound,\u201d said Flinders University palaeontologist Prof John Long, lead author of the paper, published in Nature. \u201cIt\u2019s rewriting the story of the amniotes \u2013 evolving much earlier than people had thought.\u201d\n\nThe discovery also hinted at their emergence in the ancient southern continent of Gondwana, rather than in the northern hemisphere, he said. The trackways were much older than previous amniote fossils and tracks \u2013 from Europe and North America \u2013 dated to about 318 million years ago, as well as an earlier example identified by the authors in the course of their research.\n\nFossil hunters Craig Eury and John Eason found the footprints on the banks of the Broken River near the town of Mansfield, on Taungurung country, 200km north-east of Melbourne.\n\nLong, whose connection to fossils of the area stretches back 45 years, has kept in contact with a \u201clocal band of dedicated Mansfield locals\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Flinders University palaeontologist Prof John Long. Photograph: Traci Klarenbeek\n\nHe said he was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d when Eason sent him an email with a photograph of the find, asking: \u201cIs this anything?\u201d\n\nWhen the photo opened on his screen, he said: \u201cIt was a beautiful set of not one but a couple of different sets of trackways criss-crossing the slab.\u201d\n\nAn ancient rain shower had pockmarked the slab\u2019s surface, indicating exposed ground. Later, reptilian track makers came through, leaving five-toed prints, some with imprints of claws, and scratch marks from digging.\n\nDetailed investigations by Flinders University specialists in CT scanning and trackways, and world experts in early tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) tracks at Uppsala University in Sweden, confirmed the significance of the find.\n\nThe discovery pushed back the arrival of amniotes to the early carboniferous, a period named for the rich coal beds that formed in the northern hemisphere at the time, Long said.\n\nThe period was a \u201cturning point\u201d in the Earth\u2019s history, he said. Oxygen levels were high and huge forests dominated the land. Swamps were full of amphibians, some up to five metres in length, and huge sharks invaded the rivers. A great diversity of animals and plants started appearing \u2013 bony fishes and seed-bearing trees.\n\n\u201cIt was really a changing of the guard from the archaic fishes and plants that characterised the first half of the palaeozoic era, to the kind of assemblages that would dominate right through to today.\u201d\n\nThat included the amniotes \u2013 defined by the amniotic membrane that allowed them to lay eggs or reproduce outside of water \u2013 adapted for life on the land.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting story for Australian science,\u201d Long said. \u201cIt hints there\u2019s a lot more work to do [and] a lot more field work. Now we\u2019ve got the footprints we need to find the bones of these things.\u201d\n\nDr Erich Fitzgerald, a senior curator of vertebrate palaeontology at Museums Victoria Research Institute, who was not involved in the study, said it was a \u201cprovocative discovery with potentially far-reaching implications\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat we need next is to find body fossils \u2013 bones from these rocks \u2013 that can confirm the presence of amniotes so long ago.\u201d\n\nFitzgerald said the discovery of the trackway highlighted the importance of \u201cAustralia\u2019s spectacular fossil record\u201d, much of which was relatively understudied, and revealed the importance of collaboration between professional scientists and keen members of the public.\n\n\u201cThis is a jaw-droppingly beautiful example of the importance of continuing to search for and collect new fossils,\u201d he said. \u201cPalaeontology is still in the process of unravelling the mysteries of the evolution of life \u2026 and the evolution of us.\u201d\n\n",

Photograph: CHOICE\n\nJana Bowden, a marketing professor at Macquarie University, said the issue was not limited to major chains, pointing to her recent discovery that a local chemist was charging her elderly neighbour double the price a big competitor would have.\n\n\u201cMany pharmacies prey on consumer complacency,\u201d Bowden said. \u201cBright sales tags, stickers, and promotional flags trick consumers into thinking there\u2019s a sale to be had.\u201d\n\nClare Mullen, executive director at Western Australia\u2019s Health Consumers\u2019 Council, said the alleged practice could be particularly concerning where consumers were seeking medical products to treat health issues.\n\n\u201cGoing into some of these places is a visual assault,\u201d Mullen said.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about health-related items, it\u2019s just unfair that the onus is on the consumer to put in the extra effort.\u201d\n\nOne Terry White store analysed in the research sold a tube of toothpaste discounted to $6 from a recommended $11.99, despite the typical price being only $8.99, Choice said. Seven in 10 survey respondents believed they were getting a $5.99 saving on the product\u2019s usual price \u2013 double the actual saving.\n\nPriceline labels included phrases such as \u201cgreat value\u201d and \u201clower prices\u201d next to some products\u2019 existing sale prices without directly claiming a discount.\n\nAustralia\u2019s consumer watchdog has said businesses must not mislead customers, including by offering a displayed price against a recommended retail price the product had never been sold at.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I know you and the Australian government endeavour to do your utmost to bring me home for medical care and reunification with my family.\u201d\n\nYang, who has stated he is \u201c100% innocent\u201d, has previously told supporters he feared he could die in a prison cell from a worsening medical condition he says has not been treated properly. His friends fear he may not survive his incarceration.\n\nYang\u2019s letter thanked Australia\u2019s ambassador to China, Scott Dewar, and diplomatic staff who have continued to visit him in prison, called for his release and passed messages from his family in Australia.\n\n\u201cAll of this solicitude and solace has helped me to bear what has been untold and unbearable suffering,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThey are not family, and yet they are more than family. How could words articulate my emotions?\n\n\u201cI feel all of your support beside me as I stagger through the hardest and darkest chapter of my life, allowing me to immerse in the warmth of humanity.\n\n\u201cIt has helped me to understand the value of words and deeds of a government of the people, by the people, for the people \u2013 to enable me to fully understand the true meaning of being an Australian citizen.\u201d\n\nYang was arrested in 2019 at Guangzhou airport, accused of spying for an undisclosed foreign country. The 57-year-old pro-democracy blogger is an Australian citizen who was born in China. He was tried in a one-day, closed-door hearing in Beijing in May 2021, with a verdict not publicly disclosed.\n\nThe foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said she and the prime minister were deeply moved by the letter, describing it as \u201ca message of profound courage, resilience and hope despite extraordinarily difficult circumstances\u201d.\n\n\u201cDr Yang writes of his great love for his country \u2013 and we want to see him home in Australia, reunited with his family,\u201d Wong said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe continue to advocate for Dr Yang\u2019s interests and wellbeing at every opportunity and at the highest levels, including access to appropriate medical care.

I cherish and defend its core values. This is something I\u2019ve sought for in my life, it is bigger than my own life.\u201d\n\nIn March last year, Wong told her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, during his visit to Canberra, that Australians were \u201cshocked\u201d at Yang\u2019s suspended death sentence.\n\n\u201cI made clear to him the Australian government will continue to advocate on Dr Yang\u2019s behalf,\u201d Wong said at a media conference after the 2024 meeting.\n\nThe sentence is formally described as a death sentence with a two-year reprieve. It is a relatively common ruling that allows death sentences to be commuted to 25 years, or life in prison after two years of good behaviour. China is believed to be the world\u2019s biggest user of the death penalty, but there is no publicly available data. China\u2019s court system is notoriously opaque, with conviction rates above 99.9% and very few cases overturned for wrongful convictions.\n\nChina has maintained the case was held in accordance with its legal system.",

    "body": "Content creator Hannah Ferguson has used her first press club speech to call for stronger rules around transparency and accountability for paid content \u2013 and announce plans to run for parliament at the next election.\n\nWhile criticising traditional media for perceived bias on Wednesday \u2013 and pointing the finger directly at the Murdoch press \u2013 Ferguson also acknowledged social media should be regulated for its political content.\n\n\u201cI believe that there should be structural accountability for people online \u2026 there\u2019s guidelines to be changed [and] I think there should be enforceable standards,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe have to have frameworks in place to regulate this kind of work. But regulation should be uniform. Let\u2019s force the Murdoch media to do the same.\u201d\n\nFerguson is the co-founder and CEO of youth media platform Cheek Media Co, which publishes short reels on politics attracting tens of thousands of views. She curated a distinctive progressive voice on social media during the election campaign, and was part of a growing wave of content creators who dominated the social media space in the lead-up to the 2025 vote. She also hosts a podcast Big Small Talk and, between her personal and Cheek Media pages, has a combined following of about 275,000.\n\nAfter Ferguson was invited to cover the federal budget earlier this year alongside other creators \u2013 some of whom had travel expenses covered \u2013 she was criticised by some media outlets.\n\nHighlighting in her first speech that she had not accepted payment for political content during the election, she later said she was \u201cconcerned\u201d about being \u201clumped together\u201d with paid creators.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018no\u2019 to money from multiple political organisations that offered it to me this election cycle, and that was why so much of it was offensive, because I actively ensured I was a commentator that was freed from [bias] \u2026 Everything was my bias, but I was forthcoming with this.\u201d\n\nFerguson backed a royal commission into Australia\u2019s media concentration, but going even further than one proposed by the former prime minister and current US ambassador, Kevin Rudd.\n\n\u201cA government that will pass a world-first ban on social media for under-16s should establish a royal commission into Australia\u2019s media concentration,\u201d she said, \u201cexamining not only Murdoch, but the entire industry, including unregulated space and social media for which I form part.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to the new media landscape, she suggested \u201ca lot of tests need to be put in place\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an expert but I think in the media landscape there needs to be a fit and proper person test. At a social media level, there needs to be clear regulations and guidance when it comes to authorisations, endorsements, collaborative posting,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not really that many limitations to who can advertise on different forms of media and what they can say and how they can lie.\u201d\n\nThe room on Wednesday was filled with young women, some within the political space, including Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young (who Ferguson endorsed to become the next leader of the minor party) and members of independent senator David Pocock\u2019s office.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Breaking News Australia Free newsletter Get the most important news as it breaks Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "body": "Denmark is reconsidering its 40-year ban on nuclear power in a major policy shift for the renewables-heavy country.\n\nThe Danish government will analyse the potential benefits of a new generation of nuclear power technologies after banning traditional nuclear reactors in 1985, its energy minister said.\n\nThe Scandinavian country is one of Europe\u2019s most renewables-rich energy markets and home to \u00d8rsted, the world\u2019s biggest offshore wind company. More than 80% of its electricity is generated from renewables, including wind, biofuels and solar, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nBut Denmark may begin investing in modular nuclear reactors too, Lars Aagaard, the energy and climate minister, suggested.\n\nAagaard told the Danish newspaper Politiken: \u201cWe can see that there is a development under way with new nuclear power technologies \u2013 small, modular reactors. But it\u2019s not enough that they have potential. We also need to know what it means for Danish society if we are to enable these technologies.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s decision to reconsider nuclear power has emerged as interest in new nuclear reactor designs has picked up across Europe, alongside plans to extend the lifespan of the continent\u2019s existing reactors.\n\nDenmark\u2019s former prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the Financial Times on Wednesday he supported lifting the \u201cridiculous\u201d ban on nuclear power.\n\n\u201cWind and solar are good as long as you have wind and sunshine. But you have to have a non-fossil base-load and it\u2019s ridiculous to exclude nuclear power in advance. My guess is that this is a process [from the government] towards lifting the ban,\u201d he said.\n\nRenewed European interest in nuclear power is in part because of an expected increase in demand for low-carbon electricity to decarbonise transport, industry and home heating in the decades ahead.\n\nThe developers of small modular reactor designs, which can be built in factories and assembled on site, have promised lower costs and shorter construction times than traditional large-scale reactors.\n\nNuclear power has also won the backing of tech companies, including Google, which are interested in using small modular nuclear reactors to supply their energy-hungry datacentres with consistent 24-hour electricity.\n\nSpain, widely considered anti-nuclear, is understood to be reconsidering plans to shut down its seven nuclear reactors in the next decade after a massive power outage across the Iberian peninsula last month.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, it cancelled one of the UK\u2019s largest offshore windfarms, Hornsea 4, off the Yorkshire coast, saying soaring costs meant it no longer made economic sense.",

Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told journalists in Moscow that he would announce the composition of the Russian delegation \u201conce we receive the relevant instructions from the president\u201d. \u201cSo far, no such instructions have been given,\u201d he added. Zelenskyy challenged Putin to a personal meeting in Turkey after the Russian leader used an unexpected late-night Kremlin address to call for direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Istanbul.

In Istanbul, Ukraine is expected to call for a full 30-day ceasefire as a starting point for further talks. Moscow has consistently rejected extended ceasefire proposals, arguing they would give Ukraine time to rearm and regroup at a moment when Russian forces are advancing on the battlefield. Russian officials have indicated they will press for maximalist demands in Istanbul, similar to those made during the failed round of talks in Turkey in spring 2022. European leaders have promised to increase pressure on Russia if the talks in Turkey failed, but the key question remains whether they can bring Donald Trump onboard with their efforts to tighten the screws on Moscow. Kremlin tight-lipped for third day on whether Putin will meet Zelenskyy Read more Share\n\n5h ago 16.37 CEST German chancellor Friedrich Merz pledged on Wednesday to build up \u201cthe strongest conventional army in Europe\u201d as the continent faces a hostile Russia while the Ukraine war rages on, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThis is appropriate for Europe\u2019s most populous and economically powerful country,\u201d Merz told parliament. \u201cOur friends and partners also expect this from us. Indeed, they practically demand it.\u201d In his first major address to the Bundestag since his government was inaugurated last week, Merz vowed to \u201cprovide all financial means necessary\u201d for the long-underfunded defence forces. \u201cOur goal is a Germany and a Europe that are so strong together that we never have to use our weapons,\u201d Merz said. \u201cTo achieve this, we will have to assume more responsibility within Nato and the EU.\u201d US president Donald Trump has demanded that Germany and other allies spend more on common defence and thrown into doubt Washington\u2019s future commitment to the transatlantic military alliance.

The German federal prosecutor\u2019s office said on Wednesday that the men, identified only as Vladyslav T, Daniil B and Yevhen B, in line with German privacy rules, had been detained in recent days in Germany and Switzerland.

He makes clear that Germany will continue on the course of the previous government to support Ukraine against its aggressor, Russia. \u201cRussia has broken all the rules that have governed our coexistence in Europe since the end of the Second World War, and above all, since overcoming the division of Europe,\u201d he says. What\u2019s going on in Ukraine, he adds, makes clear that \u201cnothing less than the peaceful order of our entire continent is at stake. In this historic moment of decisiveness, Europe must stand closer together than ever.\u201d For more than three years, \u201cRussia\u2019s war of aggression has been raging in Ukraine.\u201d The outcome of the war, he says, will not only determine the fate of Ukraine, but also \u201cwhether law and order will continue to prevail in Europe and the world, or whether tyranny, military force and the naked right of the strongest will prevail.\u201d He pledges to continue Germany\u2019s military support of Ukraine, but also to turn Germany\u2019s national military, the Bundeswehr, into the strongest conventional army in Europe by consistently expanding it and investing the necessary resources in it. \u201cWe want to be in a position to be able to defend ourselves so that we\u2019re not in a position of having to defend ourselves\u201d. \u201cStrength deters, weakness invites aggression,\u201d he added, to applause in the full chamber, adding that for Europe\u2019s most populous and economically strongest country, this is \u201cnothing more than appropriate.\u201d After thanking Germany\u2019s armed forces, he announced the introduction of a \u201cnew, attractive, voluntary military service to meet the personnel needs of the armed forces\u201d. We expect more details on this new development to follow.

Based on his response, the Ukrainian leadership will decide on the next steps,\u201d the source said. If Putin agrees to join, it would be the first meeting between the leaders of the two warring countries since December 2019. Direct talks between negotiators from Ukraine and Russia last took place in Istanbul in March 2022, a month after Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.

The EU on Wednesday approved a fresh package of sanctions on Russia (see 8.57am BST), but Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot sadi that multiple rounds of punitive measures have failed to halt Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, now in its fourth year. \u201cWe will have to go further, because these massive sanctions have not yet deterred Vladimir Putin from continuing his war of aggression against Ukraine,\u201d Barrot told broadcaster BFMTV. He said: We must prepare to impose devastating sanctions that could suffocate the Russian economy once and for all. Barrot said that he was to meet US Senator Lindsey Graham in Turkey on Thursday to discuss a US sanctions bill he was working on. Graham has rallied dozens of lawmakers to support a plan to impose additional sanctions on Moscow as well as tariffs on countries that buy Russian energy. Graham \u201chas designed a package of extremely powerful sanctions\u201d, with tariffs of 500% on countries that continue to import Russian oil, the French foreign minister said. \u201cRussia has found ways to circumvent the blockade imposed by Europe and the United States,\u201d Barrot said. \u201cTurning off the tap in this way is a way of grabbing Russia by the throat,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope that Europe will in turn be able to impose sanctions on hydrocarbons,\u201d Barrot said.

    "body": "Tom Cruise got stuck on the wing of a biplane shortly before it ran out fuel during the filming of Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning, the director of the eighth instalment of the action franchise has revealed.\n\nSpeaking to an audience at the Cannes film festival hours before the film\u2019s premiere, director Christopher McQuarrie recounted the filming of a stunt sequence in which Cruise, in his long-running role as the field agent Ethan Hunt, walked between between the two wings of a biplane as the aircraft was mid-air over South Africa.\n\nCruise, who at 62 continues to insist on performing his own stunts, had himself come up with the action sequence where he would float \u201czero-G\u201d between the wings of the plane and dismissed the initial warnings of professional wing-walking stuntmen, said McQuarrie, who has directed the actor in the last four Mission: Impossibles as well as the Jack Reacher series of action films.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018We could not tell if he was conscious or not\u2019 \u2026 Cruise acknowledges fans at Cannes on Wednesday. Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/Reuters\n\nWing-walking is extremely risky because the human body starts to break down after about 12 minutes due to the impact of wind at extreme speed and the difficulty of breathing in dispersed molecules, explained the director, who was overseeing the stunt from a helicopter flying alongside. \u201cIt\u2019s literally like two hours in the gym.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Cruise had signalled to McQuarrie that he wanted to continue filming after the 12-minute mark had passed.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment where Tom had pushed himself to the point that he was so physically exhausted, he couldn\u2019t get back up off the wing,\u201d McQuarrie said, speaking alongside Cruise in an on-stage interview at Cannes. \u201cHe was lying on the wing of the plane, his arms were hanging over the front. We could not tell if he was conscious or not.\u201d\n\nIn McQuarrie\u2019s telling, the pilot communicated at this point that the plane had only three minutes\u2019 worth of fuel remaining, but that the plane couldn\u2019t have landed with the actor lying prone on the wing.\n\n\u201cWe watched Tom as he pulled himself up and stuck his head in the cockpit, so that he could replenish the oxygen in his body and then climb up into the cockpit\u201d, McQuarrie said. \u201cNo one on earth can do that but Tom.\u201d\n\nCruise, who swooped into the Palais de Festivals as part of a multi-stop promotional tour also including stops in Japan, Korea and London, talked up his prowess as he joined the director on stage. \u201cI don\u2019t mind encountering the unknown,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an emotion for me and it\u2019s something that is not paralysing.\u201d.\n\nMcQuarrie, who first made a mark in Hollywood as the scriptwriter behind 1995 cult thriller The Usual Suspects, bemoaned that the US film industry in its current state was \u201cdriving a wedge through cinema\u201d by increasingly forcing film-makers to choose between seeing themselves as artists or as entertainers.\n\nHe questioned the claims of streaming giants to be \u201csaving Hollywood\u201d, saying that Netflix and co were \u201ccutting the audience off from the history of cinema\u201d by prioritising their own productions over classic films on their home pages.\n\n\u201cThe number of people I meet who have never heard of The Best Years of Our Lives, who have never heard of William Wyler\u2019s The Big Country, who have never seen Cool Hand Luke, and whose history of cinema begins at Star Wars or Pirates of the Caribbean.\u201d",

    "body": "Three Ukrainian nationals have been arrested on suspicion of plotting parcel bomb attacks in Germany on behalf of the Russian state, according to prosecutors, reviving fears about an alleged Moscow-engineered sabotage campaign in Europe.\n\nAfter the detonation of several parcels at European cargo centres last year, the German investigation drew comparisons with incidents believed to be part of a wave of hybrid attacks against western countries since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe German federal prosecutor\u2019s office said on Wednesday that the men, identified only as Vladyslav T, Daniil B and Yevhen B, in line with German privacy rules, had been detained in recent days in Germany and Switzerland.\n\nThey are accused of \u201csecret agent activity for sabotage purposes\u201d and of agreeing by, at the latest, March 2025 \u201cwith one or several persons presumed to be working for Russian state institutions\u201d to carry out \u201caggravated arson\u201d and \u201ccause a detonation using explosives\u201d.\n\nThe prosecutors alleged the men\u2019s intent had been to carry out \u201cexplosives attacks on cargo transport in the Federal Republic of Germany\u201d by shipping parcels from Germany to recipients in Ukraine carrying \u201cexplosives or incendiary devices\u201d that would \u201cdetonate during transport\u201d.\n\nVladyslav T allegedly sent two test packages containing GPS trackers in late March from Cologne, in western Germany, \u201cto scout out suitable transport routes\u201d on the orders of Yevhen B, who is believed to have provided the package contents via Daniil B.\n\nThe federal criminal police have been carrying out the investigation owing to its \u201cspecial significance\u201d, as is common in suspected terrorism cases. The news magazine Der Spiegel cited sources close to the investigation as saying that the plot had been at an early stage.\n\nRegional officials said it was the test runs that had brought the plans to the attention of security authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia state. Its interior minister, Herbert Reul, said the arrests pointed to the \u201chybrid threat\u201d posed by \u201clow-level agents\u201d working for Russian services for \u201clittle money\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe know that Russia is trying to destabilise western democracies by all means \u2013 including targeted sabotage and perfidious intelligence methods,\u201d the German justice minister, Stefanie Hubig, said, adding that security authorities were \u201ckeeping a close eye on this threat\u201d.\n\nThe chancellor, Friedrich Merz, did not mention the arrests during his first speech to parliament since taking office last week. But he condemned murders, cyber-attacks and destruction of undersea data cables across Europe \u201cthat are overwhelmingly the work of the Russian state leadership and its helpers\u201d.\n\nMerz called such plots \u201cattempts to sow division\u201d and said Germany and Europe would meet these security threats \u201cwith the greatest decisiveness, with unity and above all with defence preparedness\u201d.\n\nGermany is the second-largest national supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States and Merz has pledged his government\u2019s unwavering support of Kyiv.\n\nLast July, European security agencies were shaken by three separate explosions in packages sent from Lithuania, which detonated in Birmingham in the UK; Leipzig, Germany; and near Warsaw, in Poland.\n\nAll the couriers appear to have operated within the same network and transported similar content of sex toys and massage pillows.\n\nReuters reported that the devices were rigged to ignite using pre-set timers repurposed from inexpensive Chinese electronics typically used for tracking lost items. Their impact was intensified by tubes disguised as cosmetics, which were filled with a flammable gel containing compounds such as nitromethane.\n\nWestern security officials were quick to suspect Russian intelligence, with the incidents coming amid a series of other hostile acts.\n\nGerman authorities said in October that a plane could have been downed if the devices had ignited in flight. Security officials noted the parcels were due to have been in the air when they caught fire and the delayed arrival of the aircraft had prevented a catastrophe.\n\nThe logistics firm DHL took measures to protect its network after fires at one of its warehouses in Leipzig.\n\nWhen the US government became aware of the alleged plot, alarmed officials in Joe Biden\u2019s White House reportedly contacted their Russian counterparts to demand the Kremlin put a stop to it.\n\nRussia has denied any involvement.\n\nRichard Moore, the head of the UK\u2019s Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6, warned in November that Russia was waging a \u201cstaggeringly reckless campaign\u201d of sabotage in Europe while also increasing its nuclear sabre-rattling to scare off other countries from backing Ukraine.",

The ABA sued the justice department in April, claiming it illegally terminated federal grants in retaliation for the organization\u2019s public criticism of the Trump administration. US district judge Christopher Cooper granted the ABA\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction to stop the government from terminating the grants as the case moves forward. \u201cThe first amendment injury is concrete and ongoing,\u201d Cooper wrote in his opinion on Wednesday. The ABA regularly engages in protected expressive activity, and DOJ\u2019s termination of its grants directly punishes that activity.

Hundreds of thousands of people could lose access to Medicaid, Shapiro told WILK-FM radio on Wednesday. He said: I just need to stress: there is no back-filling at the state level. There are no dollars available at the state level to make up for these cuts at the federal level. So if they cut someone off Medicaid, they\u2019re off. We will not be able to fix that for them.

The plans include an $18bn cut to National Institutes of Health funding and $3.6bn from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kennedy, appearing before the House appropriations committee this morning, argued the proposed cuts would save taxpayers $1.8bn per year and make the department more efficient. He said in his opening statement: Our reductions have focused on aligning HHS staffing levels to reflect the size of HHS prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw around a 15% increase in the number of employees. Asked about Elon Musk\u2019s involvement in the cuts and firings at his department, Kennedy said: Ultimately, we executed the decisions, but Elon Musk gave us help in trying and figuring out where there was fraud and abuse in the department. But it was up to me to make the decision, and there are many instances where I pushed back.

One provision in the bill, which runs nearly 400 pages, seeks to raise the child tax credit from the current $2,000 level to $2,500 per child \u2013 but an estimated 17 million children would be ineligible to receive the full credit because their parents do not make enough to qualify, according to a congressional estimate. Another provision of the bill would require a US citizen child\u2019s parent or guardian to possess a social security number in order to claim the credit; if the child\u2019s parents are married and file their taxes together, both parents would need social security numbers. This requirement would make undocumented immigrants and other immigrants who lack work authorization ineligible to claim the credit on behalf of children who are US citizens or legal permanent residents, stripping the benefit from a number of families who would otherwise receive it. Under current requirements, families of children with social security numbers are eligible regardless of the parents\u2019 status.

Khan Suri was among several individuals legally studying in the US who have been targeted by the Trump administration for their pro-Palestinian activism. He has spent two months in detention. US district judge Patricia Giles in Alexandria, Virginia, said that the ruling is effective immediately with no conditions and no bond. The Trump administration had ordered the detention of Khan Suri, a citizen of India, on 17 March. He was previously being held at an immigration prison in Alvarado, Texas. Immigration officials revoked his J-1 student visa, alleging his father-in-law was an adviser to Hamas officials more than a decade ago in addition to claims that he was \u201cdeportable\u201d because of his posts on social media in support of Palestine. Khan Suri, who is married to a Palestinian-American US citizen, Mapheze Saleh, is a senior postdoctoral fellow at the institution\u2019s Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU). Many students and alumni of the institution signed a letter opposing his detention by Ice. Giles prohibited federal officials in March from deporting the postdoctoral fellow after his wife filed an emergency court request to prevent deportation.

It has a tail as tall as an average six-storey city building, is the \u201cworld\u2019s fastest commercial jet\u201d and is capable, theoretically, of transporting 10,767 solid gold bars from Fort Knox. What Boeing\u2019s marketing spiel doesn\u2019t mention is that the 747-8 is also capable of serving as a giant flying metaphor for corruption, after it emerged that Qatar planned to gift one of the $400m planes to the Trump administration, with Donald Trump planning to use it as Air Force One before handing it over to his presidential library. Amid criticism, the president initially defended the move as a money-saving effort. But in the days following it has become clear that another thing was on his mind: that other people have big planes, and he wants one too. The transaction actually makes little sense financially. Experts told NBC News that converting the 747 into Air Force One would cost more than $1bn and take \u201cyears\u201d to complete \u2013 potentially not even being ready by the end of Trump\u2019s term.

El Salvador also plays host to a booming cryptocurrency and new media industry, which has numerous ties to Donald Trump allies who are seeking to make money from various ventures which have sometimes drawn the attention of authorities or ethics watchdogs. Securities and Exchange Commission and Office of Government Ethics (OGE) filings, along with public records in the US and El Salvador, indicate that Cantor Fitzgerald, the firm Lutnick headed until weeks ago before handing off to a management team including two of his sons, holds an effective 5% stake in the cryptocurrency firm Tether, has negotiated several investments on behalf of the highly profitable company, and is custodian of the US treasury holdings from which those profits arise.

When you land and you see Saudi Arabia, you see UAE and you see Qatar, and they have these brand-new Boeing 747s, mostly. You see ours next to it \u2013 this is like a totally different plane. Clearly irritated by questions about the ethical criticism of accepting such a lavish gift as president, Trump insisted American prestige was at stake. We\u2019re the United States of America. I believe we should have the most impressive plane. The timing of Trump\u2019s visit has raised eyebrows, coming just weeks after the Trump Organization secured a deal with Qatar for a luxury resort and golf course development outside the capital, Doha, called Trump International Golf Club & Villas. \u201cMy attitude is why wouldn\u2019t I accept a gift?\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWe\u2019re giving to everybody else, why wouldn\u2019t I accept a gift? Because it\u2019s going to be a couple years until the Boeings are finished.\u201d Trump was referring to the incoming Air Force One fleet, a $3.9bn contract given to Boeing in 2018 with an original timetable of 2024 that has since been delayed by a number of years. The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, who worked as a lobbyist for Qatar while at her previous employer Ballard Partners, has reportedly declared accepting the aircraft \u201clegally permissible\u201d.

Major figures in Venezuela\u2019s government, which is under extensive US sanctions, had repeatedly called for Maikelys Antonella Espinoza Bernal, aged 2, to be returned to her mother, Yorely Bernal, who was deported back to Venezuela in April. Last month the foreign ministry went as far as accusing the US of \u201ckidnapping\u201d the child. Images on state television showed first lady Cilia Flores holding the child in her arms at the international airport near Caracas. The toddler\u2019s return has been \u201ca battle every day and today we have a great victory,\u201d said interior minister Diosdado Cabello, who was also at the airport. Her parents had entered the US in May 2024 seeking asylum, and had been in immigrant detention during their entire stay in the country after turning themselves in at the border. Meanwhile their little girl was placed in the care of a foster family via the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the US. The baby\u2019s father, Maiker Espinoza, 25, was sent to Cecot, the notorious maximum security prison in El Salvador where the Trump administration has sent at least 137 Venezuelans under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, in March. The department of homeland security (DHS) denied that it had kidnapped the child and said she was removed from the deportation flight list \u201cfor her safety and welfare\u201d, claiming without evidence in late-April that Espinoza is a member the Venezuela gang Tren De Aragua. Espinoza\u2019s family roundly denied the claim to Reuters. \u201cAt no time has my son been involved with [Tren de Aragua],\u201d his mother, Maria Escalona, told Reuters this month. \u201cI think this is political - they are using the case of my son to cover up the horror that is being committed against all these innocents.\u201d DHS said the child\u2019s mother Bernal recruited young women for drug smuggling and sex work, though it also provided no evidence. The family has also denied the claim. She was deported without her child \u2013 it is unclear if Bernal was given the choice to be deported with her daughter.

    "title": "Israel\u2019s \u2018no hunger in Gaza\u2019 narrative flies in face of obvious evidence",
    "body": "For many decades, Israel was proud of its officials\u2019 ability to defend and argue and convince around the world. The war in Gaza has seen the country\u2019s public diplomacy face its greatest test \u2013 as was made clear on Wednesday morning with a robust exchange between David Mencer, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, and Nick Robinson, a presenter of the BBC\u2019s flagship Today programme.\n\nMencer stressed that he was speaking on behalf of the prime minister and made an uncompromising statement of Israel\u2019s arguments, including the accusation that Hamas \u2013 described as a \u201cgenocidal death cult\u201d \u2013 uses civilians as human shields.\n\n\u201cIsrael faces a moral paradox right now. It\u2019s been created by Hamas. We have an opportunity to strike every military target, but when we do, we get condemned, you know, or we don\u2019t strike them, and we reward the use of human shields,\u201d he told Robinson.\n\nBut the core of the confrontation was Israel\u2019s blockade of Gaza. Here some listeners may have decided Mencer was involved in a deliberate attempt to obscure the reliably reported reality on the ground for political, ideological and strategic ends.\n\nCertainly, the key Israeli argument that there is \u201cno hunger in Gaza\u201d is hard to sustain. The same goes for Mencer\u2019s accompanying claim that there is food in Gaza, and that markets are open.\n\nIt is true that there are some basics still available in the territory, even after 11 weeks of a total blockade by Israel, and that a few stalls and shops still offer some basics. But the vast majority of the 2.3 million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip cannot afford to buy what they need to survive, and , if they could, stocks would suffice only for a tiny number.\n\nThere is a limited amount of often spoiled flour, of which a standard 25kg sack costs hundreds of dollars, and of fresh food such as potatoes and tomatoes, a kilo of which costs between $10 and $15. There is no dairy and almost no meat. Free bakeries shut weeks ago for lack of fuel and flour, while community kitchens which once served 1m meals a day are closing fast. Almost all the main warehouses run by big international NGOs, such as the World Food Programme or Unrwa, are now empty.\n\nMany people are living on canned peas or dried beans, of which there is a finite supply.\n\nThere are, however, thousands of tonnes of food, medicine, shelter, fuel and everything else necessary for survival ready to be sent into Gaza, but that can happen only when Israel opens the checkpoints it controls along its perimeter.\n\nIt is true, as Mencer said, that a substantial amount of aid was brought in and stockpiled during the 10-week ceasefire that came into effect in mid-January, but this has all gone \u2013 and this influx did not offset the consequences of a war that has devastated agriculture, water supplies, sanitation systems and health services, leaving the population gravely weakened and vulnerable to disease.\n\nEssential medicines used to treat malnutrition are now being rationed, aid workers say, and medical supplies are running low.\n\nThen there is the obvious evidence of images of clearly malnourished people \u2013 often children. Mencer suggested that such cases may not be proof that thousands or tens of thousands of others are in the same dire condition, but a report on Monday from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a consortium of experts that has for decades advised the UN and governments, said that Palestinians living there faced \u201ca critical risk of famine\u201d.\n\nThe IPC, which has developed a five-level famine warning system, found that between 1 April and 10 May this year, 244,000 people in Gaza were in the most critical food security situation: level five, \u201ccatastrophe/famine\u201d. The IPC noted that there had been a \u201cmajor deterioration\u201d in the food security situation in Gaza since its last assessment in October 2024.\n\nMencer denied that Israel was using starvation as a deliberate strategy, asking why, if that was the case, would Israel have sent \u201cenough food aid to fill Wembley Stadium in London to the brim 80 times over\u201d into Gaza during the conflict.\n\nBut the aid allowed into Gaza through much of the 19-month conflict has been inadequate, unpredictable and subject to much-criticised bureaucratic procedures that blocked many shipments and slowed more. It was also hard to distribute given the widespread destruction and continuing violence.\n\nAlmost 53,000 people have been killed since the Israeli offensive began. Sanitation systems, water supplies and health services are in ruins. Roads are choked with rubble, and bulldozers are systematically targeted by Israel.\n\nIsraeli officials argue that Hamas steals and sells aid to fund its military and other operations. Therefore, they say, the restriction of aid is necessary to defeat the militant Islamist organisation, which killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in its raid on Israel on 7 October 2023, and to secure the return of the 57 of the 251 hostages taken that day who are still held in Gaza.\n\nInstead, Israel has made its own plan to distribute aid from six major hubs in southern Gaza, which would be run by private contractors and defended by Israeli troops.\n\nAid agencies say they have robust mechanisms to prevent leakage of aid, and that Hamas steals little, if any. They also say they believe the new Israeli scheme is impractical, inadequate, likely to be dangerous and is potentially unlawful as it would displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, forcing them into ever smaller parts of the territory. Given this, they said they cannot agree to cooperate with it.",

    "title": "Israeli bombing wave kills dozens in Gaza including at least 22 children, say reports",
    "body": "An intense wave of Israeli bombing on Wednesday killed as many as 80 people in Gaza, including many children, signalling a new escalation of violence in the devastated Palestinian territory at a critical moment in regional politics.\n\nThe exact number of deaths from the attacks was unclear, but even the lower estimates made it one of the highest tolls in a single morning for many weeks.\n\nCivil defence officials in Gaza said 80 had been killed, while medical officials said at least 50 people, including 22 children, were killed in strikes around the Jabaliya neighbourhood in northern Gaza alone, according to hospitals and health officials.\n\nFootage of mourners in the north of the territory showed weeping women kneeling next to bodies wrapped in bloodstained white shrouds.\n\nMohammed Salha, the director of al-Awda hospital in Jabaliya, said his staff had treated 52 injured casualties brought in overnight and during Wednesday morning, including a four-month-old infant with severe leg injuries.\n\n\u201cEven after 19 months, no one gets used to such sights \u2026 We are all exhausted,\u201d Salha said.\n\nThe airstrikes were concentrated in the northern parts of Gaza, from where two rockets were launched at Israel on Tuesday. The Israeli military has issued fresh evacuation orders for the Rimal neighbourhood in Gaza City, alleging that Hamas has been using schools and health facilities there.\n\nThe new attacks comes as the US president, Donald Trump, continues his Middle East visit and follows a brief pause in Israel\u2019s continuing offensive to allow the release by Hamas of the 21-year-old Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, which briefly raised hopes for a new ceasefire.\n\nIsrael has threatened to launch a massive new offensive to \u201cconquer\u201d Gaza if Hamas does not release the 58 hostages it is still holding and make other concessions.\n\n1:12 Israel hits Gaza hospitals in deadly new wave of strikes \u2013 video\n\nThe stop-start negotiations to end the war are continuing in the Qatari capital, Doha, which Trump was visiting on Wednesday.\n\nOfficials said Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minster, had held talks with the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who has been tasked by Trump with ending the war in Gaza, on \u201cthe issue of the hostages and the missing\u201d.\n\nWitkoff later said Trump had \u201ca really productive conversation\u201d with Qatar\u2019s emir about a ceasefire deal in Gaza, adding that \u201cwe are moving along and we have a good plan together\u201d.\n\nIsrael is under increasing pressure to end its total blockade of Gaza, which was imposed in early March. Earlier this week, UN-backed food security experts said the territory\u2019s 2.3 million population was at critical risk of famine.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, called for \u201cunimpeded humanitarian access\u201d to the Palestinian territory, while Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was \u201cever more dramatic and unjustifiable\u201d. Anita Anand, the new Canadian foreign minister, accused Israel of using food as a political tool.\n\nIsraeli officials have rejected the criticism, saying that Hamas routinely steals and sells aid to finance military and other operations, and arguing that the blockade was necessary to force Hamas to release the hostages it is still holding. They say Israel is working with the US on a new plan for distributing aid to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, involving a series of hubs in the south of Gaza that would be run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops.\n\nHumanitarian officials have rejected the plan as unworkable, inadequate, dangerous and potentially unlawful.\n\n0:29 Israeli strike hits Nasser hospital in southern Gaza \u2013 video\n\nSpeaking in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday, Trump said more hostages would follow Alexander, who had been in Hamas captivity since the group launched its surprise attack in October 2023, and added that the people of Gaza deserved a better future.\n\n1:48 Hamas releases Israeli American hostage Edan Alexander from Gaza \u2013 video report\n\nNetanyahu credited Alexander\u2019s release on Monday to a combination of \u201cour military pressure and the political pressure exerted by President Trump\u201d. This has been rejected by Hamas, which has said it engaged in direct talks with Washington on a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nTrump\u2019s tour began in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. His next stop will be the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIsrael\u2019s offensive has obliterated vast swathes of Gaza, destroying health, sanitation and other infrastructure and displacing 90% of the population, often multiple times.\n\n\n\nIsraeli media reported that one target in a strike on a hospital in Khan Younis on Tuesday was Mohammed Sinwar, younger brother of the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli forces last October. The military would not comment beyond saying it had targeted a Hamas \u201ccommand and control centre\u201d which it said was located beneath the European hospital.\n\n\n\nMohammed Sinwar is believed to be Hamas\u2019s top military leader in Gaza. Israel has tried to assassinate him multiple times over the past decades.\n\n\n\nDr Marwan al-Hams, the director general of field hospitals at Gaza\u2019s health ministry, said the strike had severely damaged the hospital\u2019s water and sewage systems, as well as its courtyard. He added that the Israeli military hit a bulldozer brought in by hospital authorities to repair the area to allow ambulances reach the building.\n\nHamas\u2019s 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, and the abduction of 251. The ensuing Israeli offensive has killed at least 52,908 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the territory that is considered reliable by the UN.",

    "title": "Trump meets Syria\u2019s \u2018attractive, tough\u2019 president after lifting US sanctions",
    "body": "Donald Trump has met Syria\u2019s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Saudi Arabia, telling the former jihadist he had an \u201cextraordinary opportunity\u201d, and said Washington is exploring normalising ties with Damascus, a day after an announcement that all US sanctions on Syria would be lifted.\n\nThe US president met Sharaa, a former militant who fought against US forces in Iraq and had a $10m US bounty on his head until December 2024, alongside the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for about half an hour before a conference of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as part of his four-day visit to the Middle East.\n\nIt was the first meeting between a US and a Syrian president for 25 years and a key milestone for Syria\u2019s reintegration into the international arena after the toppling of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One after the meeting that Sharaa was a \u201cyoung, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.\u201d\n\nIn Syria, people watched the images of their president standing beside the leaders of the US and Saudi Arabia on their TV screens in amazement. For many it was a sign that 15 years of international isolation could finally be coming to an end.\n\nStalls that had popped up by Damascus\u2019s Ummayad mosque after the fall of Assad in December now sold the Saudi flag alongside the Syrian \u2013 thanks for Saudi\u2019s role in helping arrange the Trump-Sharaa meeting.\n\n\u201cFor 15 years the world had this picture of us Syrians as refugees. Now they see us as we are. You can finally see light and you can see hope,\u201d said Hossam al-Khouli, 50, the owner of a handicraft shop in Damascus\u2019s old city.\n\nBehind Khouli was a wall filled with handmade mirrors and boxes inlaid with Damascus\u2019s famed mother-of-pearl. It was rare that he sold pieces these days, he said, as Syria had had few tourists over the last 15 years. Trump and Sharaa\u2019s meeting seemed to him a sign that soon he may have plenty of visitors to sell to.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump spoke last night, it was the first time in my life that I listened to any president in the world and began to clap. He\u2019s a great man, really, he is a great man,\u201d Khouli said, smiling.\n\nTrump also seemed pleased with the meeting. He said he thought Sharaa had a \u201creal shot at holding it [Syria] together\u201d and that the Syrian president had agreed to eventually join the Abraham accords, which would normalise Syrian ties with Israel. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco signed the US-brokered accords in 2020.\n\n\u201c[I am] ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria to give them a fresh start,\u201d Trump told the GCC. \u201cIt gives them a chance for greatness. The sanctions were really crippling, very powerful.\u201d\n\nAccording to a White House spokesperson, Trump urged Sharaa to \u201cdeport Palestinian terrorists\u201d, help the US against Islamic State, and to deal with the country\u2019s remaining chemical weapons stock.\n\nThe meeting, which Trump said had come at the urging of Prince Mohammed and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, was remarkable as the Trump administration had previously been wary of engaging with Sharaa, a former leader of the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham who has sought to moderate his image in recent years. Sharaa previously led the Syrian wing of al-Qaida before cutting ties with the group in 2016.\n\nIt was the culmination of months of diplomacy by the new Syrian government, which overthrew Assad\u2019s regime at the end of the last year, as well as their Turkish and Saudi allies, who believed face time with Trump would help end Syria\u2019s international isolation. Damascus had prepared a pitch to Trump that included access to Syrian oil, reassurances of Israel\u2019s security and a proposal to build a Trump tower in Damascus.\n\nTrump later arrived in Qatar for the second leg of his Middle East trip, where he oversaw the signing of a $96bn order from Qatar Airways for up to 160 Boeing aircraft and a statement of intent for more than $38bn in future defence investments.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Trump administration released a sharply worded statement urging Damascus to protect minorities after attacks by pro-Assad forces sparked revenge killings of nearly 900 mostly Alawite civilians in north-west Syria in March.\n\nThe US state department had handed the Syrians a 12-point list of conditions to end sanctions, which included protection of minorities and the US maintaining the right to conduct strikes against what it considered \u201cterrorists\u201d on Syrian soil. They were in the process of negotiating when Trump suddenly announced the lifting of US sanctions on Tuesday night at an investment conference in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt came despite Israeli suspicions of the Islamist government in Damascus. Israel has said it will not allow government forces to deploy in southern Syria, and it has carried out dozens of airstrikes across the country in recent months.\n\nThe end of US sanctions will be a step towards reintegrating Syria into the international economic system and a boost to the battered economy trying to rebuild after 14 years of civil war.\n\n1:11 Syrians welcome Trump's decision to lift sanctions \u2013 video\n\nThe announcement of the end of sanctions was met with jubilation in Damascus. Beeping cars waving Syrian flags filled the country\u2019s capital. A traditional Syrian band played in the city\u2019s old quarter, the beats of the drums accompanied by whooping cheers. Social media in Syria was meanwhile filled with videos of Trump dancing, his signature double-fist pump set to Syrian anthems.\n\n\u201cEveryone is happy and in the streets. Thank God, a thousand times thank God,\u201d said Omar al-Nafa, who works in education.\n\nSyria\u2019s economy is battered from 14 years of war, with the UN estimating more than 90% of the population lives in poverty. Much of the country\u2019s housing stock is destroyed and basic services, such as electricity and internet, remain dysfunctional.\n\nSyria\u2019s new government set ambitious goals to rebuild the country but was hampered by severe economic sanctions. Under US sanctions, Syria had no access to the international Swift banking system, and international businesses were reluctant to trade with the country for fear of falling foul of the US treasury.\n\nNafa said: \u201cIt will take some time for it to be actually implemented, but hopefully it will help the economy.\u201d",

    "body": "People on weight loss drugs regain all the weight they have lost within a year of stopping the medication, analysis has shown.\n\nAnalysis of 11 studies of older and newer GLP-1 weight loss drugs by the University of Oxford found that patients typically lost 8kg on weight loss jabs but returned to their original weight within 10 months of stopping them.\n\nThe study, presented at the European Congress on Obesity, found that even for those taking newer, higher-dose weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, people put weight back on once they stopped treatment. While those taking semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) lost double the amount of weight compared with people using older jabs \u2013 16kg on average \u2013 patients put on 9.6kg within a year, meaning they could expect to regain all 16kg again in just over 20 months.\n\nThe researchers studied 6,370 adults in eight randomised controlled trials and three observational studies. Of these, 1,465 patients were taking semaglutide and tirzepatide \u2013 higher-dose jabs recommended specifically for weight loss.\n\nPrevious analysis of trials into the efficacy of different diets, not including drugs, by the same researchers, found that while people also regained weight after stopping diets, the rate of regain was much slower, taking at least five years to get back to the weight they were before.\n\n\u201cThese drugs are very effective at helping you lose weight, but when you stop them, weight regain is much faster than [after stopping] diets,\u201d said Susan Jebb, the co-author of the study and professor of diet and population health at University of Oxford.\n\nThe findings raise issues for the NHS, as Nice guidelines state people should not be on weight loss injections for more than two years. Additionally, many patients give up the treatment, whether because they are buying it privately so cannot afford it, because the side-effects do not suit them or because they are not losing weight any more.\n\n\u201cIs it going to be worth the NHS investing in these drugs if they only have them for a short time and then they pile all the weight back on, or does the NHS have to accept that these are going to be long-term therapies?\u201d Jebb added.\n\n\u201cEither people really have to accept this as a treatment for life,, or we in science need to think really, really hard, how to support people when they stop the drug\u200b.\u201d\n\nWhile the study did not show causality, Jebb speculated that the difference in how fast people put weight back on could be due to the fact that diets are hard and people have to practise restraint to lose weight, whereas if you are taking a drug that knocks your hunger out completely, you don\u2019t have to\u200b make that effort. \u201cSo when the drugs are then taken away, you haven\u2019t got those sort of behavioural strategies in place that help keep the weight off.\u201d\n\nResponding to the findings, Tam Fry, the chair of the National Obesity Forum, said: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone if people regain weight having used GLP-1 drugs without seriously attempting to improve their lifestyle \u2026 Using GLP-1 is not the quick fix which many users believe it to be.\u201d\n\nJane Ogden, a professor of health psychology at Surrey University, said there was no point \u201cjust throwing people back out into the world of their own lives, carrying on their own behaviours from before\u201d after coming off the injections.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to need psychological counselling, behaviour change, nutritional support from that moment on to help them sustain healthier behaviour in the long term, to keep the weight off,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe NHS should introduce a stepped care approach through online support available to large numbers of people at low cost, online or in-person group support or more intensive 1:1 support.\u201d\n\nJason Halford, at the European Association for the Study of Obesity, said: \u201cWe need to ensure patients have the support to make the changes in their behaviour they need to sustain the benefits of treatment.

    "body": "About 1.5 million foreign workers who have moved to Britain since 2020 may have to wait a further five years to apply for permanent settlement.\n\nUnder changes set out in the immigration white paper, automatic settlement and citizenship rights will be granted after 10 years instead of five. But the paper did not specify whether this would apply to recent arrivals already in the UK and in the process of their application.\n\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, will consult stakeholders on whether the changes will apply to all migrants who have arrived in the UK in the past five years, according to government sources.\n\nIf the change goes through, it would mean that 1.5 million foreign workers who would have qualified for permanent settlement as soon as this year face having to wait until they have lived in Britain for 10 years.\n\nThe Labour MP Florence Eshalomi told the House of Commons on Tuesday that she had been contacted by several of her constituents in Vauxhall and Camberwell Green, in south London, who were \u201cworried about where this uncertainty leaves them\u201d.\n\nShe said: One even told me that they were so worried that they were considering leaving the UK, because their settled status here is in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nIf ministers do decide to apply the changes to arrivals from 2020, this would make government policy in the area more robust even than that sought by the Conservatives, who have suggested dating it to 2021.\n\nA number of Labour MPs and others have expressed concern at some of the measures in the white paper and the language used by Keir Starmer to introduce it, including that recent levels of migration have caused \u201cincalculable\u201d damage to the country and that the UK risks becoming \u201can island of strangers\u201d.\n\nAt prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Starmer won unwelcome praise from Nigel Farage for his rhetoric on the subject. The Reform UK leader said he had \u201cvery much enjoyed\u201d Starmer\u2019s speech on Monday, adding: \u201cYou seem to be learning a very great deal from us.\u201d\n\nLiz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster group leader, accused Starmer of demonising migrants with his language. Starmer said that was \u201crubbish\u201d and said: \u201cI want to lead a country where we pull together and walk into the future as neighbours and as communities, not as strangers, and the loss of control of migration by the last government put all of that at risk, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re fixing the system based on principles of control, selection and fairness.\u201d\n\nShabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, defended the prime minister while resisting an invitation to repeat his exact words, and called for the UK to become \u201ca nation of neighbours\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cI agree with the prime minister that without curbs on migration, without making sure that we have strong rules that everyone follows, and that we have a pace of immigration that allows for integration into our country, we do risk becoming a nation of people estranged from one another.\n\n\u201cWhat he has described is something that I absolutely believe in, which are the values of the Labour party, which is a desire to see this country as a nation of neighbours.\u201d\n\nSeparately, vice-chancellors and other higher education sector leaders have warned that proposals in the white paper on international students will worsen the financial crisis already affecting universities.\n\nWith four in 10 universities in England likely to be in deficit this summer, Jo Johnson, the former Conservative universities minister, said few were in a position to absorb the government\u2019s proposed 6% levy on income from overseas students or pass it on in higher fees. \u201cThis risks both weakening the financial position of the sector and making it harder to compete in a global market for talent,\u201d he said.\n\nShitij Kapur, the vice-chancellor and president of King\u2019s College London, where 54% of students are from overseas, said: \u201cThe precise details of the wording and policy change matters less than how it is perceived in the 150 countries we recruit our students from. Are we still seen as a welcoming jurisdiction?\u201d\n\nSteve West, the vice-chancellor of UWE Bristol, speaking on behalf of University Alliance, said the international student levy was an additional tax on universities. \u201cTaken alongside eye-watering pension costs and the national insurance hikes, [it] would add to a mounting proportion of university resources being diverted to the Treasury,\u201d he said.\n\nCombined with a proposed cut to the graduate post-study work visa from two years to 18 months, also outlined in the white paper, West warned of a further drop in international students. Numbers are already in decline after a clampdown by the previous government, a factor that is exacerbating the financial crisis in the sector.",

It is for government to set the laws and incentivise companies to obey it not run roundtables trying to work out technical solutions that they are not fit to provide.\n\n\u201cIt is astonishing that a Labour government would abandon the labour force of an entire sector. My inbox is filled with individual artists and global companies who are bewildered that the government would allow theft at scale and cosy up to those who are thieving. There is another way, but this government have chosen to ignore it.\n\n\u201cAcross the creative and business community, across parliament, people are gobsmacked that the government is playing parliamentary chess with their livelihoods.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This could include removing the reference to regulation, or omitting a timeframe for it to be implemented.\n\nOwen Meredith, the chief executive of the News Media Association, said: \u201cIt is extremely disappointing that the government has failed to listen to the deep concerns of the creative industries, including news publishers who are so fundamental to uploading our democratic values, by rejecting the House of Lords amendments that would have given a workable and proportionate level of transparency to creators over the use of their works by AI.\n\n\u201cInstead, the government has used parliamentary procedure to dismiss industry concerns, rather than taking this timely opportunity to introduce the transparency that will drive a dynamic licensing market for the UK\u2019s immensely valuable creative content. There is still time for parliament to back our great British creative industries, while supporting AI firm\u2019s access to high-quality data, as the bill heads back to the Lords. The government must recognise the urgent need to take the necessary powers now.\u201d\n\nLast week, hundreds of artists and organisations including Paul McCartney, Jeanette Winterson, Dua Lipa and the Royal Shakespeare Company urged the prime minister not to \u201cgive our work away at the behest of a handful of powerful overseas tech companies\u201d.\n\nThe government\u2019s copyright proposals are the subject of a consultation due to report back this year, but opponents of the plans have used the data bill as a vehicle for registering their disapproval.\n\nThe main government proposal is to let AI firms use copyright-protected work to build their models without permission unless the copyright holders opt out \u2013 a solution that critics say is unworkable.\n\nThe government insists that the creative and tech sectors are being held back and this needs to be resolved through new legislation. It has already tabled one concession in the data bill by committing to an economic impact assessment of its proposals.\n\nA Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson said: \u201cWe want our creative industries and AI companies to flourish, which is why we have been separately consulting on a package of measures that we hope will work for both sectors. We have always been clear that we will not rush into any decisions or bring forward any legislation until we are confident that we have a practical plan which delivers on each of our objectives.\u201d",

    "title": "Jail time for recalled offenders to be limited to free up prison places",
    "body": "Shabana Mahmood will limit for how long hundreds of repeat offenders can be recalled to prison amid Whitehall predictions that jails will be full again in November.\n\nThe justice secretary also announced a \u00a34.7bn plan to build three new prisons starting this year, part of a \u201crecord expansion\u201d as the government attempts to get to grips with the criminal justice system.\n\nSenior Tories accused Mahmood of failing to punish criminals, sarcastically saying repeat offenders would be \u201cquaking in their boots\u201d.\n\nIn an alarming message delivered at a Downing Street press conference, Mahmood said prisons were 99% full, adding: \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything now, we risk a total breakdown in law and order.\u201d\n\nThere would be a shake-up of the \u201cprison recall\u201d system to allow some prisoners to be returned to prison for only a fixed 28-day period if they breach their licence conditions, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful that this country in 2025 finds itself in this cycle of crisis. It is shameful that for so long, the last Conservative government failed to reckon with the reality of a rising prison population,\u201d Mahmood said.\n\nShe said the new recall measures were expected to free up about 1,400 places. They will apply to offenders who were sentenced to between one and four years and were let out on licence but committed another offence.\n\nAsked how many people would be released as a result of the fixed-term measures, Mahmood said: \u201cWe believe that that number will allow us to get from November into spring of next year \u2026 we are on track to hit zero capacity within our prison estate by November, and this measure will tide us over until any changes from the sentencing review start to hit the system.\u201d\n\nThe proposals have been condemned by two government-appointed tsars who represent victims, who claim that sexual and domestic abusers will be freed to terrorise victims again.\n\nDame Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, said: \u201cI cannot stress enough the lack of consideration for victims\u2019 safety and how many lives are being put in danger because of this proposed change.\n\n\u201cYou are not sent to prison for four years if you do not pose significant risk to your victim or the wider public. Perpetrators of domestic abuse know everything about their victim \u2026 Re-releasing them back into the community after 28 days is simply unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this worse is that ministers cannot safely exempt all perpetrators of domestic abuse from this proposal, because they do not know how many domestic abusers are serving time in prison or currently being monitored by probation.\u201d\n\nThe victims\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales, Baroness Newlove, said she would be writing to Mahmood to express her concern that the \u201cshort-term, stopgap\u201d measures are corroding confidence in justice.\n\n\u201cI find it difficult to understand why this specific group of offenders has been targeted for early release and I am concerned about the implications for victim safety,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI will be seeking urgent clarity from the lord chancellor on how this policy will operate in practice \u2013 and what safeguards will be put in place.\u201d\n\nA standard recall currently results in offenders being taken back to prison for the remainder of their sentence, but it can be for shorter fixed terms in some circumstances.\n\nThe latest measures are aimed at dealing with the scale of the continuing crisis in jails, with the latest weekly prison population in England and Wales standing at 88,087. This is 434 below the last peak in the prison population of 88,521 inmates on 6 September, recorded just before the government began freeing thousands of prisoners early as part of efforts to curb overcrowding.\n\nThe three prisons will be built near existing prisons, Mahmood said, with construction workers breaking ground on a site near HMP Gartree in Leicestershire later this year.\n\nOfficials said the others would be near HMP Garth near Leyland, Lancashire, and HMP Grendon in the village of Grendon Underwood, Buckinghamshire.\n\nMahmood said that despite \u201crecord prison expansion\u201d, England and Wales would still be more than 9,000 prison places short by 2028. The recall population in prisons had more than doubled in seven years, she said.\n\nSome offenders will be excluded from the scheme, \u201cincluding any offender who has been recalled for committing a serious further offence\u201d, Mahmood said.\n\nAmy Rees, the Ministry of Justice interim permanent secretary, said the government would run out of prison places in five months\u2019 time if further measures were not taken.\n\n\u201cOn our current trajectory, the prison population rises by 3,000, and now we expect to hit zero capacity \u2013 to entirely run out of prison places for adult men \u2013 in November of this year,\u201d she said.\n\n11:57 Can the UK fix its broken prison system? \u2013 video\n\nNext week an independent sentencing review will recommend a package of measures on prison overcrowding. Led by the former Tory justice secretary David Gauke, it will say prisoners will be able to earn their freedom after serving a third of their sentences under new minimum and maximum sentence plans.\n\nOffenders in England and Wales will be able to earn early release if they complete work, training or education assignments and demonstrate good behaviour.\n\nGauke is expected to support the further rollout of specialist courts to break addictions of prolific offenders. Intensive supervision courts have been set up for female offenders in three pilots across England and Wales.\n\nMahmood said changes from a sentencing bill would be expected to start having an effect in April next year. \u201cWe will legislate at pace. And as I described earlier, currently we\u2019re on track to come down to zero capacity in November of this year,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve announced the measures on fixed-term recall today. We would anticipate that any changes from a sentencing bill could start having an impact on April of next year, so that\u2019s the timeline that we are working to. We\u2019re moving very, very quickly, but it\u2019s because we want to make sure we never have to do emergency releases again.\u201d\n\nPosting on X, the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: \u201cLabour are so obsessed with working from home, they want to roll it out to prisoners too. Criminals will be quaking in their boots.\u201d",
    "summary": "It is shameful that for so long, the last Conservative government failed to reckon with the reality of a rising prison population,\u201d Mahmood said.\nShe said the new recall measures were expected to free up about 1,400 places.\nThe three prisons will be built near existing prisons, Mahmood said, with construction workers breaking ground on a site near HMP Gartree in Leicestershire later this year.\nMahmood said that despite \u201crecord prison expansion\u201d, England and Wales would still be more than 9,000 prison places short by 2028.\n\u201cOn our current trajectory, the prison population rises by 3,000, and now we expect to hit zero capacity \u2013 to entirely run out of prison places for adult men \u2013 in November of this year,\u201d she said.",

    "title": "Menendez brothers \u2018huge step\u2019 closer to freedom as judge reduces sentences",
    "body": "After months of delays and decades behind bars, Erik and Lyle Menendez now have a long-awaited chance at freedom after a judge reduced their sentences for the 1989 killings of their parents.\n\nTheir family and extensive network of supporters celebrated on Tuesday when Judge Michael Jesic resentenced the brothers from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life. The judge\u2019s decision means they are immediately eligible for parole under California\u2019s youthful offender law because of their young ages at the time of the murders.\n\nSoon they will appear before the parole board, which will decide whether or not they should be released. Their freedom is not guaranteed, but this week\u2019s developments bring them closer than they have ever been to leaving prison.\n\n\u201cThey are a real family,\u201d Mark Geragos, the brothers\u2019 lead attorney, said after the hearing. \u201cReal people who have lived through unimaginable horrors. And I\u2019m hopeful and glad that we\u2019re one huge step closer to bringing the boys home.\u201d\n\nTheir release could at last bring a close to a case that has dominated headlines and captured public attention for nearly four decades. In 1989, Lyle, a 21-year-old student at Princeton, and Erik, an 18-year-old tennis star, attacked their parents with shotguns as they watched television and ate ice-cream in their Beverly Hills home. Jose, a prominent entertainment executive, was shot five times, while Kitty was shot nine times.\n\nThe brothers initially said the killings were related to the mafia or their father\u2019s business, but eventually they confessed, and said that they had killed their parents in self-defense. They said they feared their parents were going to kill them to prevent them from speaking out about the long-term sexual abuse they experienced from their father. Prosecutors argued the brothers killed their parents in order to receive their multimillion-dollar inheritance.\n\nThey were convicted of the murders in 1996 after two heavily covered trials \u2013 their first trial was one of the first to be almost entirely televised on Court TV. But in recent years the prevailing narrative around the brothers and their crimes began to shift \u2013 in part due to viral TikToks that focused on their allegations of abuse.\n\nAttention intensified in the last year and a half. First, a letter written by Erik to his late cousin before the killings that corroborated his allegations of abuse surfaced after it was found among family belongings in 2018. Then, a former member of the band Menudo said he, too, was abused by Jose Menendez as a young teen in the 1980s. Erik and Lyle filed filed a habeas corpus petition in 2023, which challenged their convictions as unconstitutional.\n\nBut 2024 brought significantly more focus on the case \u2013 and movement. It was the subject of a documentary and Netflix series. Erik and Lyle received an outpouring of support from criminal justice reform advocates, including Kim Kardashian. And George Gasc\u00f3n, the progressive former Los Angeles county district attorney, said he believed the brothers\u2019 accounts of abuse and that they had been rehabilitated.\n\nHe recommended they be resentenced, opening the door to their release.\n\nThe current district attorney, Nathan Hochman, who beat Gasc\u00f3n in the November election, quickly reversed course and sought twice to withdraw the resentencing petition. He argued the brothers had not taken full responsibility for their crimes and his office has said it does not believe they were abused.\n\nBut the proceedings eventually moved ahead and after several delays due to the LA wildfires and disputes between the defense and prosecution, Erik and Lyle, now 54 and 57 respectively, were back in court on Tuesday where several family members and supporters spoke on their behalf.\n\nThe brothers have the support of their entire family \u2013 with the exception of a recently deceased uncle \u2013 who have said they forgive the brothers and want them to be freed. Relatives spoke about the abuse the brothers say they faced, their accomplishments in prison and the desire to see them released.\n\n\u201cWe all, on both sides of the family, believe that 35 years is enough,\u201d she told the court. \u201cThey are universally forgiven by the family.\u201d\n\nJonathan Colby, a retired judge, told the court that he considered himself tough on crime but he had got to know the brothers and was impressed with the programs they started in prison to provide aid and care for older and disabled prisoners.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not many prisoners I meet like Erik and Lyle that have such concern for the elderly,\u201d he said.\n\nAnerae Brown, who was once incarcerated with the brothers, cried as he testified about how they helped him heal and get on the path to rehabilitation, leading to his release from prison, and called the programs they started \u201cMenendez University\u201d.\n\nErik and Lyle attended the proceedings virtually and read statements to the court, acknowledging the impact of the crimes. \u201cYou did not deserve what I did to you, but you inspire me to do better,\u201d Erik Menendez said, addressing his family.\n\nJesic issued his decision immediately after the brothers spoke, and granted them a new sentence of 50 years to life. Because they were under 26 at the time of the murders, they are immediately eligible for parole.\n\nHochman, the LA district attorney, said his office\u2019s opposition to their resentencing \u201censured that the court was presented with all the facts before making such a consequential decision\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe decision to resentence Erik and Lyle Menendez was a monumental one that has significant implications for the families involved, the community, and the principles of justice,\u201d the district attorney added.\n\n\u201cOur office\u2019s motions to withdraw the resentencing motion filed by the previous administration ensured that the court was presented with all the facts before making such a consequential decision.\u201d\n\nThe brothers are expected to appear before the parole board on 13 June for a clemency petition they submitted to the governor \u2013 though it is not yet clear if that will serve as their parole hearing or if additional proceedings will be scheduled. If parole is granted, and California\u2019s governor allows the decision to stand, they will be released.\n\nLegal analysts anticipated they will be granted parole.\n\n\u201cThe brothers are very likely to be released within a matter of months. The parole board is going to be overwhelmed with voices in support of the brothers,\u201d said Neama Rahmani, a former assistant US attorney and the president of West Coast Trial Lawyers.\n\n\u201cEvery living family member of Jose and Kitty Menendez supported their release, which is almost unheard of in a murder case like this one.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed",

    "body": "Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Boeing had secured a record-breaking $96bn deal to sell Qatar up to 210 Boeing jets, an agreement that comes as the president portrays the Gulf state\u2019s controversial offer to gift him a $400m luxury aircraft as an opportunity too valuable to refuse.\n\nThe Qatar Airways purchase of the Boeing jets \u2013 described as the largest order in the company\u2019s history \u2013 formed the centerpiece of economic agreements valued at more than $243bn signed during Trump\u2019s visit to Doha. The White House claims the aviation agreement alone will support 154,000 American jobs annually, though it was unclear how those figures were calculated.\n\nTrump also secured a statement of intent for more than $38bn in future defense investments from Qatar, further intertwining America\u2019s economic and security relationships with the Gulf state now offering him a luxury aircraft.\n\nAhead of the deal, Trump dismissed mounting ethical concerns about accepting Qatar\u2019s separate offer of a \u201cpalace in the sky\u201d Boeing 747-8 jetliner \u2013 complaining that the current presidential aircraft simply doesn\u2019t match up to those of Gulf monarchies.\n\n\u201cThe plane that you\u2019re on is almost 40 years old,\u201d Trump told the Fox News host Sean Hannity during an Air Force One interview on the Middle East trip, where he is also visiting Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\u201cWhen you land and you see Saudi Arabia, you see UAE and you see Qatar, and they have these brand-new Boeing 747s, mostly. You see ours next to it \u2013 this is like a totally different plane.\u201d\n\nClearly irritated by questions about the ethical criticism of accepting such a lavish gift as president, Trump insisted American prestige was at stake. \u201cWe\u2019re the United States of America. I believe we should have the most impressive plane.\u201d\n\nThe timing of Trump\u2019s visit has raised eyebrows, coming just weeks after the Trump Organization secured a deal with Qatar for a luxury resort and golf course development outside the capital, Doha, called Trump International Golf Club & Villas.\n\n\u201cMy attitude is why wouldn\u2019t I accept a gift?\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWe\u2019re giving to everybody else, why wouldn\u2019t I accept a gift? Because it\u2019s going to be a couple years until the Boeings are finished.\u201d\n\nTrump was referring to the incoming Air Force One fleet, a $3.9bn contract given to Boeing in 2018 with an original timetable of 2024 that has since been delayed by a number of years.\n\nThe US attorney general, Pam Bondi, who worked as a lobbyist for Qatar while at her previous employer Ballard Partners, has declared accepting the aircraft \u201clegally permissible\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s much-touted trade deals, coming as Qatar dangles what Democratic representative Ritchie Torres described as a \u201cflying grift\u201d, has triggered alarm across the political spectrum. Torres has argued that the winged present violates the constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which explicitly prohibits federal officials from accepting valuable gifts from foreign powers without congressional approval.\n\nEven staunch Trump allies have broken ranks, including the Texas senator Ted Cruz, who warned that the aircraft deal \u201cposes significant espionage and surveillance problems\u201d, while the West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito said bluntly she would \u201cbe checking for bugs\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The process would require dismantling the aircraft to search for surveillance devices before installing sophisticated security and communications systems.\n\nThe actual Air Force One, while older, acts as a mobile version of the White House, and has anti-missile defense systems, hardened and encrypted communications, secure compartments for senior leadership, and the ability to refuel midair.\n\nTrump\u2019s Gulf tour began with a speech at the Saudi US Investment Forum 2025, where he praised the region\u2019s leaders.

    "title": "US overdose deaths fell 27% in 2024 in largest one-year decline ever",
    "body": "There were 30,000 fewer US drug overdose deaths in 2024 than the year before \u2013 the largest one-year decline ever recorded.\n\nAn estimated 80,000 people died from overdoses last year, according to provisional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released on Wednesday. That is down 27% from 110,000 in 2023.\n\nThe CDC has been collecting comparable data for 45 years. The previous largest one-year drop was 4% in 2018, according to the agency\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nAll but two states experienced declines last year, with Nevada and South Dakota experiencing small increases. Some of the biggest drops were in Ohio, West Virginia and other states that have been hard-hit in the nation\u2019s decades-long overdose epidemic.\n\nExperts say more research needs to be done to understand what drove the reduction, but they mention several possible factors. Among the most cited:\n\nIncreased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone.\n\nExpanded addiction treatment.\n\nShifts in how people use drugs.\n\nThe growing impact of billions of dollars in opioid lawsuit settlement money.\n\nThe number of at-risk Americans is shrinking, after waves of deaths in older adults and a shift in teens and younger adults away from the drugs that cause most deaths.\n\nStill, US annual overdose deaths are higher than they were before the Covid-19 pandemic. In a statement, the CDC noted that overdoses are still the leading cause of death for people 18-44 years old, \u201cunderscoring the need for ongoing efforts to maintain this progress\u201d.\n\nSome experts worry that the recent decline could be slowed or stopped by reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce, or a shift away from the strategies that seem to be working.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal,\u201d said Dr Daniel Ciccarone, a drug policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nThe provisional numbers are estimates of everyone who died of overdoses in the US, including non-citizens. That data is still being processed, and the final numbers can sometimes differ a bit. But it is clear that there was a huge drop last year.\n\nExperts note that there have been past moments when US overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again. That happened in 2018.\n\nBut there are reasons to be optimistic.\n\nNaloxone has become more widely available, in part because of the introduction of over-the-counter versions that do not require prescriptions.\n\nMeanwhile, drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and other businesses have settled lawsuits with state and local governments over the painkillers that were a main driver of overdose deaths in the past. The deals over the last decade or so have promised about $50bn over time, with most of it required to be used to fight addiction.\n\nAnother settlement that would be among the largest, with members of the Sackler family who own OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma agreeing to pay up to $7bn, could be approved this year.\n\nThe money, along with federal taxpayer funding, is going to a variety of programs, including supportive housing and harm reduction efforts, such as providing materials to test drugs for fentanyl, the biggest driver of overdoses now.\n\nBut what each state will do with that money is currently at issue. \u201cStates can either say, \u2018We won, we can walk away\u2019\u201d in the wake of the declines or they can use the lawsuit money on naloxone and other efforts, said Regina LaBelle, a former acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. She now heads an addiction and public policy program at Georgetown University.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s administration views opioids as largely a law enforcement issue and as a reason to step up border security. That worries many public health leaders and advocates.\n\n\u201cWe believe that taking a public health approach that seeks to support \u2013 not punish \u2013 people who use drugs is crucial to ending the overdose crisis,\u201d said Dr Tamara Olt, an Illinois woman whose 16-year-old son died of a heroin overdose in 2012. She is now executive director of Broken No Moore, an advocacy organization focused on substance use disorder.\n\nOlt attributes recent declines to the growing availability of naloxone, work to make treatment available, and wider awareness of the problem.\n\nKimberly Douglas, an Illinois woman whose 17-year-old son died of an overdose in 2023, credited the growing chorus of grieving mothers. \u201cEventually people are going to start listening. Unfortunately, it\u2019s taken 10-plus years.\u201d",

    "body": "The former special counsel prosecutor Jay Bratt asserted his fifth amendment right not to answer questions during a Wednesday deposition before a Republican-led House committee looking for evidence of politicization in the prosecutions of Donald Trump, a spokesman said.\n\nBratt, who led the federal criminal case over the US president\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents as a top deputy to the former special counsel Jack Smith, was invited to testify by the House judiciary committee, which is chaired by the Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, a prominent defender of the president.\n\n\u201cThis administration and its proxies have made no effort to hide their willingness to weaponize the machinery of government against those they perceive as political enemies. That should alarm every American who believes in the rule of law,\u201d said Peter Carr, a spokesman for Justice Connection, a network of former justice department staff working to protect our former colleagues and the rule of law.\n\n\u201cIn light of these undeniable and deeply troubling circumstances, Mr Bratt had no choice but to invoke his fifth amendment rights.\u201d\n\nThe appearance by Bratt, who declined to comment, was the first known instance of a special counsel prosecutor being hauled before the judiciary committee since Trump took office vowing revenge and personally directing the firings of more than a dozen prosecutors who worked for Smith within days of his inauguration.\n\nRepublicans on the judiciary committee have long believed that the special counsel cases stemmed from political animus against Trump at the justice department. Jordan declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the committee.\n\nSmith charged Trump in two cases: in Florida, for mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club and defying a subpoena commanding their return; and in Washington, for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Justice department policy does not allow the prosecution of sitting presidents, and Smith dropped both indictments after Trump won re-election last November.\n\nThe federal judge Aileen Cannon had in July of last year dismissed the classified documents case, after ruling that Smith had been unlawfully appointed because he was acting at the justice department with the powers of a \u201cprincipal officer\u201d, which requires confirmation by the Senate. Smith filed an appeal of the decision, which was unresolved at the time of Trump\u2019s election victory in November.\n\nTop justice department officials have made clear that they plan to investigate prosecutors who brought charges against Trump during his four years out of office. Two years ago, after Trump was indicted in Georgia on charges related to tampering with its 2020 election result, the now-attorney general, Pam Bondi, said that justice department prosecutors \u201cwill be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated.\u201d\n\nTrump recently appointed Ed Martin, who temporarily served as the top federal prosecutor in Washington DC, to lead the department\u2019s weaponization working group, which has been tasked with investigating Smith as well as the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, and the Atlanta-area prosecutor Fani Willis, both of whom indicted Trump on state charges.\n\n\u201cThere are some really bad actors, some people that did some really bad things to the American people. And if they can be charged, we\u2019ll charge them. But if they can\u2019t be charged, we will name them \u2026 And in a culture that respects shame, they should be people \u2026 that are shamed,\u201d Martin said at a Tuesday press conference.",

    "title": "Trump\u2019s cryptocurrency endeavor caps a political career filled with conflicts of interest",
    "body": "The 220 winners of a cryptocurrency contest were told on Monday to look out for an email featuring \u201cthe most exclusive invitation in the world\u201d. As a reward for spending immense amounts of money, in some cases millions of dollars, they had won the prize of attending a private gala with Donald Trump at his own Washington DC golf club later this month.\n\nAwarding access to the president in exchange for investment in his crypto endeavor was Trump\u2019s latest conflict of interest in a political career filled with, in the words of one of his most repeated catchphrases, \u201cmany such cases\u201d. Real estate holdings, a media company, merchandising deals, fraud and most recently Qatar\u2019s gift of a $400m plane are only some of the myriad of entanglements that government ethics watchdogs have warned about for a decade now.\n\nTrump\u2019s foray into cryptocurrency is a unique combination and escalation of these conflicts. It involves him leveraging his presidency for personal gain, potentially opening himself up to foreign influence and operating in an industry he has immense power to deregulate. It marries Trump\u2019s unscrupulous business tendencies with an industry that is notorious for fraud, scams and a lack of transparency. It may also become the most lucrative business he\u2019s ever been involved in.\n\nAuctioning off influence\n\nTrump\u2019s shift from cryptocurrency skeptic to industry operator last year was already a concern for ethics and transparency advocates, who worried that, if elected, he could potentially push through crypto-friendly legislation that would benefit his personal financial interests. The auctioning off of direct access to the president through a crypto scheme intensified fears around political corruption and attempts to buy influence, especially given the opaque nature of the contest. The names of the winners are still unknown.\n\nThe rules of the Trump dinner contest stated that the top 220 buyers of $TRUMP, which were listed on a public leaderboard on the coin\u2019s website, would receive an invitation to dine with the president. The top 20 on the leaderboard would gain even more personal access through a VIP reception featuring Trump. The leaderboard only disclosed contestants\u2019 usernames and crypto wallet codes, no other identifying information. Winners could also write down any name they chose on the invite, according to the website\u2019s frequently asked questions page, adding another layer of uncertainty to who will actually attend.\n\nOne of the primary worries from Democrats and ethics groups surrounding the contest is that it may allow foreign actors to purchase influence with Trump through investment in his cryptocurrency. Multiple analyses of the $TRUMP leaderboard have already found that a large percentage of the top buyers used foreign crypto exchanges that prohibit US users from trading on their platforms, suggesting that the winners may be foreign residents.\n\nThe wallet of the top $TRUMP buyer on the leaderboard, who owns more than $18m worth of the coin, has been linked to Hong Kong-based crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun. In 2023, the Securities and Exchange commission (SEC) charged Sun with fraud and other securities violations related to cryptocurrency trading. Since Trump took office, however, the SEC has paused that investigation. Sun also invested tens of millions of dollars into the Trump family\u2019s other crypto ventures last year, and is an adviser to the World Liberty Financial company that Trump\u2019s sons control.\n\nThe $TRUMP coin has also attracted foreign-tied investors beyond the contest. On Monday, a small technology company called GD Culture group that has a Chinese subsidiary company and has a TikTok e-commerce business announced that it had secured $300m in funding to buy up $TRUMP coins. Its purchase would coincide with Trump deciding how to handle TikTok\u2019s potential ban or forced sale within the US.\n\nThe Trump family business isn\u2019t real estate any more\n\nThe Trump family\u2019s entrance into cryptocurrency is a relatively recent development, but since the start of last year, the Trumps have thrown themselves into the industry. Trump heavily courted crypto investors during the presidential election campaign, becoming the first candidate to accept crypto donations and promising to turn the US into the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d at a Bitcoin conference in July. Later that year, Trump announced the creation of the World Liberty Financial crypto venture \u2013 a company that has raised around $550m and which the Trump family controls.\n\nTrump\u2019s reach into the crypto world deepened following his election victory, as he became involved in the creation of so-called memecoins that tend to fluctuate wildly through speculative trading. The $TRUMP cryptocurrency, along with a $MELANIA coin, launched in mid-January days before his inauguration. The value of $TRUMP initially surged to around $75 a coin before crashing down, only to begin slowly increasing in value after Trump announced that the top buyers of the coin would win an exclusive dinner with him.\n\nSince then, crypto firms associated with Trump have expanded to create another cryptocurrency called USD1, a vague \u201cTrump reward points\u201d program and an Exchange-Traded Fund or ETF. This week, Eric Trump also announced that a Bitcoin mining firm the family controls would go public.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal involvement in each of these projects is convoluted, and the companies that control the various aspects of the family\u2019s crypto empire are set up somewhat like nesting dolls. He does not directly own the company that made the $TRUMP memecoin, for instance. Instead, the Trump Organization owns a firm called CIC Digital LLC, which, along with another company called Fight Fight Fight LLC, oversees and profits from the trade of the coin. Those two LLCs also hold around 80% of the coin\u2019s reserves, a share that on paper is worth more than $2bn at current market value.\n\nThe Trump family\u2019s burgeoning crypto empire is a remarkable turnaround from when Trump called Bitcoin a \u201cscam\u201d in 2021 and said it should be highly regulated. There have been huge developments in the cryptocurrency world since then, but the most pertinent in this case may be that Trump now stands to profit from it.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In April, the Department of Justice closed its cryptocurrency fraud investigations unit to align with a pro-crypto executive order from Trump.\n\nThese moves towards deregulation are happening while the crypto industry is still rife with scams, and only a few years after Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fraudulent management of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange resulted in one of the largest financial scandals in modern history. The potential loosening of rules and backing of the crypto industry has effects that go beyond corruption concerns and financial impacts as well. Bitcoin mining facilities that have expanded across the US are also causing energy supply issues, environmental concerns and noise pollution issues, all of which are regulated by agencies that Trump can influence.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and even some Republicans have pushed back against Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest, with some Trump allies suggesting that the dinner was a step too far. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal formalized those concerns last week by announcing an ethics inquiry into the president\u2019s crypto operations.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s financial entanglements to the $TRUMP coin, as well as the attempted use of the White House to host competitions to prop up the value of $TRUMP, represents an unprecedented, pay-to-play scheme to provide access to the Presidency to the highest bidder,\u201d Blumenthal wrote in a letter last week.\n\nTrump\u2019s crypto ventures have also derailed a landmark bill to regulate some forms of cryptocurrency, called the Genius act, that formerly had bipartisan support. Senate Democrats, along with three Republicans, voted down a procedural motion that would have allowed the bill to proceed in its current form \u2013 arguing that it needed stronger protections to prevent the sort of conflicts Trump was creating.\n\n\u201cIt has been shocking to see Donald Trump move at breakneck speed to use his position as president to reap billions of dollars for himself personally and for his family,\u201d Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a speech last week opposing the bill. \u201cThe biggest corruption scandal in modern history is unfolding right now and no one is paying attention to it\u201d.",

    "title": "Minister accused of being too close to big tech after rise in meetings",
    "body": "A senior cabinet minister has been accused of being too close to big tech after analysis showed a surge in his department\u2019s meetings with companies such as Google, Amazon, Apple and Meta since Labour came to power.\n\nAccording to Guardian analysis of publicly available data, Peter Kyle met people close to or representing the sector 28 times in a six-month period. That was more than one meeting every week on average, and nearly 70% more often than his predecessor as science and technology secretary, Michelle Donelan.\n\nThe findings have brought renewed criticism from those who believe Kyle has used his position to push the sector\u2019s agenda even in the face of concerns about online safety and protections for the creative industries.\n\nUKAI, a trade body representing the UK\u2019s artificial intelligence industry, said smaller players were being squeezed out as a consequence of the government\u2019s focus on big tech.\n\n\u201cOur concern is that there is a huge imbalance between a handful of global players who are able to influence directly what No 10 is thinking about on policy, and the thousands of other businesses that make up the AI industry across the UK,\u201d said Tim Flagg, the UKAI chief executive. \u201cOur voice is not being heard but the economic growth that the government seeks will come from these companies.\u201d\n\nLabour has put the technology sector at the heart of much of what it is promising to do in government. Keir Starmer said in a speech earlier this year that artificial intelligence could \u201cturbocharge growth\u201d, and the prime minister is now pursuing a tech-focused trade deal with the US, having last week agreed a range of tariff reductions.\n\nKyle has been at the centre of the government\u2019s outreach to the sector, calling those who work in it \u201cthe bold people building a new future for Britain\u201d.\n\nA Labour source said the figure showed Kyle was \u201cclearly working nearly 70% harder than his predecessors\u201d. They added: \u201cHe is meeting many more inventors, investors and innovators as well as technology companies, victims, campaigners, academics and scientists. That\u2019s the job. And it is a privilege to do it.\u201d\n\nSome in the creative sector blame Kyle for piloting controversial proposals to allow AI companies to circumvent copyright protections and use creative material to train their tools. The Guardian revealed last month that ministers had drawn up concessions to those plans after a backlash from some of the UK\u2019s best-known artists, including Elton John and Paul McCartney.\n\nOn Wednesday, ministers sought to block a Lords amendment to the data bill that would have required AI companies to disclose their use of copyright-protected content.\n\nSome in Labour circles now believe Kyle has become so close to the industry he is supposed to monitor that he will be moved in the next reshuffle, possibly to replace Bridget Phillipson as education secretary.\n\nVictoria Collins, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 science and technology spokesperson, said: \u201cPeter Kyle has rightly got a reputation for being too close to big tech \u2013 unable to defy his friends at Meta and X when it comes to standing up for our kids\u2019 online safety or the rights of British creatives. Kyle rubbing shoulders with so many big US tech bros, instead of our great UK startups trying to get their foot in the door, shows he\u2019s missing a trick.\u201d\n\nCaroline Dinenage, the Conservative chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that [Kyle] is taking a keen interest in the growth of this sector. But he needs to ensure he\u2019s hearing balanced voices from across the high-performance business sectors the UK economy depends upon, to avoid irrevocable unintended consequences of advancing at the expense of others.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the science and technology department said: \u201cAs the department for technology, we make no apologies for regularly engaging with the sector \u2013 one that employs nearly 2 million people in the UK. Regular engagement with technology companies of all sizes is fundamental to delivering economic growth and transforming our public services.\u201d\n\nInformation published by the government shows that from July 2024 until December 2024 \u2013 the most recent period for which there is data \u2013 Kyle held meetings with people representing or advocating for technology companies 28 times.\n\nGoogle, Amazon and Microsoft were present at five of those meetings, the data shows, while Meta attended four.\n\nFive of Kyle\u2019s meetings, all in early August, were to discuss online disinformation and how it had contributed to the spread of violence during that summer\u2019s riots. But apart from that, almost every one was to discuss \u201cinvestment\u201d, \u201copportunities\u201d, or both.\n\nIn August Kyle met all four of those companies, and others from the industry, to discuss AI regulation.\n\nThis year he has met AI companies several times, according to documents obtained under freedom of information rules by the website eu.tech. Those meetings include three with the US AI company Anthropic, as well as a two-day flurry of meetings in February during which he saw executives from OpenAI, the chip designer Arm, Google DeepMind, ElevenLabs and Synthesia.\n\nMany of those meetings were also attended by Matt Clifford, the prime minister\u2019s adviser on AI, who has been criticised for carrying out his role while also holding shares in dozens of AI companies.\n\nEarlier this year the Guardian revealed that the government was delaying its plans to regulate the AI sector.\n\nLast September, Kyle met Tony Blair in a meeting designed to \u201cdiscuss [his department\u2019s] priorities\u201d. However, information obtained by Politico last week under freedom of information laws shows Blair used that meeting to suggest Kyle meet the Ellison Institute of Technology, which is funded by Larry Ellison, the billionaire tech mogul who also funds the Tony Blair Institute.\n\nKyle was also involved in watering down proposals from a Labour backbencher to ban addictive smartphone algorithms aimed at young teenagers.",

    "body": "Naomi Anderson was on leave looking after her young baby when she was told her US Department of Agriculture job helping farmers in developing countries was being cut. A former volunteer with the Peace Corps, which sends young Americans overseas to projects in emerging economies, Anderson had expected to spend her whole career in international development.\n\n\u201cI had taken this job two years ago expecting to stay here for at least 10 years, and you know, we had started to make a community and build up our life here. In January, we had started looking at buying a home,\u201d she says.\n\nNow Anderson is having to consider giving up the apartment in the Washington DC commuter town of Reston, Virginia, that she shares with her husband and their four-month-old baby and almost two-year-old toddler.\n\n\u201cFinancially, it\u2019s a little bit precarious, and honestly we\u2019re not sure what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d says Anderson, who is also an activist with the local branch of the AFSCME union and dabbles in selling political merchandise. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about moving back to Ohio, where I\u2019m from, where my family is. You know, it\u2019s a lot cheaper there.\u201d\n\nAnderson is far from alone. \u201cIn our apartment complex, there\u2019s been lots of yard sales, people selling things and moving away. It really does seem like people are just picking up and leaving, because it\u2019s too expensive to live here without a job,\u201d she says.\n\nTough life-decisions like these have been forced on hundreds of thousands of former federal employees in the past couple of months, as the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge), which is headed up by Donald Trump\u2019s favourite tech billionaire, Elon Musk, has slashed jobs in a cost-cutting spree.\n\nData from the latest monthly Challenger jobs report suggests Doge has been responsible for 281,452 job cuts so far \u2013 almost eight times the number of workers the government let go in the entire year to April 2024.\n\nBrendan Demich is among those to be dismissed, losing his job as an engineer at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. All his colleagues working on mine safety, as well as those in their sister laboratory testing equipment such as respirators, are also leaving \u2013 more than 200 in total \u2013 as part of a wave of cuts initiated by Trump\u2019s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.\n\n\u201cSo many people are devastated,\u201d says Demich, who is a branch representative for the AFGE union. He says so many workers have been removed at once that their colleagues have barely been able to give them any kind of send-off. \u201cIt\u2019s just unceremoniously leaving, because they had their package processed and they had to walk out the door.\u201d\n\nEach of these cuts has its own human impact, but experts are warning of a growing risk that they combine to trigger an economic retrenchment \u2013 particularly in areas with a heavy concentration of government jobs.\n\nView image in fullscreen Liz Shuler: \u2018The economy is being impacted in such a stark way, that ripples out across all of the industries that we represent.\u2019 Photograph: Bonnie Cash/UPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nLiz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO federation of 63 trade unions, which together represent more than 15 million US workers, is trying to build a nationwide campaign to highlight the devastating impact.\n\n\u201cThe trick is connecting the dots because there\u2019s already a national narrative around what\u2019s happening but it\u2019s not quite being felt yet,\u201d Shuler says. \u201cElon [Musk] has his \u2018department of government efficiency\u2019. We established the \u2018department of people who work for a living\u2019. That\u2019s kind of cheeky, but it\u2019s kind of serious, because we\u2019re saying we\u2019re the ones working on the frontlines. We know what\u2019s efficient and what\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cObviously as the labour federation we\u2019re worried about jobs and people\u2019s livelihoods, but it\u2019s also connected to community, and the fact the economy is being impacted in such a stark way, that ripples out across all of the industries that we represent,\u201d she adds.\n\nThese ripples are being felt especially strongly in the towns and counties around Washington DC, where job losses and government cuts crop up constantly in conversation.\n\nKate Bates is the president of the chamber of commerce in affluent Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from the US capital. She compares the current uncertainty to the pandemic, \u201cbut during Covid, the federal government was the backstop, whereas right now it\u2019s the federal government that\u2019s causing a lot of this,\u201d she says.\n\nBates reports that her members are warning of a slowdown across real estate and hospitality, as well as among government contractors, with several reporting they have already had to make job cuts.\n\n\u201cWhat we hear from a lot of people is that if they could plan for the cuts, they would be in an OK position, right? But because things are changing, going back and forth, that\u2019s causing a lot of stress,\u201d she says.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018If the whole year is on the margin then restaurants like ours will go under,\u2019 says the general manager of Arlington\u2019s Barley Mac. Photograph: Greg Kahn/The Guardian\n\nBusinesses that rely on government workers for custom are also feeling the chill. Saamir Nizam, the general manager of Arlington\u2019s Barley Mac restaurant, which is part of a small family-owned chain, has noticed trade declining in just about every one of their usual customer groups.\n\nThe nearby hotels are less occupied; bookings for \u201chappy hour parties\u201d by the accountants and consultants who serve the federal government are down by two-thirds; and many older local residents have been spooked by market volatility.\n\n\u201cWe can only do so much to turn things around: we can\u2019t pull people to Washington, or convince companies to go out and do things,\u201d Nizam says. \u201cBarley Mac serves great food, it gives great service, but it exists, like many restaurants, on the financial margin. And if the whole year is on the margin then restaurants like ours will go under, because we\u2019re not part of a huge national chain which has deep pockets.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Real estate agent Jessica Miller says clients are responding by pulling out of deals and trying to negotiate unusually short leases.

Photograph: Greg Kahn/The Guardian\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no universe in which something like the last few months happens and there\u2019s not serious consequences,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had family friends, we\u2019ve had neighbours lose their jobs, and these are not people who would normally be subject to layoffs. These are people who are at the peak of their career, and hyper-specialised.\u201d\n\nAs far as the business effects are concerned, D\u2019Zmura Friedman says: \u201cCertainly on the commercial side, there\u2019s been hesitancy about launching into things.\u201d\n\nAt her office nearby, Renata Briggman, a residential estate agent, plays down the idea that the housing market in Arlington could be hit, pointing to the many local employers broadly unaffected by federal spending \u2013 such as Amazon, which is headquartered here.\n\nHowever, she does acknowledge signs of change. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely shifting.

Jimmy Olevson, the president and chief executive of National Capital Bank, which serves Washington DC and the surrounding areas, says the bank is not yet seeing signs of financial distress, such as rising arrears, but the mood is \u201cuneasy\u201d. Many customers who have had a recent mortgage application approved seem to have put house-hunting on hold.\n\nSome experts fear this widespread mood of unease bodes badly for the coming months. Analysis by Dr Jo\u00e3o Ferreira, an expert in regional economics at the University of Virginia, suggests more than 320,000 people in the state are employed directly by the federal government \u2013 and another 441,000 jobs depend on taxpayer-funded contracts, of the kind that are being cut.\n\nIn some sectors \u2013 construction, for example \u2013 the same firms fretting about whether their contract will be cut are also contending with the rising price of materials, as a result of tariffs. Although some of the border taxes have been paused or reduced, those restrictions that remain mean costs are still far higher than at the start of the year.\n\nIn theory, the Trump administration could lift the gloom by drawing a line under budget cuts as Musk heads back to his day job running the electric carmaker Tesla. But key members of the cabinet, including Kennedy and the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, have boasted of how much they plan to slash from their budgets \u2013 and White House trade policy continues to see-saw.\n\nFerreira says: \u201cI think, as an economist, I\u2019ve never seen so many things happening at the same time. But they all lead to the same direction, and that\u2019s a recession.\u201d\n\nHe says Virginia has often been cushioned from economic downturns in the past by federal funding, but in this cycle he expects the state to lead the way. \u201cWe definitely might see that Virginia, and other regions like Maryland, will be the frontrunners in this recession period,\u201d Ferreira says.\n\nMeanwhile, for many of the affected individuals, the future looks highly uncertain \u2013 despite the US treasury secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s suggestion they should go work in manufacturing. \u201cFor us on our team, we work in international development,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cWe have a background in humanitarian work, and the Trump administration is trying to cut international foreign aid. So where do you go from there?\u201d",

Which horse are they backing?\u201d\n\nThe BGC played down suggestions of a schism, saying it was aligned with horse racing in opposing harmonised tax rates.\n\n\u201cBGC members contribute \u00a36.8bn to the economy, generate \u00a34bn in tax while supporting 109,000 jobs, but this flawed approach can only lead to a spiral of decline,\u201d said a spokesperson.",

    "body": "Businesses will need to show they are keeping a lid on prices before there can be further interest rate cuts, according to the Bank of England interest rate-setter Catherine Mann.\n\nIn a warning to retailers and consumer goods companies to resist pushing up prices by more than the increase in their costs, Mann said she was wary of firms looking to rebuild their profit margins after a squeeze in recent years.\n\n\n\n\u201cI need to see the loss of pricing power, I need to see that firms are starting to be much more moderate in setting their prices,\u201d she said.\n\nMann, a former chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, was one of two policymakers who voted to hold interest rates at 4.5% at a meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee last week. A majority of five members voted to cut by a quarter point to 4.25%, while two voted for a steeper half-point reduction.\n\nMann has said previously she is ready to cut interest rates steeply once the battle against inflation is won.\n\nHowever, she was concerned that rising levels of goods price inflation was pushing up household expectations of price increases in the months ahead.\n\nShe said there was the prospect of lower import prices from the knock-on effect of Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on countries such as China, despite the 90-day truce announced on Monday, which could cause cheaper exports to be diverted to Britain.\n\n\u201cThere will be some trade diversion that will lead to moderation of import prices in the UK but there\u2019s a lot of margin between the dock and the shelf,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cGoods price inflation is actually going up, not down.\u201d\n\nTrade unions and academic economists accused large firms of using their market power to drive up prices during the pandemic, even when their costs had remained stable or declined. The term \u201cgreedflation\u201d was coined to explain how the price of food and consumer goods continued to rise long after the costs of production had fallen back.\n\nThe Bank\u2019s chief economist, Huw Pill, said earlier this week that he was concerned about a sea change in the labour market that meant higher wages would persist into 2027.\n\nPill, who voted with Mann to freeze interest rates last week, said it was not certain inflation would fall if higher wages become persistent.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC, Mann said Britain\u2019s labour market had been more resilient than expected earlier in the year when she voted to cut interest rates.\n\n\u201cThe first observation is that the labour market has been more resilient. Now, yes, we\u2019ve had some prints that are indicative of a slowing labour market, but it is not a non-linear adjustment,\u201d she said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "body": "Burberry is to cut around 1,700 jobs worldwide by 2027 \u2013 including removing the entire night shift at its Yorkshire raincoat factory \u2013 as the struggling fashion house ramps up its efforts to reduce costs after a tumble in profits.\n\nThe British luxury brand announced the job cuts on Wednesday after reporting a 117% fall in its annual pre-tax profits in the last financial year. It recorded a \u00a366m loss, down from a profit of \u00a3383m, as the company has struggled against a broader malaise in the global luxury goods industry.\n\nThe company said a new plan to find \u00a360m in cost savings could affect 1,700 jobs. Burberry employed about 9,300 people around the world last year, so the cuts could affect almost a fifth of its staff.\n\nJoshua Schulman, the chief executive of Burberry, said most of the cuts would be at the group\u2019s head offices around the world, led by London, but jobs would also go by reorganising staff rotas in stores and dropping one shift at its trench-coat factory in Castleford. He said no significant store closures were planned.\n\nThe change in Castleford, which is expected to affect about 170 highly skilled jobs, will happen before a \u201csignificant investment\u201d in the second half of this year in the factory, Schulman said.\n\n\u201cFor a long time we have had overcapacity at that facility and that\u2019s simply not sustainable at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are making this change to safeguard our UK manufacturing and will be making a significant investment in renovating the Victorian factory [later this financial year].\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Burberry\u2019s Castleford factory in West Yorkshire makes trench coats. Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters\n\nHe said Burberry had \u201can ambition\u201d to increase the scale of UK production \u201cover time\u201d and saw value in the \u201ctradition of making trench coats right here in the UK\u201d.\n\nHowever, Darren Travis, an organiser for GMB union which represents workers at the factory, said: \u201cThis is a sad, sad blow for these workers and Castleford itself. Burberry is the town\u2019s biggest employer and more than a quarter of the workforce are going.\u201d \u201d\n\nThe fashion house, which is best known for its signature trench coats, has struggled in recent years because of a weak luxury market and a series of short-lived attempts to revive the brand with different designers. The company hired Schulman, the former boss of the US fashion brand Coach, as chief executive last year in an attempt to turn around its fortunes.\n\nOne job that appears to be safe as part of Schulman\u2019s revamp is that of the chief creative officer, Daniel Lee, whose role had been seen to be a risk under the new regime.\n\nSchulman said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be happier with the progress our team is making\u201d on moving Burberry from \u201cmodern British luxury to timeless British luxury\u201d and that Lee\u2019s latest collection was \u201can extraordinary expression of timeless British luxury and all of us are very excited about what is to come\u201d.\n\nThe plan to cut costs is on top of a \u00a340m savings programme that Schulman announced in November. Burberry shares jumped by 17% on Wednesday, as the City welcomed the cost-cutting plan.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company partly blamed the drop on lower sales to Chinese tourists and the post-Brexit removal of VAT tax break for tourists shopping in the UK.\n\nSchulman said sales in the US had been \u201cchoppy\u201d in recent months, with a number of ups and downs since the Trump administration took office.\n\nCharlie Huggins, of the investment broker Wealth Club, said the 2025 period had been an \u201cannus horribilis\u201d for Burberry. \u201cLuxury consumers across the globe significantly tightened their belts hitting the whole luxury sector. But Burberry has seen more impact than most,\u201d he said. \u201cIts operational execution has left a lot to be desired in recent years and the brand has lost its lustre, compounding the wider sector\u2019s issues.\u201d\n\nA wider downturn in the luxury goods sector has also hit the sales of bigger rivals such as Kering, which owns brands such as Gucci and Balenciaga, and LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.\n\nBurberry has lost roughly a quarter of its market value over the past year, while LVMH has lost about a third and Kering is down by more than two-fifths.",

    "title": "Firms still greenwashing in adverts after being censured, UK investigation finds",
    "body": "Companies have continued to post misleading greenwashing adverts after being censured by the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA), according to an investigation.\n\nGreenpeace UK\u2019s investigative journalism unit, Unearthed, reports that Virgin Atlantic, Renault and Aqua Pura are among companies that continued to publish unfounded claims about the environmental credentials of their products after being told to remove such adverts by the advertising watchdog.\n\nIn 2021, the ASA announced a greenwashing crackdown, censuring companies for making claims without evidence. It said 44 firms had made misleading advertisements. As recently as last week, at least five of these firms were still posting claims they had been censured for making, according to Unearthed.\n\nASA rules mean advertisers need to be clear about the evidence behind any environmental claims, and a high burden of proof is needed for any absolute claims, such as that a product is \u201csustainable\u201d or \u201ceco-friendly\u201d. The watchdog has few powers to ensure companies comply with their rulings; it says if firms are seen to be ignoring the rules it can \u201csignificantly damage their reputation\u201d. However, it does not have the power to issue fines to advertisers.\n\nSanctions available include naming the company on the ASA website, asking search engines to remove paid search ads that contain the claim, asking social media companies to remove \u201cnon-compliant content\u201d, and taking out its own paid search ads naming the company.\n\nVirgin Atlantic has kept posts \u201cpinned\u201d to the top of its Instagram, TikTok and X accounts, claiming it completed the first transatlantic flight using \u201c100% sustainable aviation fuel\u201d, according to Unearthed. This is despite the ASA making a ruling against the airline nine months ago for this wording in an advert, because it was likely to lead consumers to overestimate the carbon savings of using the fuel \u2013 it thought consumers would interpret \u201c100% sustainable aviation fuel\u201d to mean the fuel was completely sustainable with no negative environmental impact.\n\nRenault repeatedly published videos on Facebook and YouTube last year claiming its hybrid cars offered \u201cup to 80% electric driving in the city\u201d, despite a 2023 ASA ruling finding this wording to be misleading.\n\nOther car manufacturers have continued to make green claims about their vehicles after being censured by the ASA. MG last year promoted its hybrid cars as \u201czero emissions\u201d, but the ASA ruled the claim misleading, as hybrid vehicles are not zero emissions when being powered by petrol or diesel. Electric vehicles are zero emissions only when driving if the electricity that charged them is 100% renewable. An August 2024 brochure for an electric vehicle promoted in an original ad banned by the ASA repeatedly used the term \u201czero emissions\u201d without clarification. Meanwhile, an ad for a used MG4 on the company\u2019s website suggests that drivers can \u201cembrace zero emissions\u201d without clarification.\n\nThe front page of bottled water brand Aqua Pura\u2019s website as recently as last week boasted about its \u201cNEW Environmentally Friendly Caps\u201d, three years after the ASA told the company to stop claiming that plastic bottle lids were \u201ceco-friendly\u201d. Easigrass, which makes plastic lawns, was told by the ASA more than a year ago to stop calling its synthetic grass products \u201ceco-friendly\u201d. However, it has continued to claim on its website that one of its plastic grass products is \u201ceco-friendly and 100% recyclable\u201d. At the time, the watchdog said that there was no proof that plastic grass was \u201ceco friendly\u201d and only one facility in the UK can recycle plastic grass.\n\nAn ASA spokesperson said: \u201cOur world-leading work on climate change and the environment continues to be a priority area and we continue to proactively monitor green claims using our AI-based Active Ad Monitoring system, finding ads that potentially break our rules and getting those that do quickly amended or removed.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing businesses adapting and evolving to make better evidenced, more precise green claims. As an example, following our airline rulings on \u2018sustainable\u2019 and \u2018eco-friendly\u2019 claims, of the circa 140,000 ads monitored, five were found to be non-compliant. But where we find issues, we act; as evidenced by our series of high-profile rulings against a range of businesses including some of the biggest companies in the world.\u201d\n\nA Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to achieving net zero by 2050 and key to this will be using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is one of the most immediate levers to decarbonising long haul aviation. Flight100 was a milestone for industry globally as it proved that SAF is a safe, 100% drop-in replacement for fossil fuel and demonstrated the radical collaboration required to drive increased production, supply and uptake.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

    "title": "Calls for Russia\u2019s frozen assets held in Belgium to be used in rebuilding Ukraine",
    "body": "The boxy glass and steel tower at a traffic-clogged junction on King Albert II Boulevard hardly stands out among the other buildings in the business district of north Brussels, the Belgian capital\u2019s answer to Manhattan or La D\u00e9fense in Paris.\n\nBut unlike its neighbours, the institution housed in this bland postmodern building opposite a branch of Domino\u2019s Pizza is caught up in a geopolitical maelstrom. It is Euroclear, a little-known body that houses most of the Russian state\u2019s frozen assets and now finds itself in the middle of a debate about international justice.\n\nAmid uncertainty about Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to Ukraine, calls are growing to confiscate Russian central bank assets that were frozen after the full-scale invasion. Euroclear holds \u20ac183bn of Russian sovereign funds out of an estimated \u20ac300bn immobilised in western countries.\n\nIn March, about 130 Nobel laureates, including the peace prize winner Oleksandra Matviichuk, called on western governments to release the \u20ac300bn to rebuild Ukraine and compensate war victims. \u201cThis might require new regulations and laws, which, given the undeniable emergency and gross violations of international law, are appropriate and must be amended,\u201d stated the letter, which was signed by some of the world\u2019s leading economists, scientists and writers.\n\nUnder EU law, profits from the Russian funds are used to aid Ukraine, and the next amounts will be revealed when Euroclear announces quarterly results on Wednesday. But the windfall profits \u2013 an estimated \u20ac2.5bn-\u20ac3bn a year \u2013 are modest when set against the \u20ac506bn that Ukraine needs for reconstruction over the next decade. (Since that estimate was published by the World Bank in February, Russia\u2019s deadly missile strikes have continued to wreak a devastating toll.)\n\nThe EU\u2019s most senior diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has backed the idea of using the assets, as have the foreign ministers of Poland and Lithuania. \u201cPutin has already written off the \u20ac300bn assets, he does not expect to get them back. But he also doesn\u2019t think we have the fortitude to take hold of them either. So far, we have proven him right,\u201d said Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, last June.\n\nBut for Belgium\u2019s prime minister, Bart De Wever, confiscating the assets would be \u201can act of war\u201d. Johan Van Overtveldt, a former Belgian finance minister who is De Wever\u2019s political ally, said outright seizure of the assets would be \u201creally playing with fire for the rest of the financial and economic system\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bart De Wever said confiscating the assets would be an \u2018act of war\u2019. Photograph: Isopix/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cEndangering the normal functioning of Euroclear would be a huge problem for the entire European economy, if not for the world economy,\u201d he said.\n\nEuroclear, a Belgian-based international institution, fears it could be sued by the Russian government, while Belgian officials worry that confiscation would trigger a cascade of withdrawals. The end-point of that could even be the collapse of Euroclear, which would be a massive problem for the indebted Belgian government.\n\nBelgium holds a 13% stake in Euroclear and funds its war aid to Ukraine \u2013 including \u20ac1bn announced in April \u2013 from corporate tax take on the profits of the Russian frozen funds. France, which has an 11% stake in Euroclear, is also worried about seizing the assets.\n\nVan Overtveld has another idea: instead of confiscation , he proposes using the assets as collateral to set up \u201cmore elaborate finance\u201d for Ukraine. \u201cIt is complex, but it\u2019s doable, and it does not lead to the same kind of legal issues that you would have if you go for outright seizure.\u201d\n\nEuroclear emphasises its neutrality. \u201cIt is not our role as a neutral financial institution to decide what to do with those [Russian] assets,\u201d said head of communications, Pascal Brabant. \u201cIt will be necessary that any agreement avoids undermining confidence in international financial markets by safeguarding the legal order and legal certainty which underpin global economies.\u201d\n\nOften described as a bank for banks, Euroclear traces its roots to the late 1960s, when it grew out of the Brussels office of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, which later became JP Morgan. At a time when financial transactions were speeding up, Euroclear enabled the electronic exchange of cash and securities (a stock, a bond or some other instrument to raise capital), rather than moving around piles of paper.\n\nToday, Euroclear handles a mind-boggling amount of money \u2013 every four weeks it claims to process transactions equivalent to global GDP, or \u20ac1.3 quadrillion (meaning 1.3 plus 14 zeros) a year. None of this is held in cash. But Euroclear is security conscious. At its headquarters a pair of security cameras are trained on every corner.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A few months earlier Vladimir Putin had secured a third term in office and cracked down brutally on opposition forces that had mounted unprecedented protests against his rule, but Russia\u2019s integration into the global economy was marching on.\n\nAt the time Russian banks were looking for connections to western investors. \u201cProbably all Russian brokers, banks, and even the Russian state held funds through Euroclear,\u201d said Roeland Moeyersons, a business lawyer based in Brussels.\n\nMoeyersons has some Russian clients whose assets or savings are blocked at Euroclear despite the individuals not being sanctioned. His typical client is a millionaire, who fulfils \u201call the cliches\u201d, he said. \u201cThey have a house in Switzerland, one in Russia, a flat in Monaco, Marbella, London or Dubai, and now they are confronted by the fact that a couple of millions of their investments are frozen.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Belgian newspaper De Standaard, Euroclear holds \u20ac70bn in private Russian assets, beyond the \u20ac183bn sovereign funds at the centre of the confiscation debate.\n\nView image in fullscreen Swedish finance minister, Elisabeth Svantesson, said she supported using the assets. Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters\n\nOn behalf of his clients, Moeyersons is calling on Belgium\u2019s treasury to release their assets. While he represents a few Russian billionaires who are challenging their designation on the EU sanctions list, most of his clients are people \u201cwho made a small fortune running a legitimate business\u201d and had their assets frozen \u201cas collateral damage of the EU sanctions,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the debate on the frozen sovereign billions continues. On Tuesday Sweden\u2019s minister for finance, Elisabeth Svantesson, said she supported using the assets and giving Kyiv the right to decide how to spend them. \u201cOf course we need to remain united among our countries, but we are pushing for using them [the frozen funds] in other ways, not only the windfall but also the assets,\u201d she said.\n\nSvantesson was speaking alongside Torbj\u00f6rn Becker, director of the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics, who said transferring the frozen assets to Ukraine would allow Kyiv to buy more weapons and bring economic stability. \u201cIf we were to send the whole amount of these frozen assets to Ukraine they would have predictable long-term financing at the level that matters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should definitely consider transferring all of the frozen assets to Ukraine sooner, rather than later. This is not less important now with [Donald] Trump in the White House.\u201d",
    "summary": "Amid uncertainty about Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to Ukraine, calls are growing to confiscate Russian central bank assets that were frozen after the full-scale invasion.\n\u201cIt is not our role as a neutral financial institution to decide what to do with those [Russian] assets,\u201d said head of communications, Pascal Brabant.\nSvantesson was speaking alongside Torbj\u00f6rn Becker, director of the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics, who said transferring the frozen assets to Ukraine would allow Kyiv to buy more weapons and bring economic stability.\n\u201cIf we were to send the whole amount of these frozen assets to Ukraine they would have predictable long-term financing at the level that matters,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe should definitely consider transferring all of the frozen assets to Ukraine sooner, rather than later.",

    "body": "The problem with the UK, according to the former Google boss Eric Schmidt, is that it has \u201cso many ways that people can say no\u201d.\n\nHowever, for some critics of the Labour government, it has a glaring issue with saying yes: to big tech.\n\nSchmidt made his comment in a Q&A conversation with Keir Starmer at a big investment summit in October last year. The prominent position of a tech bigwig at the event underlined the importance of the sector to a government that has made growth a priority and believes the sector is crucial to achieving it.\n\nTop US tech firms have a big presence in the UK, including Google, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Palantir, the data intelligence firm co-founded by the Maga movement backer Peter Thiel.\n\nIf a government wants growth, then it is hard to look beyond firms with a combined market value of many trillions of dollars.\n\nAccording to one former big-tech employee with knowledge of how the leading US companies further their interests in the UK, such heft brings immediate access.\n\n\u201cWe never had a problem walking the corridors of Whitehall because we could claim to create thousands of jobs and create millions for the economy. Governments love job announcements,\u201d said the ex-employee.\n\nIt is in this context that Peter Kyle, the tech secretary, has met people from the tech sector nearly 70% more often than his predecessor, Michelle Donelan \u2013 at an average of more than one meeting every week. The list includes multiple meetings with Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple.\n\nUKAI, a trade body representing the UK\u2019s artificial intelligence industry, says smaller players are being squeezed out as a consequence.\n\n\u201cOur concerns is that there is a huge imbalance between a handful of global players who are able to influence directly what No 10 is thinking about on policy, and the thousands of other businesses that make up the AI industry across the UK,\u201d says Tim Flagg, UKAI\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOur voice is not being heard, but the economic growth that the government seeks will come from these companies.\u201d\n\nEchoing the former big-tech employee, Flagg adds that big tech firms have the resources allowing them to build and sustain political relationships, \u201cgetting them into the room and concentrating influence at a senior political level\u201d.\n\nAccording to one source who has observed the industry\u2019s interactions with the government, big tech companies also deployed those resources before the general election, allowing them to hit the ground running with established relationships after the Labour landslide.\n\nAnother talks of the Tony Blair Institute\u2019s \u201cphenomenal\u201d access to No 10. The thinktank is backed financially by the tech billionaire Larry Ellison and has been a prominent voice in the debate over AI policy although it says it maintains \u201cintellectual independence over our policy work\u201d.\n\nFor critics of the government\u2019s interaction with big tech, its attempts at reforming copyright law are an exemplar of an imbalanced relationship. Ministers have proposed letting AI companies use copyright-protected work without permission to build their products, unless those copyright holders \u201copt out\u201d of the process in an as-yet undetermined manner.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A campaign against the proposal has been backed by every leading light in the UK\u2019s formidable creative industries, from Paul McCartney to Dua Lipa and Kazuo Ishiguro.\n\nIf tech is the answer to the government\u2019s economic growth problem, then AI is a crucial element of that approach with its promise of runaway improvements in productivity \u2013 a measure of economic efficiency. But the mooted copyright policy has been a PR disaster, if measured in celeb-powered headlines. The News Media Association, which represents news organisations including the Guardian, also opposes the proposal. Google and OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, have come out against the plans as well.\n\nA former government adviser who worked on tech policy says weakening copyright \u2013 which they describe as the \u201clowest hanging fruit\u201d on a list of pro-tech policy options \u2013 isn\u2019t the \u201cmagic answer\u201d to winning the AI race anyway.\n\n\u201cIn taking this approach, government risks the worst of all worlds, which is devastating a sector where the UK is actually world-leading, while not actually taking the actions necessary to make the UK an AI superpower.\u201d\n\nThe department for science, innovation and technology makes \u201cno apologies\u201d for interacting with a sector that employs 2 million people in the UK, according to a spokesperson, adding that \u201cregular engagement\u201d with tech companies of all sizes is fundamental to delivering economic growth.\n\nIn his conversation with Schmidt, Starmer said the key question around policies from now on would be \u201cdoes this promote growth or does it not promote growth?\u201d. The tech industry is at the core of this approach, but in terms of the copyright debate it has damaged important relationships elsewhere.",

    "title": "The Guardian view on Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest: the shadow of kleptocracy | Editorial",
    "body": "Donald Trump\u2019s tour of Gulf nations this week is notionally state business. The president has discussed trade, investment and defence. But the boundary between statecraft and self-aggrandisement is blurred. To honour the US president, the government of Qatar has offered him a Boeing 747 aircraft. This \u201cflying palace\u201d, worth around $400m, would serve as a substitute for Air Force One as Mr Trump\u2019s personal jumbo.\n\nThe US constitution explicitly forbids anyone holding a government office from accepting any \u201cpresent, emolument, office or title\u201d from foreign powers without congressional consent. White House lawyers, obedient to their master, say the Qatari jet doesn\u2019t cross that line.\n\nAccepting gifts from foreign regimes is not the worst constitutional violation committed by the Trump administration. The contempt for due process and rule of law in cases where innocent Americans have been abducted and deported for unproven and spurious immigration offences is more alarming.\n\nBut corrosion of civil rights and flouting rules of financial propriety are symptoms of the same condition. Mr Trump doesn\u2019t believe in submission to rules of any kind. He recognises no distinction between business conducted in the White House and deals done at Mar-a-Lago. On the eve of his inauguration, Mr Trump launched a crypto asset, $TRUMP, literally monetising the presidency. Last month, it was announced that the top 220 holders of the coin would be invited to dinner with the president.\n\nPrevious occupants of the Oval Office sold investments or set them aside in blind trusts. Mr Trump\u2019s business empire, managed by his sons, operates as before, except with the added commercial privileges that accrue to association with the most powerful man on Earth. Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, runs a private equity company that mostly deals with the state-backed investment funds of Gulf states that Mr Trump is visiting this week.\n\nThe conflicts of interest are so densely woven that it is difficult to separate the presidency from the commercial ambitions of the presidential entourage. That is a defining feature of state capture in regimes that lack democratic safeguards and where law enforcement is incapable of policing corruption. It is an affront to the principle that public office should be sought with a view to advancing public interest, not exploited for personal enrichment. It is the mark of a kleptocracy.\n\nThat is not incompatible with the more ideological side of Mr Trump\u2019s project \u2013 the promise to make America great again. The president sees himself as a champion of the American people \u2013 an incarnation of a national will \u2013 so his soaring wealth is synonymous with collective greatness. But if ordinary Americans do not feel themselves enriched, they will turn resentful, perhaps wanting regime change, at which point the president may feel threatened by democracy and seek to disarm it.\n\nThis is the cycle of authoritarianism permitting corruption, which in turn feeds more authoritarianism. Plenty of dysfunctional states have exhibited this pattern before, but rarely has it been displayed on a scale and a stage as vast as those available to a US president.",

    "body": "Name: The 52-hour work week.\n\nAge: Relatively new \u2013 our hunter-gatherer ancestors probably only worked for 15 hours a week.\n\nAppearance: Frazzled.\n\nHow much is a 52-hour week, exactly? It works out to 10.4 hours a day, five days a week.\n\nMad. And stupid.\n\nYou\u2019d have to be, right? A new study suggests those working more than 52 hours could suffer effects including \u201cemotional instability or reduced cognitive efficiency in the longer term\u201d.\n\nSo working too hard is bad for you. I\u2019m shocked. Previous studies have shown that overwork leads to stress, anxiety and reduced cognitive function. But the new study, published in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine, also shows that working too hard produces physical changes in the brain.\n\nWhat kind of changes? Increased brain volume in specific areas associated with executive function \u2013 cognitive skills \u2013 and emotional regulation in those working more than 52 hours a week, when compared with a non-overworked group.\n\nSo the more I work, the smarter and more emotionally regulated I get. That could be happening in the short term, but other studies have shown such increases in grey matter can have a negative impact on executive function.\n\nWhy have they settled on 52 hours? The study examined the brains of healthcare workers in South Korea, where the Korean Labour Standards Act identifies 52 hours a week as the critical threshold for increased health risk. Other studies have used 55 hours.\n\nWhat about Britain? How much is too much? In the UK it\u2019s illegal to make someone work more than 48 hours per week.\n\nNot just illegal, but almost impossible \u2013 you\u2019d probably have to come in on Fridays! But 48 hours is an average, normally calculated over 17 weeks. And there are exceptions.\n\nWhat kind of exceptions? Those working in the armed forces, emergency services and police, for example.\n\nJust the sort of people you\u2019d want to have tip-top cognitive function, ironically. You can also opt out of the 48-hour week and work more hours, as long as you confirm that in writing.\n\nI would consider doing that, if I was able to secure my dream job. What is your dream job?\n\nTesting mattresses. I think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s more difficult than it sounds.\n\nDo say: \u201cI worked hard to get where I am today \u2013 emotionally unstable and cognitively impaired.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cDo you ever do studies on people who work fewer than 20 hours a week? Because I\u2019d like to sign up.\u201d",

    "body": "View image in fullscreen Illustration: Angelica Alzona/Guardian Design; source images via Getty Images\n\nThe Cybertruck answers a question no one in the auto industry even thought to ask: what if there was a truck that a Chechen warlord couldn\u2019t possibly pass up \u2013 a bulletproof, bioweapons-resistant, road rage-inducing street tank that\u2019s illegal to drive in most of the world?\n\nFew had seen anything quite like the Cybertruck when it was unveiled in 2019. Wrapped in an \u201cultra-hard, 30X, cold-rolled stainless steel exoskeleton\u201d, the Cybertruck was touted as the ultimate doomsday chariot \u2013 a virtually indestructible, obtuse-angled, electrically powered behemoth that can repel handgun fire and outrun a Porsche while towing a Porsche, with enough juice leftover to power your house in the event of a blackout. At the launch, Tesla\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, said the truck could tackle any terrain on Earth and possibly also on Mars \u2013 and all for the low, low base price of $40,000. \u201cSometimes you get these late-civilization vibes [that the] apocalypse could come along at any moment,\u201d Musk said. \u201cHere at Tesla, we have the best in apocalypse technology.\u201d\n\nSix years on, Covid and Musk\u2019s political alignment with Donald Trump have kicked up the apocalypse vibes, and Tesla\u2019s good sense has only become more questionable as the Cybertruck has been reduced to an object of universal scorn and derision further raising a host of questions: is the Cybertruck even a decent doomsday chariot? Could it really survive end times? Will it survive Musk himself? \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s a heavy-duty vehicle that can take some punishment, even from small arms fire,\u201d says Arthur Bradley, a prepping expert who oversees the building of satellite systems at Nasa\u2019s Langley research center in Virginia. \u201cBut you can\u2019t weigh the pros without also asking: \u2018Are people shooting at me because they think I\u2019m an idiot or a bad guy, or they don\u2019t support my political views \u2013 or they don\u2019t support me supporting this company?\u2019\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Elon Musk introduces the Cybertruck at Tesla\u2019s design studio in Hawthorne, California, on 21 November 2019. The windows were broken during a demonstration intended to show the strength of the glass. Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/AP\n\nPost-armageddon transport has a simple but specific brief: be tough, durable and drive through anything \u2013 and no vehicle ticks those boxes more reliably than trucks. Fictional concepts such as Mad Max\u2019s tanker-based War Rig are often the inspiration for real-world creations like Ford\u2019s custom-built F650 Supertruck, a tractor-trailer sized monstrosity that can carry 120 gallons of fuel, tow 30,000lb, and be reinforced with bulletproof armor. The truck is how insurgent fighters get around war zones and what storm chasers use to run down tornadoes. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly pretty good for prepping purposes,\u201d says Sean Gold, a former air force emergency manager who has worked in the prepping industry for nearly a decade. \u201cThey\u2019re large, off-road-capable, able to get off roads that might be congested \u2013 that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nI have never physically felt the air leave a room in the way that it did when the Cybertruck rolled out on stage Simone Giertz, DIY robotics inventor\n\nThe Cybertruck, however, broke from a century\u2019s worth of truck-building orthodoxy, eschewing the typical three-box layout for a wedge-shaped silhouette that took inspiration from the movie Blade Runner and cyberpunk motifs. It mocked the F-150, the US\u2019s top-selling vehicle for the last 47 years, as prehistoric tech. On its website, Tesla featured imaginative images of the Cybertruck crawling around Mars. Few knew what to make of it. Simone Giertz, a DIY robotics inventor who built a Tesla truck on her popular YouTube channel, was among a select group invited to Tesla\u2019s Hawthorne, California, studio for the Cybertruck unveiling. \u201cI have never physically felt the air leave a room in the way that it did when the Cybertruck rolled out on stage,\u201d she recalls. \u201cPeople were so confused.\u201d\n\nSince Musk\u2019s hard-right turn, however, the Cybertruck\u2019s design has gone from aesthetically polarizing to politically so. A recent Slate article nods at the truck\u2019s uncanny resemblance to the Casspir, the apartheid-era military transport that patrolled South African townships in Musk\u2019s boyhood. \u201cAs violence and flames engulfed the streets of the nation, Black South African children drew and wrote about the apartheid security forces and its tools \u2013 dogs and Casspirs \u2013 chasing and shooting at them in their schools, streets, and homes,\u201d the article says. \u201cBy the 1990s, the Casspir had become an iconic global symbol of apartheid oppression.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Casspirs, armored personnel carriers used by South Africa\u2019s army and police, patrol the streets of a township before the nation\u2019s first democratic election in 1994. Photograph: Peter Turnley/Corbis/VCG/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then that the Cybertruck would become a status symbol for security forces. One California police department spent $153,000 on a Cybertruck for \u201ccommunity outreach efforts\u201d (though it didn\u2019t rule out using it to \u201crespond to emergencies\u201d as needed), and a Chechen warlord showed off a machine-gun mounted Cybertruck he claimed was purpose-built to help his army fight alongside Russia in the Ukraine war. \u201cI am sure that this \u2018beast\u2019 will bring a lot of benefit to our fighters,\u201d Ramzan Kadyrov said while heaping praise on \u201cthe respected Elon Musk\u201d, who has denied making the vehicle for Kadyrov. Ultimately, the Cybertruck had to be towed from the battlefield after randomly shutting down on Chechen forces, and Kadyrov accused Musk of switching it off remotely \u2013 a nagging concern among Tesla owners.\n\nIn Tesla\u2019s early days, the catastrophe thinking was small \u2013 a \u201cbioweapon defense mode\u201d button on each vehicle\u2019s climate control, something Musk reckoned might come in handy \u201cif there\u2019s ever an apocalyptic scenario of some kind\u201d. But even as Musk\u2019s winking references to the apocalypse manifested into a bulletproof rig made of stainless steel, there was no denying that he may have been right to think the Cybertruck could be a hit with consumers. After the 2019 unveiling, Tesla received about 2m preorders from customers plonking down $100 each. But in the end the enthusiasm wouldn\u2019t last because Musk couldn\u2019t keep his promises.\n\nThe Cybertruck came to market two years too late, which was time that allowed Tesla\u2019s rivals to get in the game; more Cybertruck reservation holders might have hung in there if Musk hadn\u2019t marked the truck\u2019s base price up to $99,000. Perhaps most detrimental for Tesla: the Cybertruck\u2019s purported utility appeared to be worse than advertised. The average truck is undergirded with a steel frame to handle the rigors of hauling and towing \u2013 but the Cybertruck\u2019s underbody is made of aluminum, much lighter metal that can bend and even break under heavy strain. Stainless steel is also susceptible to rust \u2013 which is to say the Cybertruck is an iffy proposition to survive regular winter, let alone nuclear winter.\n\nThe internet teems with video of the Cybertruck spinning its wheels in a snowy parking space, on the beach and farther off the beaten path; meanwhile the Rivian R1T, a legitimately capable electric vehicle rival to the Cybertruck, was apparently no worse for wear after being tossed around during Hurricane Helene. (\u201cWhat a dream marketing opportunity for Rivian,\u201d Giertz says. \u201cYour truck actually survived a natural disaster.\u201d)\n\nDan Neil, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning car critic, slid off a hill while test-driving the Cybertruck with his teenage daughter. \u201cWe took it on class three and class four trails, which it is technically capable of,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s also 2ft wider than any trail at any national park could generally accommodate. That\u2019s the part I don\u2019t get. It\u2019s definitely an on-road car.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Police officers stand near a Cybertruck as people protest against a rally by Elon Musk, who is supporting a conservative state supreme court candidate, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on 30 March 2025. Photograph: Vincent Alban/Reuters\n\nThat makes the Cybertruck an even tougher sell to doomsday preppers \u2013 many of whom already had their doubts about the viability of EV technology during and after a major disaster, says Gold, the former air force manager. The Cybertruck\u2019s 300ish-mile range in particular becomes a much riskier proposition when plugs stop working. \u201cThe beauty of EVs is you don\u2019t have to hunt for fuel,\u201d says Bradley, the Virginia-based prepping expert. \u201cBut the drawback is most people don\u2019t have a large solar power generation system. If you get a little too far out, or run into a situation that causes you to use up your energy, you might not get back home.\u201d\n\nDaisy Luther, a former automotive service manager who went into the prepping business after the 2008 financial collapse, wonders how anyone in the post-apocalypse would go about fixing a Cybertruck (which has already been recalled eight times) \u2013 especially in the event of an electromagnetic pulse or similar event. \u201cI generally recommend that if someone is getting a vehicle to last them through some kind of apocalyptic situation that it have as few computer chips and electronics as possible,\u201d says Luther, who drives an old Jeep. \u201cI can do small repairs on something mechanical, but I can\u2019t do anything that requires a computer flash or a satellite upgrade because I don\u2019t have the equipment.\u201d\n\nLast month I rented a Tesla Cybertruck to get a feel for it as a family vehicle and found it to be ill-equipped for these times, let alone the end times. (And I say that as the owner of a Model Y, an exceedingly versatile family hauler that\u2019s also massively fun to drive.) At over 6ft wide, 18ft long and 3.5 tons, the Cybertruck was a bear to maneuver around Atlanta\u2019s narrow streets; its obtuse-angled shape made identifying traffic hazards through the car\u2019s windows and mirrors a virtual impossibility. Even when I find myself considering the Cybertruck just for its potential as a standby home generator, I was soon reminded that Hyundai and Kia EVs offer similar capability for a fraction of the cost.\n\nI don\u2019t think that [Doge] is the issue. Actually, it\u2019s that people despise Elon Musk even more than they hate Trump Ross Gerber, Tesla investor\n\nFor my toddler boys the Cybertruck is what the Lamborghini Countach was to me in my youth, the apogee of poster cars \u2013 but the truck isn\u2019t what I would call kid-friendly. Mostly, it kept me worried about them gouging out an eye, losing a finger or getting static shock from touching the steel doors as they explored.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re driving a meme car!\u201d Ezra Dyer, the Car and Driver columnist, helpfully reminds me. \u201cYou have to buy into the idea that it\u2019s kind of funny, wink-wink.\u201d When my wife asked if the children would be safe inside, I hesitated to tell her that Alijah Arenas \u2013 the highly regarded USC basketball recruit and son of former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas \u2013 had to be put into a coma after losing control of his Cybertruck and crashing into a fire hydrant in Los Angeles. Suffice to say, had Alijah Arenas been driving a Rivian (the safest pickup on the road full stop) or Tiger Woods\u2019s 2009 Escalade, he would have been able to walk away from the accident; but somehow, bystanders managed to pry open the Cybertruck\u2019s doors, which don\u2019t have exterior handles (!), and pull him away from a fiery scene made scarier by the truck\u2019s tough to extinguish high-voltage battery \u2013 the last thing you\u2019d want to deal with when the world\u2019s already burning.\n\nView image in fullscreen A Cybertruck is parked with other Tesla vehicles on the south lawn driveway in front of the White House in Washington DC on 11 March 2025. Trump has said he will buy a Tesla to support the company and Elon Musk after recent calls for boycotts of Tesla products. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nUnlike modern cars, the Cybertruck was expressly not designed to deform on impact \u2013 further ratcheting up the safety risks during and after a cataclysmic disaster. (This is also why Cybertrucks are banned in the UK, EU and China, the world\u2019s largest EV market.) Gold, who drives a Model 3, could envision a bad actor hacking into the truck remotely or even Musk himself shutting them down out of spite as may or may not have been the case with the Chechen warlord. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t really make sense [for him to do that],\u201d Gold says, \u201cbut the possibility is concerning\u201d.\n\nThen there\u2019s Gold\u2019s point: the Cybertruck is such a ripe target, it sticks out so much. Early on the Ford CEO, Jim Farley, dismissed it as the kind of status mobile you might find \u201cparked in front of a hotel\u201d. In its relatively short life, the Cybertruck has gone from being a status mobile for Kim Kardashian, Pharrell Williams and other tastemakers to the ultimate meme-mobile \u2013 a Maga hat on wheels. (SNL\u2019s Colin Jost called it the answer to the question: \u201cWhat if Kanye was a car?\u201d) When the truck isn\u2019t being flipped off in traffic (although that wasn\u2019t my experience driving it in Atlanta, a saturated Tesla market), it\u2019s being used as a slate canvas for political protests against Musk. \u201cI mean, I wouldn\u2019t want to drive one around town today,\u201d Bradley says.\n\nRead more from The Armageddon complex series\n\nThe irony of Tesla\u2019s apocalypse machine is it couldn\u2019t even overcome Musk\u2019s worst nature, or even live up to the Earth-saving principles that Tesla used to espouse. \u201cMaybe this explains it: he\u2019s working really hard on bringing down civil society; maybe that was just to increase the market?\u201d Giertz jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because when the environmentalists turned on Elon, he immediately pivoted to another target group: the preppers who want to be self-sufficient. But at this point when civility is out the window and we are even more pissed at the guy who brought the apocalypse in, I\u2019d rather be in a Toyota Prius than a Cybertruck.\u201d\n\nOn the company\u2019s earnings call last month Musk vowed to step back from running the so-called \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (Doge) to devote more time to Tesla amid speculation that he could be replaced as CEO \u2013 but the catastrophe may be unsalvageable. \u201cI don\u2019t think that [Doge] is the issue,\u201d Ross Gerber, a major Tesla investor, told CNN. \u201cActually, it\u2019s that people despise Elon Musk even more than they hate Trump. And that\u2019s not something that he can solve at this point.\u201d\n\nDespite being the world\u2019s top selling EV pickup, Cybertruck sales are still so poor that the company doesn\u2019t even bother reporting them \u2013 but record high inventory and steep depreciation curves give the game away. Quietly, Tesla shifted marketing strategies for the Cybertruck, pivoting away from the Martian imagery to more classic pickup truck iconography \u2013 but it\u2019s too little, too late, and now just gaslighting the public. In recent months Tesla\u2019s board chair made $198m unloading the company\u2019s stock amid falling profits. Ford, Rivian and other competitors are fast gaining ground in the market. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see how far Tesla has fallen,\u201d says Benoit. \u201cAt this point it\u2019s beyond political.\u201d\n\nIf anything, the Cybertruck becoming the Titanic of cars is the fate we actually should\u2019ve prepared for. History tells us anytime a vehicle is touted as future-proof, it\u2019s all but doomed to become a monument to unchecked hubris. \u201cMy guess is this incarnation of the Cybertruck has a very limited life,\u201d Bradley says. \u201cI think there will be another Cybertruck, but it will probably be more modern-looking \u2013 like a regular pickup truck.\u201d",

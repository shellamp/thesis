A0001,2024-06-30,316,"More companies are staying quiet during Pride, but money is still flowing to LGBTQ+ causes",CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/30/pride-month-more-companies-stay-quiet-but-donations-keep-flowing.html,parade participants are seen marching during the 2024 kentuckiana pride parade on june 15 2024 in louisville kentucky stephen j cohen getty images pride month is winding down — and this year the corporate world took a more cautious approach june tends to bring a wave of rainbowthemed merchandise and affirming ads and social media posts from retailers and consumers brands coinciding with parades and other events that celebrate the lgbtq community as the presidential election approaches however some companies have grown quieter about diversity equity and inclusion efforts to avoid stepping into the culture wars or facing the blowback from conservative customers that target and bud light did a year ago the starkest example of that came late thursday tractor supply a retailer that sells animal feed cowboy boots and lawn supplies in rural parts of the country said it is ending all spending tied to diversity and environmental causes that includes no longer sponsoring pride festivals the statement said the move while an outlier in its magnitude underscores how some companies that made inclusion commitments in recent years are treading cautiously it is difficult to track how many companies shared supportive messages donated to lgbtq causes or sold rainbowthemed merchandise in june compared to previous years according to gravity research a washington dcbased reputational research firm 45 of fortune 100 companies had at least one social media post on linkedin or x explicitly related to pride as of june 21 this year compared with 51 last june gravity research president luke hartig said the volatility of the presidential election and the two candidates willingness to call out companies by name has also made companies less likely to go public about their stand theres a little bit of like keep our heads down while we go through this election he said tim bennett cofounder of tribury productions a marketing company that specializes in reaching lgbtq americans works with fortune 500 companies including recent projects with procter gamble he said more clients have taken a waitandsee approach to marketing to lgbtq consumers or decided to scatter efforts throughout the year instead of making a big splash in a single month june this year has not been like the last five or six bennett said that may not be a bad thing for lgbtq initiatives and charities sarah kate ellis ceo of nonprofit advocacy group glaad said shes seeing more companies get involved with yearround philanthropy and activism in more meaningful ways she also pointed to a survey by gravity research that found that 78 of companies did not plan to change their pride strategy this year thirteen percent were unsure whether theyd make changes and 9 said they planned to revise their strategy gravity research surveyed 45 corporate executives and fortune 500 leaders across industries in april the visibility of companies putting flags out and having product to celebrate our pride and to mark a month thats really significant and important for our community is really important and i dont want to ever devalue that ellis said i do think though those companies must look inside and make sure that they have the policies and the hr practices that match their outward marketing major companies are still writing checks for lgbtq causes too a glaad spokesperson said friday that the group has not seen donations or corporate support decline this pride month though it does not yet have a total tally on friday when the stonewall national monument visitor center officially opened its doors to commemorate the new york city bar that was a catalyst in the lgbtq rights movement the event had major backing from the business community supporters included google amazon jpmorgan chase and bookingcom president joe biden also made an appearance and remarks at the monuments opening pride month merchandise is displayed at a target store on may 31 2023 in san francisco california justin sullivan getty images the bud light and target effect consumer staples brands were the most likely to say they planned to shift their pride month strategy this year according to gravity researchs survey that may stem from the conservative boycotts of target and bud light last year target has carried a pride collection for over a decade yet last year the bigbox retailer removed some items and moved displays after employees faced threats boycotters targeted items for transgender shoppers such as tuckfriendly swimsuits and also criticized separate pride merchandise for kids instead of putting pride merchandise in all stores this year target only carried it in the locations that accounted for 90 of total pride sales in 2022 and 2023 it also stopped selling any pride apparel for kids on the companys website and in those select stores shoppers can find a wide variety of pridethemed items the volume of negative feedback to the pride collection externally and internally is significantly lower this year than in 2023 according to a target spokesperson in a statement target said it is committed to supporting the lgbtqia community during pride month and yearround and would participate in pride events across the country and support lgbtq groups in addition to offering pride products a sign disparaging bud light beer is seen along a country road on april 21 2023 in arco idaho anheuserbusch the brewer of bud light has faced backlash after the company sponsored two instagram posts from a transgender woman natalie behring getty images anheuserbusch inbev and other large beer brands on the other hand have backed away from public support of the lgbtq community conservatives like singer kid rock and florida gov ron desantis called for a boycott of the beer and its parent company anheuserbusch inbev after bud light sent personalized cans of its beer to transgender influencer dylan mulvaney the marketing campaign coincided with the march madness college basketball tournament bud light sales tumbled around 25 and the brand lost its spot as the bestselling beer in the us ceding the position it held for more than two decades to constellation brands modelo ab inbev distanced itself from mulvaney and fired bud lights vice president of marketing in october ab inbev ceo michel doukeris said the brand would focus its marketing more on events like sports games and concerts it also returned as the official sponsor of the ufc in recent months some consumers have returned to bud light as rbc europe analysts estimate that the brands us volume is down only about 10 these days for its part bud light hasnt posted in support of pride month on its instagram or x pages this year the boycott was unusually sticky for a few reasons according to neil reid a geography professor at the university of toledo who researches the beer industry studies have shown that consumers loyalty to topselling beers may be more tied to the brand than the taste reid said rightwing news outlets like fox news also devoted plenty of airtime to the controversy stretching its duration and potentially reaching new consumers who missed the initial reaction plus once bud light sales fell retailers gave more shelf space to its rivals you can look at this issue from a moral ethical perspective or you can also look at it from a pure business perspective those two often dont result in the same strategy reid said the new york stock exchange welcomes

stocks create free account jensen huang cofounder and chief executive officer of nvidia corp displays the new blackwell gpu chip during the nvidia gpu technology conference on march 18 2024 david paul morrisbloomberg via getty images the us stock market has become dominated by about a handful of companies in recent years some experts question whether that concentrated market puts investors at risk though others think such fears are likely overblown lets look at the sp 500 the most popular benchmark for us stocks as an illustration of the dynamics at play the top 10 stocks in the sp 500 the largest by market capitalization accounted for 27 of the index at the end of 2023 nearly double the 14 share a decade earlier according to a recent morgan stanley analysis watch now in other words for every 100 invested in the index about 27 was funneled to the stocks of just 10 companies up from 14 a decade ago that rate of increase in concentration is the most rapid since 1950 according to morgan stanley it has increased more in 2024 the top 10 stocks accounted for 37 of the index as of june 24 according to factset data the socalled magnificent seven — apple amazon alphabet meta microsoft nvidia and tesla — make up about 31 of the index it said a bit riskier than people realize some experts fear the largest us companies are having an outsized influence on investors portfolios for example the magnificent seven stocks accounted for more than half the sp 500s gain in 2023 according to morgan stanley just as those stocks helped push up overall returns a downturn in one or many of them could put a lot of investor money in jeopardy some said for example nvidia shed more than 500 billion in market value after a recent threeday selloff in june dragging down the sp 500 into a multiday losing streak the stock has since recovered a bit the sp 500s concentration is a bit riskier than people realize said charlie fitzgerald iii a certified financial planner based in orlando florida nearly a third of the sp 500 is sitting in seven stocks he said youre not diversifying when youre concentrating like this why stock concentration may not be a concern the sp 500 tracks stock prices of the 500 largest publicly traded companies it does so by market capitalization the larger a firms stock valuation the larger its weighting in the index techstock euphoria has helped drive higher concentration at the top particularly among the magnificent seven collectively magnificent seven stocks are up about 57 in the past year as of market close on june 27 — more than double the 25 return of the whole sp 500 chip maker nvidias stock alone has tripled in that time more from personal finance americans struggle to shake off a vibecession retirement super savers have the biggest 401k balances households have seen their buying power grow despite the sharp increase in stock concentration some market experts believe the concern may be overblown for one many investors are diversified beyond the us stock market its rare for 401k investors to own just a us stock fund for example according to a recent analysis by john rekenthaler vice president of research at morningstar many invest in targetdate funds a vanguard tdf for nearretirees has a roughly 8 weighting to the magnificent seven while one for younger investors who aim to retire in about three decades has a 135 weighting rekenthaler wrote in may theres precedent for this market concentration additionally the current concentration isnt unprecedented by historical or global standards according to the morgan stanley analysis research by finance professors elroy dimson paul marsh and mike staunton shows that the top 10 stocks made up about 30 of the us stock market in the 1930s and early 1960s and about 38 in 1900 the stock market was as concentrated or more around the late 1950s and early 60s for example a period when stocks did just fine said rekenthaler whose research examines markets since 1958 weve been here before he said and when we were here before it wasnt particularly bad news when there were big market crashes they generally dont appear to have been associated with stock concentration he added when compared with the worlds dozen largest stock markets the us market was the fourthmostdiversified at the end of 2023 — better than that of switzerland france australia germany south korea the united kingdom taiwan and canada morgan stanley said sometimes you can be surprised big us companies also generally seem to have the profits to back up their current lofty valuations unlike during the peak of the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s experts said presentday market leaders generally have higher profit margins and returns on equity than those in 2000 according to a recent goldman sachs research report the magnificent seven are not pieinthesky companies theyre generating tremendous revenue for investors said fitzgerald principal and founding member of moisand

across the country are starting to change how they make drink orders among other tweaks designed to reduce bottlenecks and long wait times that have dogged the chain the overhaul comes as the coffee giant prepares for an anticipated swell of orders through its mobile app at the heart of the plan is starbucks siren craft system a series of processes that are aimed at making baristas jobs easier and speeding up service times for customers starbucks said more than 10 of its 10000 stores have already implemented the system which includes changing the production order for hot and cold drinks it will be in use across north america by the end of july according to the company executives hope the changes will provide a muchneeded jolt to starbucks in april the company reported a disappointing second quarter as us samestore sales fell 3 and traffic dropped 7 the coffee chain cut its 2024 outlook starbucks reported rates of incomplete mobile app orders in the midteens and said occasional customers came in less ceo laxman narasimhan mentioned the need to make improvements to stores katie young senior vice president of store operations at starbucks said the most immediate shift that needed to happen in cafes was better handling the unexpected its the ability to flexibly respond to things we cannot predict she told cnbc in an interview starbucks coffee shop in krakow poland on february 29 2024 beata zawrzel nurphoto getty images the store changes will be key this month as starbucks on monday started opening up its app to nonrewards members which the company believes will increase traffic and orders analyst peter saleh managing director at btig said my sense is that they have a lot of demand in certain stores and the footprint of the kitchen is so small you have to find ways to be more efficient losing customers because of slow orders and other store frustrations could cost starbucks at a particularly vulnerable time americans have become cost conscious in the face of ongoing inflation and in some cases have pulled back on morning or afternoon beverages and snacks narasimhan in april said consumers are spending more cautiously starbucks has done something uncharacteristic in recent weeks joining the stream of value offerings with a 5 food and beverage combo option communicating value to customers is also part of the plan to drum up business the siren system starbucks has been diagnosing the bottleneck issue for more than a year since the companys reinvention plan rollout in 2022 said young at the time howard schultz was at the helm having returned during a burgeoning unionization movement and shifts in consumer preferences the changes underway in cafes were first previewed that fall to be rolled out in the years to come narasimhan took over for schultz in march 2023 the siren system processes were developed with worker feedback on which issues stopped them from creating beverages and connecting with customers starbucks said it plans to add a role akin to an expediter in a restaurant production line a play caller who steps away from production and helps solve logjams in cafes handling tasks such as restocking cups or helping when an unexpected crowd arrives the company plans to train existing workers for the role or potentially add new baristas if needed one of the pain points we saw was that our espresso machine was often running all the time and that was one of the things that kept our partners from being able to check in and another thing we saw that you didnt necessarily know was which part of the store would get crowded young said we needed to actually have a partner that was dedicated when things got busy to pulling out of production and just helping starbucks said it will also change the order in which beverages are made previously cold drinks were prioritized from start to finish even if a hot beverage order came in first as pulling espresso shots was the last step this could create a traffic jam in the drivethru for example if a person ordered one of each beverage as the cold item would be ready while the hot drink was still in production macoy mclaughlin manager of seattles first and walker starbucks location said producing beverages in the order they were placed allows for a faster streamlined process we actually have proper sequencing between our hot and cold bars versus cold bars becoming as popular as ever to really have a consistent experience for the customers so were actually making them in the order theyre coming in mclaughlin said adding that the cafe feels busier but customers in store and in the drivethru are getting drinks faster baristas also will have more control over the companys digital production manager an ipad system that controls the sequencing of orders in various channels from cafes mobile orders and the drivethru the company said workers will have more flexibility over changing order priority starbucks app expands,,,,,,,,Very Old

A0026,2024-07-01,315,The fastest data in the world,BBC Business,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clkkllxm4jzo,the fastest data in the world 5 days ago by chris baraniuk technology reporter share surf mission accomplished for edwin verheul left and joachim opdenakker in february deep inside a warehouse at cern the swiss home of the large hadron collider lhc – the world’s biggest science experiment – two network engineers held their breath and pressed a button suddenly text on a black background flashed up on a screen in front of them it had worked “there was highfiving involved” recalls joachim opdenakker at surf a dutch it association that works for educational and research institutions “it was supercool to see” he and his colleague edwin verheul had just set up a new data link between the lhc in switzerland and data storage sites in the netherlands a data link that could reach speeds of 800 gigabits per second gbps – or more than 11000 times the average uk home broadband speed the idea is to improve scientists’ access to the results of lhc experiments a subsequent test in march using special equipment on loan from nokia proved the desired speeds were achievable “this transponder that nokia uses it’s like a celebrity” says mr verheul explaining how the kit is booked up for use at various locations in advance “we had limited time to do tests if you have to postpone a week then the transponder is gone” this amount of bandwidth approaching one terabit per second is extremely fast but some subsea cables are a few hundred times faster still – they use multiple fibre strands to achieve such speeds nokia surf after its upgrade the large hadron collider will produce five times as much data in labs around the world networking experts are coming up with fibre optic systems capable of pushing data around even more rapidly than this they are reaching extraordinary speeds of many petabits per second pbps or 300 million times the average uk home broadband connection this is so fast that one can barely imagine how people will use such bandwidth in the future but engineers are wasting no time in proving that it is possible and they only want to go faster the duplex cable with cores that either send or receive from cern to data centres in the netherlands is just shy of 1650km i025 miles long snaking from geneva to paris then brussels and finally amsterdam part of the challenge in reaching 800 gbps was in beaming pulses of light such a long way “due to the distance the power levels of that light decrease so you have to amplify it at different locations” explains mr opdenakker every time one tiny subatomic particle smashes into another during experiments at the lhc the impact generates staggering volumes of data – about one petabyte per second that’s enough to fill 220000 dvds this is slimmed down for storage and study but still requires hefty amounts of bandwidth plus with an upgrade due by 2029 the lhc expects to produce even more scientific data than it does today “the upgrade increases the number of collisions by at least a factor of five” says james watt senior vice president and general manager of optical networks at nokia a time when 800 gbps seems slow may not be far away however in november a team of researchers in japan broke the world speed record for data transmission when they reached an astonishing 229 pbps that’s enough bandwidth to supply every single person on the planet and then a couple billion more with a netflix stream says chigo okonkwo at eindhoven university of technology who was involved in the work in this case a meaningless but huge stream of pseudorandom data was beamed over 13km of coiled fibre optic cable in a lab setting dr okonkwo explains that the integrity of the data is analysed posttransfer to confirm it was sent as quickly as reported without accumulating too many errors he also adds that the system he and colleagues used relied on multiple cores – a total of 19 cores inside one fibre cable this is a new type of cable unlike the standard ones that connect many people’s home to the internet but older fibre is expensive to dig up and replace extending its lifetime is useful argues wladek forysiak at aston university in the uk he and colleagues have recently achieved speeds of around 402 terabits per second tbps along a 50kmlong optical fibre with just one core that’s about 57 million times faster than the average uk home broadband connection “i think it’s a world best we don’t know of any results that are better than that” says prof forysiak their technique relies on using more wavelengths of light than usual when flashing data down an optical line for this they use alternative forms of the electronic equipment that sends and receives signals over fibre optic cables but such a setup could be easier to install than replacing thousands of kilometres of the cable itself activities in the socalled metaverse might one day require extreme bandwidth suggests martin creaner director general of the world broadband association his organisation expects home broadband connections to reach up to 50 gbps by 2030 but reliability may be even more important than speed for some applications “for remote robotic surgery across 3000 miles… you absolutely do not want any scenario where the network goes down” says mr creaner dr okonkwo adds that training ai will increasingly require moving huge datasets around the faster this can be done the better he argues and ian phillips who works alongside prof forysiak says bandwidth tends to find applications once it is available “humanity finds a way of consuming it” telegeography demand for bandwidth is growing surprisingly fast says lane burdette,,,,,,,,Very Old

what distinguishes taylor swift concerts in the realm of passion tourism is the broad interest and enthusiasm among americans who want to travel abroad according to travel agents ive never seen this excitement to travel to go see an artist said jessica griscavage a travel advisor and founder of runway travel the most recent example that might come close is a spice girls concert in the 1990s she

travel to new places about 159 million americans traveled internationally in the first quarter of 2024 an alltime high according to mastercards travel report consumers are also spending for travel at

bike inside a showroom in new york us on wednesday nov 1 2023 peloton interactive inc is scheduled to release earnings figures on november 2 michael nagle bloomberg getty images peloton no longer faces an imminent liquidity crunch after a massive debt refinancing but the company still has a long road ahead to fix its business and get back to profitability in late may the connected fitness company secured a new 1 billion term loan raised 350 million in convertible senior notes and received a new 100 million line of credit from jp morgan and goldman sachs all of those are due in 2029 the refinance reduced pelotons debt from about 175 billion to around 155 billion and pushed off looming due dates on loans that it likely wouldnt have had the cash to pay back before the refinancing peloton would have needed to pay around 800 million toward its debt by november 2025 if it managed to pay that about another 200 million still would have been due around three months later the term loan would have been due in may 2027 for peloton which hasnt turned a net profit since december 2020 and has seen sales fall for nine straight quarters the debt pile posed an existential threat and fueled investor concerns about a possible bankruptcy now that it has refinanced peloton has eased investor concerns about liquidity and has the breathing room it needs to try to turn around its business the fact that it was able to secure these loans signals investors believe in its ability to rightsize its business and eventually pay them back restructuring experts told cnbc this refinancing is now putting us in a much better position for sustainable profitable growth and just a much stronger financial footing than where we were before and our investors saw that finance chief liz coddington told cnbc in an interview i think they believe in the story they believe in what were trying to do as do we and in the transformation of the business and so it was just a great vote of confidence for pelotons future peloton faces risks ahead while the refinance may have bought peloton some time its far from a panacea under the terms peloton will now be spending about 133 million annually in interest up from around 89 million previously it will make pelotons efforts to sustain positive free cash flow more difficult coddington acknowledged to cnbc that the higher interest expense is going to impact free cash flow but said thats partly why the company started to cut costs in early may the plan is expected to reduce annual runrate expenses by more than 200 million even with the higher interest payments coddington expects the company will be able to sustain positive free cash flow without having the business materially grow in the near term the cost reduction plan made us much more comfortable with that said coddington while peloton insists that investors bought into its refinance because they believe in its strategy some could be trying to put themselves in a better position if the company fails two of pelotons largest debt holders soros fund management and silver point capital are known to sometimes invest in distressed companies since the peloton loans they invested in are secured they are near the top of the capital structure if peloton cant turn its business around and ends up in a position where its considering or filing for bankruptcy its creditors would be in a strong position to take control of the company i would describe this refinancing slash recapitalization as sort of opportunistic said evan dufaux a special situations analyst at creditsights and an expert in distressed debt i think thats just sort of a smart opportunistic and kind of tricky move silver point declined to comment soros didnt return a request for comment more cost cuts to come peloton is in a far better cash position than it was a few months ago but the company still needs to address the demand issues that have plagued it since the covid19 pandemic wound down and figure out what kind of business it will be in the future it really is an exercise in kicking the can down the road because the refinancing itself buys time but it doesnt actually fix any of the underlying problems at peloton said neil saunders managing director of globaldata retail those are very different issues to the refinancing following former ceo barry mccarthys departure and with two board members karen boone and chris bruzzo now in charge peloton needs to decide is it a content company like the netflix for fitness or is it a hardware company that needs to develop new strategies to sell its pricey equipment so far straddling both has proven to be unsuccessful theyre going to have to make some decisions about which parts of the model are survivable which parts are not or things that they can do to advance forward without losing the great brand value that they still currently have especially with the loyal following that they have said scott stuart the ceo of the turnaround management association and an expert in corporate restructurings money doesnt fix everything and the issue becomes the more money you take and the more you refinance the more problematic it becomes he added simeon siegel a retail analyst for bmo capital markets said peloton can start addressing its issues by forgetting about trying to grow the business for now and instead focus on bear hugging its millions of brand loyalists he pointed out that the company makes about 16 billion in recurring highmargin subscription revenue and sees more than 11 billion in gross profit from that side of the business the problem is they lose money how do you lose money if youre generating a billion one of recurring gross profit dollars said siegel well you take all of that gross profit and you spend it to try and chase new growth he said peloton could generate around 500 million in ebitda if it cuts research and development marketing and other corporate expenses for example pelotons marketing budget is around 25 of annual sales and if the company reduces it to even 10 it would still be in the upper echelon of most brands said siegel their debt is scary on a company thats burning cash their debts not scary at all on a company that can make half a billion dollars of ebitda he said they have a business thats generating a tremendous amount of cash they need to stop spending it in may peloton announced it would cut 15 of its corporate workforce but it may be more reluctant to back off its growth strategy peloton founder john foley set a goal of growing to 100 million members and mccarthy adopted the target when he took over as of the end of march peloton had about 66 million members — woefully behind that longterm target since the company announced its cost cutting plan mccarthys departure and another disastrous earnings report in early may peloton has been largely mum on its strategy it said that its searching for a new permanent ceo and the person it hires will offer clues about the companys direction if it hires another hyper growth tech ceo like mccarthy – who had done stints at netflix and spotify – then peloton will likely face the same

A0042,2024-07-02,314,Labour is putting its plans for Britain in the hands of private finance. It could end badly | Daniela Gabor,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/02/labour-plans-britain-private-finance-blackrock,the labour party has a plan for returning to power it will get blackrock to rebuild britain its reasoning is straightforward a cashstrapped government that wants to avoid tax increases or austerity has no choice but to partner with big finance attracting private investment to rebuild the infrastructure that is crumbling after years of tory underinvestment labour has already done the arithmetic to mobilise £3 of private capital from institutional investors you need to offer them £1 in public subsidies but every time you hear labour announce such an infrastructure partnership think of the hidden politics blackrock will privatise britain – our housing education health nature and green energy – with our taxpayer money as sweetener blackrock has long peddled the idea of publicprivate partnerships for infrastructure climate and development yet its political momentum has recently accelerated when its chair larry fink the world’s most powerful financier sat with world leaders at the g7 summit last month he promised the following rich countries need growth infrastructure investment can deliver that growth but public debt is too high for the state alone to invest the estimated 75tn £59tn necessary by 2040 trillions however are available to asset managers who look after our pensions and insurance contributions blackrock the largest of these firms manages about 10tn as a shrinking welfare state pushes us – future pensioners – into its arms if governments work with big finance fink explained they can unlock these trillions but to do so they will need to mint public infrastructure into investable assets that can generate steady returns for investors why does blackrock need the state why can’t it deploy trillions without the government’s helping hand the british public remembers all too well pfis the private finance initiatives through which the state ended up paying extortionate amounts to private contractors that designed built financed or operated public services such as prisons schools and hospitals before handing them back to the state often in poor condition but for big finance there is more now at stake in this golden age of infrastructure financiers plan to own our infrastructure outright and transform it into a source of steady revenue since buying global infrastructure partners in january 2024 blackrock holds about 150bn in infrastructure assets including us renewable energy companies wastewater services in france and airports in england and australia it plans to expand aggressively just like other private infrastructure funds direct ownership is the main game but not the only one big finance can also invest in infrastructure indirectly by lending to private infrastructure companies the key is returns for this blackrock wants the state to “derisk” investments this financial jargon was included in the 2024 labour manifesto and it in essence involves the state stepping in to improve the returns on infrastructure assets the choice here is not merely between public and private financing of public goods but whether british citizens should tolerate the government handing out public subsidies for privatised infrastructure housing is only one example of the areas where these investors can already be glimpsed institutional landlords – the most prominent being blackstone the private equity fund – can acquire residential housing by participating in the privatisation of public housing after the global financial crisis the firm also bought up nonperforming mortgages and since then it has gone on a global shopping spree snapping up homes across the us and europe in the past year blackstone bought new rental homes in britain worth about £14bn from the housebuilding company vistry look behind blackstone’s returns – which come from rents and rising house prices – and you will find the state’s footprint the government has helped to guarantee and derisk these returns through regulations that favour asset owners over renters through economic policies that support house price inflation and through the provision of income support – such as housing benefit – that allows renters to continue paying their institutional landlords although we’re told that partnering with these investors is a means of solving the housing crisis it often delivers the opposite higher rents the displacement of lowerincome tenants who are often from minority groups and less affordable housing this explains the backlash against institutional landlords from copenhagen to berlin dublin and madrid yet such public pressure will only be effective once the state returns to building public housing labour’s strategy raises a bigger set of questions about the type of state we want starmer’s vision for governmentbyblackrock reduces the question of state capacity to “how do i get blackrock to invest in infrastructure assets” this model involves the state in effect subsidising the privatisation of everyday life this doesn’t only make it harder to bring public goods back into public ownership it also allows big finance to tighten the grip on the social contract with citizens and to become the ultimate arbiter of climate energy and welfare politics which will have profound distributional structural and political consequences already blackrock is betting on becoming a key provider of green energy infrastructure – though its actual commitment to tackling the climate crisis only extends so far the firm has lobbied heavily against european proposals to regulate its lending to fossil fuel interests with penalties and has instead called for voluntary climate commitments it is aiming to rapidly grow its green energy profits by tapping the government subsidies that will probably be provided through starmer’s gb energy and through the us inflation reduction act but the profits blackrock will hope to generate through investing in green energy are likely to come at a huge cost in britain we know that the public ownership of green energy is more effective at lowering consumer bills accelerating the green transition and creating good jobs the risk is not only that our climate future will be vastly more expensive if actors such as blackrock are driving it but that this future will also produce a more unequal society where citizens equate green measures with unaffordable public services this may well provide the kindling for authoritarian farright fossilfuel politics that reject the green transition and frame it as an assault on people’s living standards instead we should plan creatively for a future where extreme climate events necessitate permanent state intervention from price controls to buffer stocks and public ownership what’s needed is a big green state for this we first need to repair a serious failure of macroeconomic policy

biden face off in the first debate of the 2024 presidential campaign in atlanta june 27 2024 andrew harnik getty images news getty images the recent us presidential debate saw both candidates trade barbs related to the economy high pandemicera inflation was among the grievances he caused the inflation trump said of biden during the june 27 debate i gave him a country with no essentially no inflation he added biden countered by saying inflation was low during trumps term because the economy was flat on its back he decimated the economy absolutely decimated the economy biden said watch now but the cause of inflation isnt so blackandwhite economists say in fact biden and trump are not responsible for much of the inflation consumers have experienced in recent years they said neither trump nor biden is to blame global events beyond trumps or bidens control wreaked havoc on supplyanddemand dynamics in the us economy fueling higher prices economists said there were other factors too the federal reserve which acts independently from the oval office was slow to act to contain hot inflation for example some biden and trump policies such as pandemic relief packages also likely played a role as might have socalled greedflation i dont think its a simple yesno kind of answer said david wessel director of the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at the brookings institution a leftleaning think tank in general presidents get more credit and blame for the economy than they deserve he said more from personal finance trump may roll back student loan forgiveness programs if elected what a supreme court ruling could mean for bidens billionaire tax biden trump accuse each other of ruining social security medicare that biden is seen as stoking high inflation is due somewhat to optics he took office in early 2021 around the time inflation spiked notably economists said likewise the covid19 pandemic plunged the us into a severe recession during trumps tenure pulling the consumer price index to near zero in spring 2020 as unemployment ballooned and consumers cut spending in my view neither trump nor biden is to blame for the high inflation said mark zandi chief economist at moodys analytics the blame goes to the pandemic and the russian war in ukraine the big reasons inflation spiked inflation has many tentacles at a high level hot inflation is largely an issue of mismatched supply and demand the pandemic upended the typical dynamics for one it disrupted global supply chains there were labor shortages illness sidelined workers childcare centers closed making it hard for parents to work others were worried about getting sick on the job a decline in immigration also reduced worker supply economists said china shut down factories and cargo ships couldnt be unloaded at ports for example reducing the supply of goods meanwhile consumers changed their buying patterns they bought more physical stuff such as living room furniture and desks for their home offices as they spent more time indoors — a departure from prepandemic norms when americans tended to spend more money on services such as dining out travel and going to movies and concerts cargo containers sit stacked on ships at the port of los angeles the nation’s busiest container port in san pedro california on oct 15 2021 mario tama getty images news getty images high demand which boomed when the us economy reopened broadly coupled with goods shortages fueled higher prices there were other related factors too for example automakers didnt have enough semiconductor chips necessary to build cars while rental car companies sold off their fleets because they didnt think the recession would be shortlived making it pricier to rent when the economy rebounded quickly wessel said as covid cases were hitting record highs heading into 2022 further disrupting supply chains russias war in ukraine supercharged inflation by stoking higher prices for commodities such as oil and food around the world zandi said as a result global inflation hit a level higher than seen in several decades the international monetary fund wrote in october 2022 we only have to look at the still high inflation rates in most other advanced economies to see that most of this inflation period was really about global trends rather than about the specific policy actions of any given government though they did of course play some role stephen brown deputy chief north america economist for capital economics wrote in an email big spending bills impact only clear in hindsight however biden and trump arent entirely without fault they greenlit additional government spending in the pandemic era that contributed to inflation for example economists said for example the american rescue plan — the 19 trillion stimulus package biden signed in march 2021— offered 1400 stimulus checks enhanced unemployment benefits and a larger child tax credit to households in addition to other relief the policy led to some good things such as a strong job market and low unemployment said michael strain director of economic policy studies at the american enterprise institute a rightleaning think tank but its magnitude was greater than the us economy needed at the time serving to raise prices by putting more money in consumers pockets which fueled demand he said i do think president biden bears some responsibility for the inflation that weve been living through for the past few years strain said he estimated the american rescue plan added about 2 percentage points to underlying inflation the consumer price index peaked around 9 in june 2022 the highest since 1981 its since declined to 33 as of may 2024 the federal reserve — the us central bank — aims for a longterm inflation rate near 2 i think if it werent for the american rescue plan the us still would have had inflation strain added so i think its important not to overstate the situation however zandi viewed the arps inflationary impact as good and desirable bringing the economy back to the feds longterm target inflation rate after a prolonged period of belowaverage inflation trump had also authorized two stimulus packages in march and december 2020 worth about 3 trillion these socalled fiscal policy responses were insurance against a lousy economic recovery perhaps overshooting after the us lackluster response to the great recession that mired the nation in high unemployment for years wessel said that the us issued perhaps too much stimulus was the presidents fault but only clear in hindsight he said biden and trump also enacted other policies that may contribute to higher prices economists said for example trump imposed tariffs on imported steel aluminum and several goods from china which biden largely kept intact biden also set new import taxes on chinese goods such as electric vehicles and solar panels the fed and greedflation,,,,,,,,Very Old

minerals and exploration picture alliance picture alliance getty images beijing — china dominates the supply chain for many of the worlds critical minerals but so far its held off on sweeping restrictions on at least one tungsten the metal is nearly as hard as diamond and has a high energy density thats made tungsten an important material in weapons autos electric car batteries semiconductors and industrial cutting machines chipmakers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company and nvidia both use the metal i dont expect any saberrattling over tungsten said lewis black ceo of canadabased almonty industries which is spending at least 75 million to reopen a tungsten mine in south korea later this year if you get too belligerent about diversification it becomes a situation thats biting the hand that feeds you he said adding that tungsten has always been a diplomatic metal while the biden administration raised tariffs on imports of tungsten in may china this past weekend did not include the metal in new regulations for boosting its oversight of domestic rare earths production but china might not be too concerned because the chinese government ignored the new tariffs they completely ignored it because the chinese dont want tensions to rise lewis black ceo of almonty the tariffs were more of a warning shot as biden only put tariffs on three of the 25 strategic metals china exports black said but china might not be too concerned because the chinese government ignored the new tariffs unlike in the past when they restricted some exports of rare earths they completely ignored it because the chinese dont want tensions to rise asked last month if china would retaliate to the latest us tariffs on tungsten chinas ministry of commerce spokesperson he yadong didnt announce countermeasures instead he called on the us to remove the additional duties commodity price reporting and analytics company fastmarkets pointed out earlier this year that

diversify away from china almonty claims the forthcoming mine in south korea has the potential to produce 50 of the worlds exchina tungsten supply demand for nonchinese tungsten is already on the rise

between the united states and the chinese communist party last month announced a new working group on the us critical minerals policy soaring tungsten prices expectations for higher demand and limited supplies of tungsten have pushed prices to multiyear highs although they have tapered off in the last several weeks dornhofer said in an interview in late may that he was also seeing chinese buyers

are willing to pay he said definitely going to be a game changer watch now back in january usbased research firm macro ops said were approaching an inflection point in tungsten supply the us will

cnbc request for comment on this story brandon beylo head of investment research at macro ops told cnbc in an email there are only six companies in the us with capacity to produce tungsten he added

accounts,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/synapse-fintech-fdic-false-promise.html,watch now when natasha craft first got a yotta banking account in 2021 she loved using it so much she told her friends to sign up the app made saving money fun and easy and craft a now 25yearold fedex driver from mishawaka indiana was busy getting her financial life in order and planning a wedding craft had her wages deposited directly into a yotta account and used the startups debit card to pay for all her expenses the app — which gamifies personal finance with weekly sweepstakes and other flashy features — even occasionally covered some of her transactions there were times i would go buy something and get that purchase for free craft told cnbc today her entire life savings — 7006 — is locked up in a complicated dispute playing out in bankruptcy court online forums like reddit and regulatory channels and yotta an array of other startups and their banks have been caught in a moment of reckoning for the fintech industry for customers fintech promised the best of both worlds the innovation ease of use and fun of the newest apps combined with the safety of governmentbacked accounts held at real banks the startups prominently displayed protections afforded by the federal deposit insurance corp lending credibility to their novel offerings after all since its 1934 inception no depositor has ever lost a penny of fdicinsured deposits according to the agencys website but the widening fallout over the collapse of a fintech middleman called synapse has revealed that promise of safety as a mirage starting may 11 more than 100000 americans with 265 million in deposits were locked out of their accounts roughly 85000 of those customers were at yotta alone according to the startups cofounder adam moelis cnbc reached out to fintech customers whose lives have been upended by the synapse debacle they come from all walks and stages of life from craft the indiana fedex driver to the owner of a chain of preschools in oakland california a talent analyst for disney living in new york city and a computer engineer in santa barbara california a high school teacher in maryland a parent in bristol connecticut who opened an account for his daughter a social worker in seattle saving up for dental work after adderall abuse ruined her teeth a reckoning underway since yotta like most popular fintech apps wasnt itself a bank it relied on partner institutions including tennesseebased evolve bank trust to offer checking accounts and debit cards in between yotta and evolve was a crucial middleman synapse keeping track of balances and monitoring fraud founded in 2014 by a firsttime entrepreneur named sankaet pathak synapse was a player in the bankingasaservice segment alongside companies like unit and synctera synapse helped customerfacing startups like yotta quickly access the rails of the regulated banking industry it had contracts with 100 fintech companies and 10 million end users according to an april court filing until recently the baas model was a growth engine that seemed to benefit everybody instead of spending years and millions of dollars trying to acquire or become banks startups got quick access to essential services they needed to offer the small banks that catered to them got a source of deposits in a time dominated by giants like jpmorgan chase but in may synapse in the throes of bankruptcy turned off a critical system that yottas bank used to process transactions in doing so it threw thousands of americans into financial limbo and a growing segment of the fintech industry into turmoil there is a reckoning underway that involves questions about the bankingasaservice model said michele alt a former lawyer for the office of the comptroller of the currency and a current partner at consulting firm klaros group she believes the synapse failure will prove to be an aberration she added the most popular finance apps in the country including blocks cash app paypal and chime partner with banks instead of owning them they account for 60 of all new fintech account openings according to data provider curinos block and paypal are publicly traded chime is expected to launch an ipo next year block paypal and chime didnt provide comment for this article deal directly with a bank while industry experts say those firms have far more robust ledgering and daily reconciliation abilities than synapse they may still be riskier than direct bank relationships especially for those relying on them as a primary account if its your spending money you need to be dealing directly with a bank scott sanborn ceo of lendingclub told cnbc otherwise how do you as a consumer know if the conditions are met to get fdic coverage sanborn knows both sides of the fintech divide lendingclub started as a fintech lender that partnered with banks until it bought bostonbased radius in early 2020 for 185 million eventually becoming a fully regulated bank scott sanborn lendingclub ceo getty images sanborn said acquiring radius bank opened his eyes to the risks of the bankingasaservice space regulators focus not on synapse and other middlemen but on the banks they partner with expecting them to monitor risks and prevent fraud and money laundering he said but many of the tiny banks running baas businesses like radius simply dont have the personnel or resources to do the job properly sanborn said he shuttered most of the lenders fintech business as soon as he could he says we are one of those people who said something bad is going to happen sanborn said a spokeswoman for the financial technology association a washington dcbased trade group representing large players including block paypal and chime said in a statement that it is inaccurate to claim that banks are the only trusted actors in financial services consumers and small businesses trust fintech companies to better meet their needs and provide more accessible affordable and secure services than incumbent providers the spokeswoman said established fintech companies are wellregulated and work with partner banks to build strong compliance programs that protect consumer funds she said furthermore regulators ought to take a riskbased approach to supervising fintechbank partnerships she added the implications of the synapse disaster may be farreaching regulators have already been moving to punish the banks that provide services to fintechs and that will undoubtedly continue evolve itself was reprimanded by the federal reserve last month for failing to properly manage its fintech partnerships in a postsynapse update the fdic made it clear that the failure of nonbanks wont trigger fdic insurance and that even when fintechs partner with banks customers may not have their deposits covered the fdics exact language about whether fintech customers are eligible for coverage the short answer is it depends fdic safety net while their circumstances all differed vastly each of the customers cnbc spoke to for this story had one thing in common they thought the fdic backing of evolve meant that their funds were safe for us it just felt like they were a bank the oakland preschool owner said of her fintech provider a tuition processor called curacubby youd tell them what to bill they bill it theyd communicate with parents and we get the money the 62yearold business owner who asked cnbc to withhold her name because she didnt want to alarm employees and parents of her schools said shes taken out loans and tapped credit lines after 236287 in tuition was frozen in may now the prospect of selling her business and retiring in a few years seems much further out im assuming i probably wont see that money she said and if i do how long is it going to take when rick davies a 46yearold lead engineer for a mens clothing company that owns online brands including taylor stitch signed up for an account with crypto app juno he says he distinctly remembers being comforted by seeing the fdic logo of evolve it was front and center on their website davies said they made it clear that it was evolve doing the banking which i knew as a fintech provider the whole package seemed legit to me hes now had roughly 10000 frozen for weeks and says hes become enraged that the fdic hasnt helped customers yet for davies the situation is even more baffling after regulators swiftly took action to seize silicon valley bank last year protecting uninsured depositors including tech investors and wealthy families in the process his employer banked with svb which collapsed after clients withdrew deposits en masse so he saw how fast action by regulators can head off distress the dichotomy between the fdic stepping in extremely quickly for san franciscobased tech companies and their impotence in the face of this similar more consumeroriented situation is infuriating davies said the key difference with svb is that none of the banks linked with synapse have failed and because of that the regulator hasnt moved to help impacted users consumers can be forgiven for not understanding the nuance of fdic protection said alt the former occ lawyer what consumers understood was this is as safe as money in the bank alt said but the fdic insurance isnt a pot of money to generally make people whole it is there to make depositors of a failed bank whole waiting for their money for the customers involved in the synapse mess the worstcase scenario is playing out while some customers have had funds released in recent weeks most are still waiting those later in line may never see a full payout there is a shortfall of up to 96 million in funds that are owed to customers according to the courtappointed bankruptcy trustee thats because of synapses shoddy ledgers and its system of pooling users money across a network of banks in ways that make it difficult to reconstruct who is owed what according to court filings the situation is so tangled that jelena mcwilliams a former fdic chairman now acting as trustee over the synapse bankruptcy has said that finding all the customer money may be impossible despite weeks of work there appears to be little progress toward fixing the hardest part of the synapse mess users whose funds were pooled in for benefit of or fbo accounts the technique has been used by brokerages for decades to give wealth management customers fdic coverage on their cash but its use in fintech is more novel if its in an fbo account you dont even know who the end customer is you just have this giant account said lendingclubs sanborn youre trusting the fintech to do the work while mcwilliams has floated a partial payment to end users weeks ago an idea that has support from yotta cofounder moelis and others that hasnt happened yet getting consensus from the banks has proven difficult and the bankruptcy judge has openly mused about which regulator or body of government can force them to

on an american military base in south korea thenarmy staff sergeant dave yeager sat down at a slot machine operated by the defense department and made what he now calls the biggest mistake a budding problem gambler can make he won all that stress all that tension all the things that i was carrying with me in that moment went away yeager told cnbc what was supposed to be entertainment a way for servicemembers to relax instead for yeager grew into a disorder that would cost him his career his financial security and his family it went from i was have fun doing this to i have to do this it became an obsession for me he said in his book fall in a veteran with a gambling addiction yeager wrote about how he borrowed from subordinates stole from petty cash and left his family in a lurch financially such vulnerability in a servicemember affects individual readiness and potentially even national security if enemies were to exploit it he pointed out dave yeager got hooked on slot machines when he was deployed to south korea today he counsels others about gambling disorder cnbc yet when yeager said he confessed of that vulnerability to his commanders and his counselors no one pointed the finger at his gambling or helped him to help himself the chaplain told me to go to bingo night on sunday that would give me something to do yeager said and im like i think youre missing the point here as of 2017 the department of defense operated more than 3100 slot machines on us military installations in a dozen foreign countries according to a report from the government accountability office the machines produce more than 100 million annually in revenue and is seen as a morale booster for the welfare and recreation for servicemembers akin to activities like golf libraries and other entertainment overseas servicemembers as young as 18 may be permitted to gamble domestically slot machines are prohibited on military bases though casinos are frequently located nearby there are seven local casinos located within 20 minutes from joint base lewismcchord in washington state one of the countrys largest military installations in 2018 when a supreme court decision paved the way for states to legalize sports betting the opportunities for wagering exploded now more broadly all but four states permit gambling in some form all of a sudden we started to see a lot of people with gambling problems calling and asking for some help usually within a year or two from the time that it expanded said heather chapman a clinical psychologist and director of the national gambling treatment program for the department of veterans affairs diagnoses of pathological gambling disorders among servicemembers and veterans is soaring with more patients receiving a diagnosis in the first half of 2024 as in all of 2022 according to va research twenty percent of those referrals are women its not terribly surprising because with accessibility and availability increases we tend to see a rise in unhealthy engagement said dominick dephilippis deputy national mental health director for substance abuse disorders for the va servicemembers are more vulnerable than civilians to gambling disorders and may be hesitant to selfreport fearing they could lose their security clearance or to avoid the stigma attached to gambling problems the va research found studies have found the prevalence of problem gambling and gambling disorder among veterans to be as high as 107 in some parts of the us the department said though those studies have been smaller and typically regional which leads to a wide variance among results to address the growing concern the va operates two residential treatment facilities for gambling addiction and has a myriad partnerships with civilian facilities throughout the country chapman said we are sort of the mecca of gambling treatment she said the va began treating gambling disorders in the late 1960s about nine years after congress banned slot machines from domestic bases the department of defense declined cnbcs request for an interview but said in a statement there hasnt been any systemwide increases in resources to address problem gambling it said a health related behavior survey from 2018 — before the boom in sports betting — indicated that rates of problem gambling among servicemembers of 16 to 17 was in line with the incidence in the civilian population dod researchers are aware of changes in gambling availability due to new mobile and sports gambling options and will consider these variables in future military

strength in its beer business however shares fell 4 after an initial move up as investors — including us — remain troubled by continued weakness in the wines and spirits business comparable net sales for the three months ended may 31 increased 6 year over year to 2662 billion missing wall streets expectations of 2671 billion according to lseg adjusted earningspershare eps increased 17 compared with the same period last year to 357 a beat versus the 346 per share predicted by analysts constellation brands why we own it we like constellation brands for its beer franchise which includes popular mexican brands modelo corona and pacifico we would like constellation to concentrate on beer and divest its wine and spirits business competitors anheuserbusch inbev and molson coors weight in club portfolio 25 most recent buy april 16 2024 initiated may 5 2022 bottom line this quarter reaffirmed our belief that constellation has a great beer business that is weighed down by its wineandspirits unit while overall sales came up short ceo bill newlands said it still beat the overall consumer packaged goods growth by 45 percentage points that outperformance was largely driven by the growth of its beer business which attained the second largest share gain in the entire beverage industry and the top share gain in alcoholic beverages we were again pleased to see that the increase in beer sales was driven by strong growth in shipment volume remember the ability to grow sales via increased volume is crucial given the inflationary dynamics weve had to deal with coming out of covid thats because consumers are starting to push back on high prices the ability to grow sales via increased volumes alleviates some pressure on management to take action on prices a key factor that should help the company continue gaining market share operating cash flow came in light but free cash flow was largely in line with expectations as members know cash flow is the key to shareholder returns and indeed management paid out 185 million in dividends during the quarter while repurchasing 200 million worth of shares and repurchased another 40 million worth of shares in june the team continues to target a net leverage ratio of 3 times by the end of the fiscal year management said it is working to right the wineandspirits business and expects to see improvements in the back half of the year as operational and commercial execution initiatives identified in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year and started in the first quarter of this year take hold guidance is in line with the expectation that weakness in the business is bottoming out we maintain the view that a rebound or divestiture of the wineandspirits segment remains key to the stock reaching new highs while we are sticking with the name given the strength in beer we opted to trim our position and downgrade the stock to a 2 rating we want to see actual progress before getting more positive on the trajectory of the stock from here we are keeping our price target of 300 quarterly results constellations wineandspirits division remains a drag with net sales falling 7 to 389 million slightly below street estimates while operating income dropped 25 to around 60 million operating margin for the segment was down 370 basis points to 153 worse than expectations the weakness is attributable to lower volumes and higher costs of goods sold which more than offset the benefits of lower operating expenses elsewhere shipment volumes declined 51 due to challenging market conditions primarily in the us wholesale channel depletions a key metric that represents how much was product was sold to retailers by a distributor were down 127 from a year ago the tactical investments in the 11 brands that represent 75 of net sales and over 80 of volumes for our wine and spirits business in fiscal 24 are now underway and we expect to see improvements in this select group of our most scaled offerings over the remainder of the year the company said during its postearnings call with investors beer segment results on the other hand remain largely positive though sales did come in a bit light versus estimates the result still amounts to 8 yearoveryear growth moreover strong profitability led to a beat on operating income despite the topline miss operating margin expansion resulted from greater operating leverage fixed costs were more spread out along with benefits from ongoing costsaving initiatives and timing and efficiencies in marketing investments shipments increased 76 year over year

pledged to god can save a world or lose it washington – covenants are viewed as the most sacred and binding of deals – an oath thats never to be broken americas earliest settlers made a covenant with god to serve and proclaim him throughout the earth these days however americans appear to have forgotten this covenant and that can have dire consequences christian leader dutch sheets explained to cbn news how gods relationship with us is set by a sacred covenant this author of giants will fall said its even what he based our salvation on im coming to bring a new covenant through jesus the shedding of his blood ratifies this covenant it is a binding together that in him is unbreakable america began in covenant early english settlers also wanted their new land to share such a binding covenant with god christian historian eddie hyatt the author of the great prayer awakening of 185758 said those who came to jamestown starting in 1607 put it in their virginia compact to propagate to expand the gospel the kingdom of the lord jesus christ and to take the gospel to people who were lying in darkness and had no knowledge of the one true god they said that was the reason they had come hyatt stated the pilgrims arriving in massachusetts stated the same in 1620 jerry newcombe the author of the book that made america paraphrased what they wrote down having undertaken a voyage for the glory of god and the advancement of the christian faith newcombe explained of the pilgrims and puritans who followed they came for god as opposed to coming for gold hyatt says john winthrop leading 700 puritans to massachusetts in 1631 said it like this others may come to the new world for wealth and furs he said we have another goal another end we have entered into an explicit covenant with god to be his people in this new world and they wanted to be that city on a hill they wanted to be a model of christianity for the rest of the world to see david barton of wallbuilders said as these early settlers wrote out their covenants they were very cognizant of the fact that we answer to god we need to get god at the center of what we do if we do hell bless us if we dont were in trouble these covenants became models for the us constitution these early covenants pledged the signers to each other and to obeying the laws theyd form with gods guidance as newcombe put it this was something that would bind each man and each person to the whole community as an agreement under god according to historian william federer such compacts became the model for the us constitution whose authors were also very much guided by their christian faith the writer of the online americanminutecom stated george washington at the beginning of the constitutional convention he said the event is in the hand of god how has americas constitution lasted so long they saw the constitution as being a very religiouslybased document said barton it was also a very covenantalbased document we made a covenant the constitution is a covenant of these states he went on the average length of a constitution in the history of the world was 17 years so how have we gone 230 when everybody else was going 17 and so political science professors looked to see where the founders got their ideas barton pointed out they studied 3154 direct quotes from these founders political writings and discovered how much gods word figured in them he summed up the number one source was the bible 34 percent of all those quotes in those political documents etc came out of the bible sheets explains in his book giants will fall that the makeup of the government was shaped by biblical passages like isaiah 3322 writing our nations form of government was actually taken from scripture the lord is our judge judicial branch…lawgiver legislative branch…and king executive branch the founders put god first and foremost in the declaration of independence federer stated it says right in there appealing to the supreme judge of the world in this founding document we appealed to god we invited him to be a part of this american experiment the founders put scripture on the liberty bell leviticus 2510 proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof… the concept of this being one nation under god harkens back to jesus telling jerusalem in luke 1334 that he wanted to …hide you under my wings covering and protecting you dire consequences of deserting covenant what happens though as parts of the nation dont want to be under god disregard parts of the constitution and no longer honor sacred oaths sheets warned we have walked away from covenant with him and even from the marriage covenant with the divorce rate soaring 302 percent in the 20th century newcombe argued a lot of the things that were experiencing in america today are because weve disregarded gods covenant america once the number one exporter of the gospel is now the number one importer of illegal drugs and the number one exporter of pornography newcombe explained god warned about this saying obey me then i will bless you but if you disobey me i will remove my blessing so much is on the line if america really is to be the place from which the gospel is spread to the whole world then the salvation of billions hangs in the balance sheets believes theres hope but only if americans return to honoring their covenant with god because that makes us his family sheets gave an example saying if the kids across the street i dont know if they do something evil or wrong i feel no responsibility to try to bring them back into the fold because im not in covenant with them im not in that relationship god is the same way barton pointed out the longsuffering faithfulness of the lord saying were told in psalm 105 he keeps his covenant for a thousand generations sheets added i dont think theres a stronger force in the world so theres a chance the nation can still someday completely fulfill the prophecy of destiny jamestown chaplain robert hunt said in 1607 as he came ashore in virginia just a few miles from where the christian broadcasting network’s headquarters are located hyatt explained he made this declaration which i believe was prophetic he said from these very shores the gospel shall go forth not only to this new world but to all the world and that was just not very far from cbn it just takes getting back to covenant as joel 213 says now return to the lord your god for he is gracious and compassionate slow to anger abounding in lovingkindness,,,,,,,,Very Old

Government",CBN,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2020/july/the-founders-meant-to-keep-government-out-of-the-church-not-god-out-of-the-government,the founders meant to keep government out of the church not god out of the government the 4th of july makes us think of our independence and freedoms and recent legal battles over religious liberty in the usa raise serious questions about the freedom to worship in america so when our founders came up with the first amendment were they trying to keep the government free from religion or religion free from government these days the phrase wall of separation between church and state has come to mean keeping god or his believers from having a big effect on government and public life but that’s far far from what the founding fathers were thinking of when they were separating church and state fear of an allpowerful state church wed to the power of the government they were afraid of what so many of the old world countries had a religion established by the state as its one true religion that would tyrannically rule over the faith and conscience of every citizen as the providence forum’s peter lillback put it “they recognized having a monolithic church was a dangerous thing” thats because it made the king not only their physical sovereign but also their allpowerful spiritual ruler before the pilgrims fled england wallbuilders david barton recalled “the pilgrims’ pastor was executed because he made the statement that jesus christ is head of the church and the monarch said ‘oh no i’m the head of the church you’re dead’” wouldnt allow a church of america like the brits had the church of england knowing of such terror and tyranny americanminutecom historian william federer explained how the founders felt their big fear was the federal government was going to follow the blueprint of every country in europe and pick one national denomination so what they meant by saying in the first amendment congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion was that the federal government was banned from creating – or establishing – a national religion with the national government wedded to it they didnt want to have a national established church of america like you have the church of england forcing people to believe something that they didnt believe in said jerry newcombe host of the radio program vocal point “what they said was we dont want a state church here consciously therefore they were separating the church from government lillback said but that was strictly to protect the churches and each believer’s faith and conscience from the government all about protecting each americans conscience and freedom to believe not only did the first amendment say congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion but it also said or prohibiting the free exercise thereof what they wanted was the freedom that we have in the bible the rights of conscience barton said and they didnt want the state telling us how we could or couldnt practice our faith lillback said the founders keeping government control away from faith meant each of us has a right to be who we are before god it has been well said and its a classic statement of religious liberty that man is not free unless he is free on the inside we have to have the freedom to believe what we believe thats what the first amendment protects please sign up for cbn newsletters and download the cbn news app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly christian perspective god hes on both sides of the wall and that’s what christian historian eddie hyatt explained thomas jefferson was talking about when he wrote the letter that first used the famous wall of separation phrase to a group of worried baptists he said that the first amendment had erected a wall of separation that would protect them from any intrusion of the government hyatt stated in jeffersons mind the wall of separation was a unidirectional wall put there to keep the government out of the church not to keep the influence of the church out of the government there was no antipathy towards the lord in all of this lillback insisted saying “but the idea of god he’s on both sides of the wall and he’s welcome there and he should be” the government is reaching over that wall bossing around people of faith but today theres been a complete flip lillback said “those who once believed in this really high and impregnable wall of church and state we now see the government reaching over that wall and saying ‘but don’t preach that text of scripture’” stay up to date with the free cbn news app click here get the app with special alerts on breaking news and top stories barton added “all of a sudden the government’s regulating religious activities which is what jefferson said they would not do because of separation of church and state” hyatt lamented “the founders would be so distressed to see how that statement has been turned on its head” as newcombe explained they absolutely did not mean the separation of god and government which is whats often being practiced today no one under government but each one under god lillback encourages americans to remember what the nations founders intended “this is a theistic government so god was not separated from government he insisted so any interpretation of the first amendment that takes god out of government is turning the whole story on its head rather it was taking a formal state church out of the equation leaving it up to each individual but all as we still say under god that was the view of our founders they believed a nation based on liberty could only stay free if its citizens were godly people as barton pointed out believers in god have their eyes on eternity and it makes them practice selfcontrol knowing youll answer to god makes you govern yourself when you’re godconscious you realize ‘ya know i’m going to have to answer to him for what i do’ and it limits my bad behavior barton stated newcombe added “that’s something the founders believed very strongly that we’re going to be accountable before god” hyatt said of those founders they knew that they were creating a nation for a free people but also for a virtuous people who would govern themselves from within you need very little police power if people because of conscience will police themselves green bean control laws selfcontrol is what you need barton explained we can pass all the control laws we want but unless you control the heart youll never control behavior i mean i can kill somebody with a can of green beans what are we going to do pass green bean control laws if somebody does that no its on the inside and the founders knew to keep america true and free they also needed the perfect law of a loving allwise god as lillback put it “there was a clear understanding that the government needed to have an ultimate check and balance even beyond the people that ran it and their elections and that is the transcendent law of god and so that is why when we look at our declaration of independence there are four references to deity” going through the declaration lillback laid them out were endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights the laws of god and nature and it tells us theres an appeal to the supreme judge of the world and finally a dependence on the providence of god four references to deity not godless at all but then came the us constitution which some say is a godless document because god isn’t mentioned in it as soon as they were done with it though the founders called for a day of thanksgiving to god they were not thinking lets get rid of god lillback stated they said we have been given now a new constitution and now amendments that give us our freedoms and where do we turn we turn to heaven and thank god for this now if their intent was to get rid of god from government boy did they miss their point lillback said because they turned around and thanked him for everything that they had it shows the utter historical absurdity of the godless constitution constitutions last words reference christ and god isn’t really absent from the constitution or its authors’ lives “they are not godless lillback insisted they are people who at the very end of their work said ‘in the year of our lord 1787’ the very last words in the constitution are a reference to jesus christ” he concluded “it’s no surprise then that the ultimate motto is we are one nation under god” this story was originally published in july

nonetheless the worst performing of the seven sectors in contrast the healthcare sector returned to growth in june as output rose for the first time since march moreover the rate of expansion in business activity was solid and the sharpest so far this year the consumer goods and consumer services sectors saw differing trends during june as growth in the latter accelerated to the fastest for

remains elevated by recent standards and supportive of businesses investing in expansion some of this optimism relates to ongoing convictions that interest rates will start to fall before the end of

of kisunla will provide further confidence in this type of treatments which could help drive the uptake of both drugs many of the challenges faced by leqembi will also apply to kisunla both drugs require brain scans before treatment a positron emission tomography pet scan to assess levels of amyloid in the brain and a magnetic resonance imaging mri scan with further mri scans recommended prior to further drug infusions she said access to these scans is a “key limiting factor for the uptake of these drugs” view image in fullscreen the food and drug administration approved eli lilly’s kisunla

compared with 26500 per year for leqembi lilly states that in the long term kisunla will be cheaper and more convenient for patients since they won’t have to take the drug indefinitely something that was included in the fda label which states that once amyloid plaques have been reduced to minimal levels on pet imaging stopping treatment can be considered while there are clear advantages in not having to take a drug indefinitely many questions have been raised about what happens once donanemab therapy is stopped further realworld evidence and clinical trial data will be key for physicians to

human one 3 days ago by marylou costa business reporter share hannu rauma hannu rauma says that using ai to help him manage has added years to my life with the stress of managing 83 employees taking its toll hannu rauma was feeling discouraged and frustrated “i was getting too bogged down in all these things that were going wrong amongst the teams and feeling this disappointment” says mr rauma who is based in vancouver canada he is a senior manager at a company called student marketing agency which employs university students to provide marketing support for small businesses “when i was bringing new clients on board half of my mind would be saying ‘were going to screw up’ and it would dampen my enthusiasm” but mr rauma says that all changed from last november when the firm began using an autonomous ai manager developed by usbased company inspira the ai manager helps the agency’s employees who work flexible hours remotely to set their schedules and plan their workloads in advance it checks their timekeeping sends them deadline reminders and regular checkin messages and records the time spent on different clients so the latter can be billed accurately the ai also makes suggestions to improve the wording of written text is available to answer workrelated questions and automatically updates everyone’s work progress in a central portal mr rauma says that the shift towards an ai manager has not only reduced his stress levels but has enabled his employees to work faster and be more productive “im able to focus on the growth of the company and all the positive things its added years to my life im sure” he says mr rauma adds that his relationships with his employees have also improved drastically “before it felt a lot like a fatherchild situation now were more on an equal footing before it was only about solving problems but now we’re able to have more lighthearted discussions” but not everyone at student marketing agency is using the ai manager yet mr rauma and 26 of his 83 employees were actually part of a study run by inspira and academics from columbia university arizona state university and the university of wisconsin to compare the performance of the ai manager with its human counterparts participants were divided into three groups one coached by a human manager another by the ai manager and the last group by both ai and human manager the ai manager achieved a 44 success rate in getting employees to preplan their workdays in advance and was able to motivate the employees to log in on time 42 of the time these figures were comparable to the human manager who achieved scores of 45 and 44 for those two areas yet when the ai manager worked in partnership with a human manager together they achieved a 72 success rate in getting employees to preplan their workdays and managed to achieve 46 ontime success despite the study being statistically small and concentrated on a specific type of worker and field its results point to interesting implications for companies introducing ai tools getty images dell is one firm that has cut jobs in the face of the rise of ai while businesses like ups dell and others have announced significant job cuts this year with the intention of replacing many roles with ai prof paul thurman from columbia university in new york argues that swapping management roles completely for ai would be a mistake “the middle management layer is the most critical layer in any organisation” says the professor of management “theyre the layer that if it starts turning over youre in for a wild ride your people dont see continuity they dont get mentoring and coaching… all the human things that human managers are better at than ai and should be focusing on” ai prof thurman adds can liberate managers from endless reminding and checking in to focus on more innovative ways of working for example managers can cherry pick project teams based on individual skillsets oversee the brief then hand over to their ai to

tina rahman founder of londonbased hr consultancy hr habitat “we did a study which looked at the reasons people leave a job almost 100 of the respondents said it was because of bad management “some of

that an ai manager would be built to give those correct instructions to give complete transparency on the requirements and the outcomes people are likely to be more productive when they know whats expected of them” but an overreliance on ai management sets the tone that companies only care about output and not people ms rahman warns “it’s going to be very hard for a business to tell their

A0113,2024-07-03,313,De-Dollarization: A Far-Fetched Reality?,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dedollarization-a-farfetched-reality-200649719,in recent years the financial world has increasingly been marked by discussions surrounding dedollarization this term denotes the strategic efforts by various nations to diminish their reliance on the us dollar for international trade and financial transactions with rising geopolitical tensions and the emergence of alternative economic blocs understanding the implications and realities of dedollarization is paramount for professional traders and investors this article explores the rise of dedollarization its impacts on currency and commodity markets and potential future scenarios drivers of dedollarization although it is not new dedollarization has gained momentum due to several geopolitical and economic factors historically the us dollars dominance started with the bretton woods agreement in 1944 which established the dollar as the primary reserve currency of the world backed by gold despite the system collapsing in the early 1970s the dollar kept its dominance because of the stability and size of the us economy its geopolitical influence and the extensive market for us debt one of the primary motivations behind dedollarization is the geopolitical leverage that the united states wields through its control of the global financial system the us has frequently used economic sanctions as a tool of foreign policy targeting countries like russia iran and venezuela these sanctions are facilitated by the dollar’s dominance in international finance which forces targeted nations to seek ways to minimize their exposure to the us financial system the freezing of russias foreign exchange reserves valued at approximately 300 billion following its invasion of ukraine further underscores the risks associated with dollar dependence emerging economies and regional powers are exploring ways to strengthen their currencies and financial systems the brics nations which include brazil russia india china and south africa have been discussing a new reserve currency to reduce their reliance on the dollar in july 2023 bolivia joined brazil and argentina in using the chinese to pay for imports and exports additionally by march 2024 529 of chinas international settlements were conducted in renminbi a significant increase from less than 1 in 2010 brazil and argentina are at the forefront of dedollarization in latin america they are discussing the creation of a common currency for bilateral trade to reduce reliance on the us dollar brazils trade with other brics nations increased dramatically from 48 billion in 2009 to 178 billion in 2022 showing a 370 growth in southeast asia asean countries are making significant strides towards dedollarization indonesia malaysia singapore the philippines and thailand have agreed to develop a crossborder digital payment system to facilitate local currency trade as of 2024 indonesian president joko widodo has urged using locally issued credit cards to avoid foreign payment systems furthering efforts to protect against geopolitical disruptions​​ malaysia is advancing its dedollarization agenda by proposing the creation of an asian monetary fund in 2024 malaysias central bank is developing mechanisms to enable trade with china using the malaysian ringgit instead of the us dollar several african nations including egypt ethiopia and south africa actively engage in dedollarization through their involvement with the brics bloc the brics new development bank ndb is issuing loans in local currencies to help member nations avoid the risks associated with dollardenominated financing as of 2024 the brics countries collectively account for around 24 of the global gdp and 16 of global trade the ndb aims to provide 30 of its loans in local currencies promoting economic stability among developing nations​​​​ another example of a gradual shift towards regional currencies in bilateral trade is the recent agreement between india and the united arab emirates to use the indian rupee for nonoil commodity trading moving away from the dollar the shift dedollarization is spreading across the globe as more nations adopt local currencies for international trade diminishing the us dollars hegemony driven by geopolitical maneuvers and economic strategies to reduce dollar dependency this shift is reshaping international finance despite these shifts however there are doubts whether these trends will have a decisive impact on dollar dominance lets examine how this move towards dedollarization impacts the usds role in the global economy current state of dedollarization as of 2024 the dedollarization trend is progressively evident in various global economic patterns though the us dollar retains a robust position in the international financial system despite a diversifying landscape the dollar still accounts for about 69 of global currency usage and approximately 60 of disclosed foreign currency reserves worldwide​​ world allocated reserves by currency for 2023q4 source imf dedollarization profoundly affects the global economic landscape significantly impacting currency and commodity markets for instance the share of the us dollar in global foreign exchange reserves has decreased to a historic low of 58 a notable drop from 61 in 2022 this trend is driven by central banks diversifying their reserves into other currencies and assets like the euro which has increased its share to 21 furthermore gold reserves have grown substantially with central banks purchasing more gold in 2023 than in any previous year since records began in 1950 making up around 49 of chinas foreign reserves regarding currency transactions the us dollar continues to dominate accounting for 88 of daily transactions however the chinese renminbis rmb share has been growing steadily reaching 7 of global currency transactions in early 2024 up from less than 1 a decade ago this increase is supported by chinas efforts to internationalize the rmb by establishing global clearing centers and numerous currency swap agreements additionally countries are increasingly conducting bilateral trade in their local currencies to reduce dependence on the us dollar for example brazil and argentina now trade with china using the rmb and as of march 2024 529 of chinas international settlements were conducted in rmb surpassing the dollar for the first time russia has also significantly increased its use of the yuan for oil and other commodity transactions with 65 of its trade with china now settled in yuan dedollarization is influencing financial markets and investment strategies globally a shift away from the dollar poses risks to us financial assets analysts from morgan stanley warn that dedollarization could lead to a depreciation of us stocks which the dollars strength and liquidity have supported a weaker dollar could increase import prices and inflation potentially undermining investor confidence on the other hand dedollarization could alleviate the burden of dollardenominated debt for emerging markets countries like turkey and argentina which have faced economic crises due partly to their dollar liabilities could benefit from reduced dollar dependence the impacts of dedollarization are also evident in commodity markets particularly in the trading of oil and gold oil the petrodollar system initiated in 1974 effectively ended in june 2024 this system was a pivotal economic arrangement that mandated the sale of oil in us dollars thus entrenching the dollar as the dominant global reserve currency for decades this setup facilitated a substantial demand for the dollar because countries had to convert their local currencies into dollars to buy oil the world’s most traded commodity the agreements termination means that oilexporting countries are no longer obligated to conduct their transactions in us dollars saudi arabia for example has shifted to pricing and selling its oil in saudi riyals this move will cascade global oil trade dynamics influencing other nations currency reserves and trading practices india and china two of the largest oil importers need to hold higher reserves of saudi riyals to maintain their energy supplies this shift could significantly reduce the global demand for the us dollar in oil transactions which previously accounted for an estimated 17 trillion annually or about 20 of all us dollardenominated trade worldwide gold amidst a notable dedollarization trend central banks globally are increasingly purchasing gold to diversify away from the us dollar driven by geopolitical tensions and the desire to mitigate financial risks in 2022 central banks acquired a record 1136 metric tons of gold and in the first half of 2023 alone they added 387 metric tons to their reserves with china leading these purchases as part of its strategy to minimize reliance on the dollar​​​​ this movement towards gold is also bolstered by concerns over potential asset freezes prompting 41 of surveyed central banks and sovereign funds to anticipate increasing their gold holdings in the coming years​​ analysts predict that gold prices could range from 3000 per troy ounce by the end of 2024 reflecting ongoing economic uncertainties and sustained demand from central banks​​ is dedollarization a reality the debate over dedollarization often oscillates between viewing it as an imminent reality or dismissing it as a persistent myth based on the latest data and expert analysis as of june 2024 here are several potential scenarios and possibilities regarding the future of dedollarization scenario 1 gradual decline of dollar dominance the most likely scenario is a gradual decline in the us dollars dominance rather than a sudden collapse ● steady diversification central banks worldwide continue diversifying their reserves away from the us dollar the dollars share of global reserves has fallen from 59 in 2021 to 58 in 2023 this decline indicates a steady shift towards other currencies such as the euro which now holds 21 of reserves and the yuan ● increased use of other currencies the renminbis role in global finance gradually increases chinas international settlements in rmb have surpassed those in usd for the first time with 529 of transactions settled in rmb as of march 2024 compared to 428 in usd additionally bilateral trade agreements bypassing the dollar are becoming more common such as the agreements between brazil and china scenario 2 sudden geopolitical shifts a more dramatic scenario involves sudden geopolitical events that could accelerate dedollarization ● geopolitical tensions significant geopolitical events such as escalated tensions between the us and major global players like china and russia could hasten dedollarization efforts for instance the ongoing russiaukraine conflict has increased the use of nondollar currencies for russian trade particularly with china over the past year most of chinas oil imports from russia have been denominated in yuan ● sanctions and economic policies the us use of financial sanctions has driven some countries to seek alternatives to the dollar to mitigate the risk of economic isolation russias move to eliminate the us dollar from its national wealth fund is a case in point reducing its vulnerability to western sanctions scenario 3 technological transformation technological advancements particularly the rise of digital currencies could significantly impact the pace and extent of dedollarization ● central bank digital currencies cbdcs developing and adopting cbdcs could provide viable alternatives to the dollar for international transactions china’s digital yuan is a leading example already being used in crossborder transactions and potentially reducing reliance on the dollar by june 2024 nearly 100 cbdcs were globally in research or development stages with some already used for crossborder transactions ● blockchain and fintech innovations implementing technologies like blockchain could facilitate more efficient and secure international trade without needing a dominant reserve currency the brics pay initiative aims to streamline transactions among brics countries using blockchain an example of such innovation developed in 2018 this platform will enhance realtime transactions between member countries is dedollarization a myth despite the trends towards dedollarization many experts believe the us dollar will retain its dominant position for the foreseeable future the dollars enduring trust and liquidity are key factors in this it remains the most trusted and liquid currency worldwide accounting for approximately 69 of global currency usage with the euro at 23 it is also the preferred currency for international debt issuance and crossborder loans making up about 60 of disclosed foreign currency reserves the dollars entrenched global trade and finance position provides a robust foundation for example 88 of all overthecounter foreign exchange transactions involve the us dollar despite a gradual decline the dollars share in global export invoicing remains high alternatives like the euro and the renminbi face significant challenges despite its growth the renminbi accounts for only 23 of global payments via swift and 7 of global currency transactions other potential contenders lack the geopolitical and economic stability required for a currency to be a dominant reserve some analysts and economists believe cryptocurrencies could replace the dollar as an international payment which is also unlikely will never replace the us dollar because of its high volatility lack of centralized control and limited integration into the global financial system in the weekly timeframe usdollar after a strong fall in a longterm uptrend formed an ascending triangle pattern which is usually a classic bullish pattern bulls power and ma200 indicate bullish sentiment in the market so we can expect the to rise further on the rise above the resistance area ● usdollar buying can be considered on a break above the resistance at 106500 with a target of 109000 corresponding to 618 fibonacci expert opinions reinforce the dollars staying power analysts from institutions like the imf and jp morgan emphasize that while dedollarization is a trend to watch the complete displacement of the dollar is unlikely they highlight the resilience of the dollars dominance in global finance particularly given its pivotal role in international transactions and reserves conclusion despite the rising discourse on dedollarization the idea that the us dollar will lose its global dominance appears improbable while countries like china and russia actively pursue strategies to reduce their reliance on the dollar the global financial systems entrenched dependence on the greenback remains robust the dollars supremacy is underpinned by the extensive size and stability of the us economy its influential geopolitical position and the deep liquidity of its financial markets these factors create a resilient foundation for the dollar making a sudden shift towards alternative currencies highly unlikely,,,,,,,,Very Old

says",CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/ey-hong-kongs-ipo-market-is-set-to-improve-over-the-next-five-years.html,hong kong exchanges and clearing celebrates the 24th anniversary of its listing on june 21 2024 china news service china news service getty images beijing — the market for initial public offerings in hong kong is set to improve significantly over the next five years starting in the second half of this year george chan global ipo leader at ey told cnbc in an interview wednesday i think it will take a couple years to go back to the peak in 2021 but the trend is there chan said i can see the light at the end of the tunnel high us interest rates regulatory scrutiny slower economic growth and uschina tensions have constrained greater china ipos in the last three years ey said in a report that while the volume of ipos and proceeds in the us increased significantly in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago mainland china and hong kong saw a sharp decline in listings many of the macro trends are now starting to turn around which can support more ipos in hong kong said chan who is based in shanghai we are seeing a reversing trend he told cnbc we are seeing more of these us dollar funds they are moving back to hong kong the main reason is that hong kong has already factored in these uncertainties the hang seng index is up more than 5 yeartodate after four straight years of decline — which was the worst such losing streak in the history of the index according to wind information stock chart icon stock chart icon our hk cap markets team is very busy and has a strong pipeline for h2 we expect to see many hkse listings marcia ellis global cochair of private equity practice at morrison foerster in hong kong said in an email wednesday many companies that were waiting for a listing in mainland chinas a share market have decided to switch to one in hong kong she said previously china securities regulatory commission approval was slowing things down but recently our team has gotten csrc approvals pretty quickly in june china issued new measures to promote venture capital and authorities spoke publicly about supporting ipos especially in hong kong investors and analysts said they are now looking at the speed of ipo approvals for signs of a significant change chan said another supportive factor for hong kong ipos is that many of the companies listed in the market are based in mainland china where economic growth is quite satisfactory he expects consumer companies could be among the nearterm ipo beneficiaries as the economy slowly recovers a lot of people in china are willing to spend he said noting that was especially the case in less developed parts of the country official nationallevel data have showed that retail sales are growing more slowly in china — up by just 37 in may from a year ago versus growth of nearly 10 or more in prior years also significant for global asset allocation the us federal reserve and other major central banks are pulling back from aggressive interest rate hikes high rates have made treasury bonds a more attractive investment for many institutions instead of ipos i would say if the interest rate can be further cut down 1 maybe that would have a significant effect on the ipo market chan said hong kong ipos raised 15 billion during the first half of the year a 34 drop from a year ago ey said in a report released late last month back in 2021 and 2020 the hong kong stock exchange saw nearly 100 or more ipos a year raising tens of billions of dollars according to the report in comparison mainland china ipos raised 46 billion in the first six months of 2024 — a drop of 85 from the yearago period according to ey watch now bonnie chan ceo of hong kong exchanges and clearing limited said during a conference last week that so far this year the hong kong exchange has received 73 new listing applications — a 50 increase compared to the second half of last year she is not related to eys george chan the pipeline is building up nicely she said noting about 110 ipos in total are in line for a hong kong listing all we need is a set of good market conditions so these things get to launch and price nicely she added improving postipo performance what we need is a strong pipeline eys chan said we need an interested investor with the money to invest and we need a good aftermarket performance hong kong ipo returns are improving the average firstday return of new listings on the hong kong stock exchange in the first half of 2024 was 24 far more than the average of 1 in the same period last year according to ey the aftermarket performance of hong kong ipos has been doing quite good compared to the past five years chan said these things added together are projecting an upward trend for the hong kong market in the next 5 years chan said he expects the number of deals to pick up in the second half of 2024 watch now he said those will likely be mediumsized — between 2 billion hong kong dollars to 5 billion hong kong dollars 260 million to 640 million — but added he expects better market momentum in 2025 slowing economic growth and

wealthy customers lucky enough to be anointed as birkinbag worthy can purchase a birkin 25 for about 11000 and flip it the same day for more than 23000 analysts predict hermès could surpass louis vuitton in revenue within the next three years as the worlds largest luxury brand hermès stock is up 13 this year while lvmh shares are flat and kering is down 18 there is one luxury company however that has raced past hermès when it comes to growth and brand cache – ferrari this year ferrari for the first time surpassed hermès as the most valuable luxury company in the world as measured by stock multiple which gauges growth and profit prospects ferraris stock now trades at 50 times earnings compared with 48 for hermès and 23 for lvmh the storied automaker founded in 1947 by enzo ferrari as way to fund his race team debuted on the new york stock exchange at 60 a share in 2015 it now trades at 410 a share the company is valued at more than 75 billion — roughly 1½ times the market cap of ford or general motors which make millions of cars each year ferrari produced only 13663 cars last year ferrari is not a traditional luxury company of course it makes cars and has a race team a merchandise company a carrestoration company and many businesses that bear little resemblance to a maker of 1300 scarves and 800 sandals yet in a recent research report bernstein luxury analyst luca solca posits that ferrari and hermès are similar since both occupy the pinnacle of the pricing pyramid in their categories and are perfectly positioned to benefit from the surge in the global wealthy to better understand what makes ferrari a luxury brand cnbc traveled to ferrari headquarters in maranello italy to interview the companys ceo benedetto vigna get inside wealth directly to your inbox the inside wealth newsletter by robert frank is your weekly guide to highnetworth investors and the industries that serve them subscribe here to get access today vigna is an unlikely luxury king he spent most of his career at genevabased semiconductor maker stmicroelectronics where he ran its microelectromechanical systems and sensors group he helped create the screen sensor technology used in iphones for example his appointment to the top job at ferrari in 2021 was a sign that technology would be core to the supercar makers growth and in a sense the future of luxury in an interview at the companys 200 million ebuilding vigna talked about the upcoming electric ferrari its commitment to sustainability and current global demand for ferraris the main topic of conversation however was on what makes ferrari a leader in luxury and what lessons other companies and executives serving wealthy clients could heed from its rise here are five main takeaways 1 play hard to get ferrari purasangue suv adam jeffery cnbc as solca points out in his research note ferrari and hermès both sell less than the market would take a lot less based on orders analysts estimate ferrari could easily sell two or three times its current production ferraris allure was built on scarcity and exclusivity even if you can afford a ferrari with an average price of 380000 securing an order is nearly impossible the wait time for a purosangue ferraris pseudosuv and other hot models is now up to three years the longest in its history ask any ferrari dealer about their biggest problem and theyll say not enough cars too many frustrated clients but ceo vigna said the scarcity is part of ferraris brand promise we have to stay true to our founders strategy which is to always sell one car less than the market demands his strategy is to grow profit by making more on each car rather than making more cars we always want to push the quality of revenues over quantity he said indeed ferraris production increases over the years have lagged far behind the growth of wealthy potential buyers in 2010 it produced 6573 cars which means over the past 14 years production has doubled over the same period the global population of billionaires has more than tripled and so has the population of those worth 30 million and 100 million vigna said seeing a ferrari on the road should be like seeing a rare and exotic animal the imbalance also gives ferrari a unique position in the auto world the cars usually appreciate in value over time vigna said that if clients have to wait for one all the better waiting is part of the experience he said during cnbcs visit to the factory a ferrari customer took delivery of a new maroon 812 superfast he looked to be in his 70s or 80s when he saw the car and posed with it under the storied ferrari entrance gates his face lit up and he transformed into a 10yearold on christmas morning ferraris are special because they are still special 2 make emotion the driver the ferrari sp38 seen at goodwood festival of speed 2022 on june 23rd in chichester england martyn lucy getty images ask any ferrari fan or owner what makes a ferrari a ferrari and they might say the design the engine sound the handling the power the braking or the 100 years of racing history behind that bright yellow badge vigna says a true luxury product is defined by one chief characteristic emotion ferrari is a luxury company because its a company that is delivering a unique product its connecting with the most inner part of people the emotional side he said a luxury company is a company that is using technology innovation storytelling heritage everything with the ultimate goal to feed that emotional side that we all have vigna said ferrari will never produce vehicles that people simply need for transportation when i get invitations to talk to conferences i wont attend if i hear two words — utility or mobility we dont make a useful product we make an emotional product he told cnbc its similar to what lvmh chairman bernard arnault refers to as desirability its not enough to make a highquality product or an expensive product or one with more features or functions it has to tug at the heart 3 the art of pricing an inprogress ferrari at the supercar makers ebuilding in maranello italy crystal lau cnbc based on ferraris soaring prices youd think pricing is based on profit demands and wall streets obsession with margin growth yet vigna said the base price for each model is actually set about a month before its launch – in an unusual process the way we define price in our company is very simple he said one month before the car is ready for the unveil we go on the track — me and several people — and we drive it for a day or a day and a half and then with fresh emotion in our body we define the price its me the cmo and the cfo defining the price we share the emotion clearly those emotions are rising the cheapest ferrari in 2012 was the california with a manufacturers suggested retail price of 195000 todays entrylevel ferrari the roma starts at 273000 or 40 more ferrari is launching more limitededition and specialedition cars that command far higher prices the sf90 xx stradale starts at around 900000 and all 799 coupes and opentop spiders were sold out when it was unveiled the sp3 daytona with only 599 units starts at 23 million perhaps the biggest boost to profits is personalization todays ferrari buyers increasingly want custom paint colors leather fabrics stitching exposed carbonfiber and other personal details that make it their own those personal touches can add anywhere from 100000 to 500000 to the sale price vigna said his value over volume strategy means ferrari can grow profits in the double digits with only modest increases in cars made 4 the road to vip status ferrari would never admit it but dealers will tell you that customers have to work their way up a costly commercial ladder to get access to new ferraris and especially limited editions its similar to the path rolex buyers have to follow to eventually get a new daytona or hermès customers have to take to eventually get a birkin in short you start by buying a basic and sometimes less popular model then you can buy a slightly more desirable model or two or three if you attend ferrari events show support for the brand even join a ferrari racing program you can eventually become eligible for more expensive and even limitededition models nearly threequarters of all ferraris are sold to existing customers which means starting at the bottom of the ladder is difficult ferrari and hermès reserve their most desirable products for their most loyal customers solca said this in effect bundles access and amps up desirability 5 happy employees means happier customers workers at the new ferrari nv ebuilding factory in maranello italy on friday june 21 2024 the site in maranello built over the past couple of years in neartotal

colonies now the new united states of america had won their independence – the freedom we cherish today – from the british king and his oppressive government among the many thousands of american heroes who fought in the long sevenyear war there was one small group of men and women who history forgot why because they wanted it that way the group was known as the culper spy ring it was a network of spies for general george washington that successfully operated in and around new york city for five years without ever being discovered by the british the members of the ring knew the price they would pay if they were caught washingtons first attempt at placing a spy on long island had cost captain nathan hale his life a graduate of yale university hale was a schoolteacher he had no training as a spy but volunteered anyway hales mission to supply critical information to his commanding general failed within two weeks of volunteering for the assignment he was dead hanged by the british as a spy hales body was left hanging for several days as a warning to other wouldbe informants he was later buried in an unmarked grave george washington by weidenbach augustus image courtesy

of the new york militia being a good spymaster tallmadge kept the identities of his spies a closely guarded secret after all one loose lip one slip of the tongue by anyone could and would cost them their lives and possibly even the lives of their families according to mountvernonorg the major developed a way to identify his spies with pseudonyms and invented a numerical substitution system to identify his informants rather than use names seven hundred and sixtythree numbers were used with 711 denoting general washington 745 representing england and 727 for new york tallmadge and his associates also wrote their messages using invisible ink portrait miniature of benjamin tallmadge 17541835 image courtesy collection of the litchfield historical society litchfield connecticut the identities of the culper ring were such a closely guarded secret that even washington didnt know who they really were as brian kilmeade and don yaegar noted in their new york times bestselling book george washingtons secret six the spy ring that saved the american revolution several members of the ring townsend in particular had been insistent that washington never learn their names even after the war was over the members of the ring kept their identities a secret in april of 1790 washington visited long island including setauket where the ring had operated the oncecommanding general and now president of the united states reportedly visited with several members of the ring during his visit but whether he knew who they really were he did not say one member of the ring washington personally wanted to thank was townsend who had risked his life almost every day for his country but according to kilmeade and yaegar townsend never stepped out of the shadows to reveal himself to his commanderinchief it was a great honor to be sure but not one that townsend sought he did not want praise or celebration the greatest reward washington could give him was simply a return to a quiet and unassuming life as a man subject to no king but god tallmadge and the members of the culper ring took their secret to their graves the public wasnt aware of the spy rings existence until the 1930s townsends identity as samuel culper jr was discovered in 1929 after a historian was going through townsends old correspondence rivington was confirmed as being one of tallmadges spies in the 1950s even today theres still one spy who has yet to be identified – agent 355 some historians theorize 355 may have been a woman over the years there have been numerous monuments and statues erected to nathan hales sacrifice across the country high schools middle schools elementary schools university buildings dormitories a revolutionary war fort a us army installation in germany a us navy submarine and even a town in new york bears his name hale was officially designated connecticut’s state hero in 1985 yet there are no statues to be found of any members of the culper spy ring all of them deserve to stand alongside the many other heroes of the american revolution under the direction of tallmadge the culper spy ring risked everything to serve their new country in a war that had been deemed unwinnable by much of the world after all they were up against the british army one of the mightiest militaries on the planet at the time as kilmeade and yaegar wrote they never sought credit never received accolades and never revealed the risks they took or the sacrifices they made to serve our country the observation of british major george beckwith bears repeating washington did not really outfight the british he simply outspied us the authors noted so whats the lesson washingtons spies can still teach us the lesson of humility they protected one another by not revealing any of their wartime experiences good or bad they kept each others secrets to themselves for the rest of their lives in this social mediadriven look at me – tell all culture that we live in today it is a lesson from which we can all learn and perhaps that in itself is their best epitaph originally published july 4 2021,,,,,,,,Very Old

reach across time to speak to the hearts of americans even after nearly 250 years heres the entire declaration that led to americas freedom when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness — that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed — that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind is more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security — such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government the history of the present king of great britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world he has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people he has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within he has endeavored to prevent the population of these states for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands he has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers he has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries he has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world for imposing taxes on us without our consent for depriving us in many cases of the benefit of trial by jury for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighboring province establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies for taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments for suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever he has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends and brethren or to fall themselves by their hands he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people nor have we been wanting in attentions to our british brethren we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence they too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity we must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends we therefore the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the name and by authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain is and ought to be totally dissolved and that as free and independent states they have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce and to do all other acts and things which the independent states may of right do — and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection

after time off to lick my wounds i rebooked my test in january the earliest test i could get in late june 2024 the result of all this was that by the time i went for my second test last month i had spent at least £1000 on a year of unnecessary lessons and i had the pressure of knowing that if i failed i’d have to wait another six months and pay out yet again i am not alone in 2019 the average waiting time for a driving test at my local london test centre was 28 weeks as of 4 march 2024 it was 24 weeks four years on from the start of the covid19 pandemic which caused driving tests to be suspended the driver and vehicle standards agency dvsa which carries out the tests in great britain northern ireland is the responsibility of the driver and vehicle agency has not recovered while waiting times are coming down in wales and scotland in england the situation is getting worse in march 2022 the average waiting time for a practical car driving test in england was 145 weeks in march 2023 it was 158 weeks as of march 2024 it was 178 weeks more than double the sevenweek target set out in the dvsa’s annual report you give them your personal information they use it to abuse the system and create a bigger backlog and it goes on’ max sobol but according to the dvsa i am the problem me and all the other learner drivers for booking driving tests before they’re ready as a result says the dvsa chief executive loveday ryder in a chiding blog post “those who need to drive for their job such as nurses and carers” aren’t able to access tests if only we’d stop being so irresponsible nhs nurses and carers could go to work there is a straightforward way to determine whether this is true if learner drivers booking tests when they aren’t ready is causing the backlog the pass rate would be down postcovid but guardian analysis of dvsa data reveals that the pass rate for learner drivers has actually gone up postpandemic in the five years from april 2014 to march 2019 the average pass rate in england was 478 whereas postcovid from april 2021 to december 2023 it averaged 482 england is no outlier throughout great britain the pass rate postcovid is higher – 466 for april 2014 to march 2019 versus 489 for april 2021 to december 2023 so if learner drivers aren’t the problem what’s really going on at the dvsa “it’s like waiting for festival tickets” says calu malta 27 who works for a nonprofit organisation in march she woke up at 6am on a monday morning when the dvsa releases new tests to book a driving test near her home in north london malta will have to wait six months for her test in august when a test becomes available says sue smith 62 a newbury driving instructor who searches for her students “it’s like having heart palpitations you have to have the fastest fingers in the west” as a result some learners are seeing their theory tests which are only valid for two years expire before they can pass there is a way to get a test faster – on the black market dozens of businesses offer fasttrack tests advertised through whatsapp groups websites and driving schools the array of dates on offer is staggering fees range from £120 to £350 for tests that should cost £62 view image in fullscreen max sobol ‘i suppose it’s silly giving these companies your driving licence details but it’s the only way you can get a test’ photograph alicia canterthe guardian when faced with an impossible dilemma – spend hundreds on extra lessons or pay touts – many decide that the second option is cheaper “it’s unfair” says dan cloake a 35yearold lighting technician from east london in april he paid £170 for a fasttrack driving test through a whatsapp group promising “early driving bookings” “this is a public service and we are having to pay this private tax” in order to book his test cloake sent the touts a photo of his provisional driving licence “it had my home address my date of birth quite a lot of personal information on it” he says is he worried about what the touts have done with his data i ask “yeah” says cloake slowly “a little bit now i am thinking about it” “it is a constant battle to keep on top of these bot things” said ryder when giving evidence to the transport committee last july touts use automated software known as bots to reload the dvsa website until a test becomes available then grab it “it’s all above board” insists a bradfordbased driving instructor as he offers me a fasttrack driving test slot for £200 “nothing illegal” i’ve called asking for his assistance in booking a driving test in thornbury where waiting times last year averaged 24 weeks “you tell me when you need it” he says genially he’s right it’s not illegal to sell a driving test for profit although it is a violation of the dvsa’s terms of use but when you examine how the touts operate evidence of illegality emerges there are two main ways to book a driving test the public access system open to the general public and the business system accessible to driving instructors and driving schools on the business system instructors and schools can book multiple tests and crucially they can swap tests between different learners but in order to book a test everyone including instructors needs a provisional driving licence registered to someone who has passed their theory test so how do the test companies do it “on our system” boasts the director of one firm that offers fasttrack test slots for between £190 and £250 “we have loads and loads of other licences all looking for test dates so what we’re able to do using their licence is hold and reserve test dates basically swap people in” the smoothtalking londoner says that one of the agencies he partners with to book tests has “8000 licences able to hold and reserve test dates for other customers and as soon as one comes available they’ll hold it reserve it wait for the customer to confirm then just swap them in” view image in fullscreen waiting for a driving test is like ‘waiting for festival tickets’ says learner driver calu malta photograph macanaalamy this is how some touts operate by reserving tests using other people’s driving licences without their consent in a probable violation of data protection laws and then switching in the details of whoever buys the test a time out writer recently wrote about having her driving licence used to book 53 tests without her knowledge she’d previously given her details to touts fraudsters have even sent out phishing emails purporting to be from the dvsa asking driving instructors to share learners’ licences “the police don’t have the resources to take proper action against fraud” says dr ben collier an online crime expert at the university of edinburgh “frauds like this are almost seen as not illegal” in the driving instructor community it’s common knowledge that some instructors participate in these scams to the frustration of their peers “instructors are buying tests” says simon brady 59 an instructor from bradford “they do it without their pupil’s knowledge they get their driving licence details and sell it to someone else” when max sobol a 39yearold film director from east london paid £132 for a fasttrack driving test in april 2022 he sent a photo of his driving licence over whatsapp to the touts sobol failed his test in may and struggled to book another not wanting to pay for another black market test sobol’s partner contacted the dvsa in july 2022 – only for the dvsa to tell her that sobol actually had a test booked for that october stopping the ability to swap tests means the scam will fall to pieces it’s the only solution but the dvsa won’t do it simon brady driving instructor “i suppose it’s silly to be giving these companies your driving licence details” sobol says “but it’s the only way you can get a test you give them your personal information they use it to abuse the system and create a bigger backlog and it goes on you’re over a barrel with it” like an arsonist who burns down your house then sells you a tent the touts offer a solution to a problem they created but ryder doesn’t see the black market touts as fuelling the crisis only as a symptom of it “this problem” she told the committee “will go away when the wait times come down” as well as blaming long waiting times on the public for booking tests before they are ready the dvsa has pointed the finger at the people who carry them out driving examiners went on strike in december 2022 and january 2023 “we were seeing a steady improvement … until the industrial action part started” ryder told the select committee the dvsa does not appear to have undertaken much soulsearching about whether it might have done anything differently after scores of driving instructors left angry comments under a post about waiting times the dvsa turned off comments on a subsequent post “this is not about censoring your views” it said yet the cause of the waiting times crisis is simple there aren’t enough tests to clear the backlog and many of those that are available are being sold on the black market according to guardian analysis of dvsa data as of 2024 the total covid backlog for great britain is more than 1m tests since pandemic restrictions ended in 2021 the agency has made available an extra 212000 tests meaning that at the current rate it will not clear the covid backlog until 2026 “the core of this problem is that there are not enough practical tests for everyone” says rachel newland 46 a driving instructor from reading “and the reason for that is that there is an examiner retention crisis until the dvsa acknowledges that nothing will be fixed” newland campaigns for the dvsa to increase examiner pay a petition she set up currently has 1883 signatures view image in fullscreen paul weinberger who has created a bot to get around block bookings by companies photograph jill meadthe guardian as of july 2023 the dvsa had recruited 474 new driving examiners since march 2021 but about 15 examiners quit each month it’s not hard to see why examiners test seven students a day work weekends for no additional pay and are often abused by members of the public for all of this they are paid about £27000 a year as civil servants driving examiners cannot speak to the media but conversations with wellplaced sources reveal a stressedout workforce candidates are angry at having to wait so long for tests and take it out on them they are being sent out with unsafe candidates in nondual control cars they are genuinely fearful of crashes they feel frustrated and underappreciated another strike was narrowly avoided earlier this year because the government determines civil service pay the dvsa cannot put up salaries but it could ask the government to make reselling tests illegal “stop the ability to swap tests” says brady “then the whole scam will fall to pieces it’s the only solution but the dvsa won’t do it” the dvsa is resistant to this change because most driving instructors use the testswapping service responsibly to trade candidates who aren’t ready for their tests with candidates who are yet those benefits are marginal given the way the system facilitates an exploitative black market we cannot swap gp appointments or primary school places or nhs operations why must we be able to switch driving tests in the absence of the one change that would work the dvsa has reduced the amount of times driving tests can be changed from 10 to six and implemented more antibot protections incorporating ai technology it says it has created nearly 150000 new tests and redeployed managers to help clear the backlog it has a counterfraud team that reports to social media networks if necessary to date it has issued 231 warnings suspended 687 accounts and closed 570 accounts for misuse of the booking system and removed 4700 accounts that were not linked to approved driving instructors it urges the public only to book their driving tests themselves or through their driving instructor to prevent their information being misused,,,,,,,,Very Old

energy commodity trading in muted reaction to prospect of labour victory jillian ambrose the muted market reaction to the prospect of a labour party victory in the uk’s general election is evident even in energy commodity markets today where traders are not expecting to be caught out by any surprises “election results look quite certain” one trader told the guardian “commodity traders won’t be working past 5pm” the potential for labour’s manifesto points to translate into price movements appears limited according to robbie jacksonstroud an analyst at commodities data provider icis jacksonstroud said that any policies designed to spur the development and construction of new energy capacity requires time to agree upon at a policy level as well as planning and then construction he added that “cost constraints in the current climate are the driver of investment in renewable capacity and a change of party does not shift that” but the commodity market’s underwhelming response to a potential labour government has had one exception the uk’s market for carbon credits traders have placed record bets that the price of uk carbon allowances known as ukas would rise on the basis that a future labour government would bring in tougher climate policies making it more expensive to pollute “uka prices have already rallied on expectation of improved green policies and the possibility that the uk’s carbon market may link with the eu market under a labour government” the trader said the benchmark uka price climbed to highs of £50 a tonne in the weeks after the election was announced from

tomorrow according to eu officials they are aimed at stemming what european commission president ursula von der leyen has described as a flood of cheap chinesemade evs built with state subsidies however there is a fourmonth window during which the duties are only provisional and intense talks are expected to continue between the two sides at the end of the period the commission the eu’s executive arm could impose “definite duties” that typically apply for five years on which eu members would vote dombrovskis said our aim is to… ensure fair competition and level playing field therefore once again we do not see any basis for retaliation those talks with china are ongoing and indeed should a mutually beneficial solution emerge we can also find ways not to apply at the end of the day the tariffs the provisional rates are almost exactly those announced by the commission on 12 june beijing said at the time that it would take “all necessary measures” to safeguard china’s interests these could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to china of european products such as cognac and pork eu to put tariffs of up to 38 on chinese electric vehicles as trade war looms read

ago by joão da silva business reporter share getty images mg owner saic is one the car makers hardest hit by the new tariffs the european union has raised tariffs on chinese electric vehicles as brussels takes action to protect the blocs motor industry the new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 174 to 376 which is on top of a 10 duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from china this could raise the price of evs across the eu making them less affordable for european consumers the move is also a major blow for beijing which is already in a trade war with washington the eu is the largest overseas market for china’s ev industry and the country is counting on hightech products to help revive its flagging economy eu officials say this rise in imports was boosted by unfair subsidisation which allowed chinamade evs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc china has denied this repeated allegation from the us and the eu beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports the new charges come into effect on friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into chinese state support for the countrys ev makers continues they are not likely to be imposed until later this year so who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute it is not just chinese brands that are affected by the move western firms that make cars in china have also come under scrutiny by brussels by imposing tariffs brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market the eu’s decision may seem tame compared to a recent us move to raise its total tariffs to 100 but it could be far more consequential chinese evs are a relatively rare sight on us roads but much more common in the eu the number of evs sold by chinese brands across the eu rose from just 04 of the total ev market in 2019 to almost 8 last year according to figures from the influential brusselsbased green group transport and environment te patryk krupcala an architect from poland who expects to take delivery of a brand new chinamade mg4 in two weeks told the bbc i have chosen an mg4 because it is quite cheap it is a really fast car and its a rearwheel drive like my previous car which was bmw e46 te projects firms like byd and shanghai automotive industry corporation saic the chinese owner of the formerly british brand mg could reach a market share of 20 by 2027 but not all chinesemade evs will be hit equally by the new tariffs winners and losers they were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut based on these criteria the european commission has set individual duties on three chinese ev brands saic byd and geely saic has been hit with the highest new tariff of 376 stateowned saic is the chinese partner of volkswagen and general motors it also owns mg which produces one of the topselling evs in europe the mg4 the price for not cooperating is a severe blow to saic which gets 154 of its global revenues from ev sales in europe says rhodium group an independent research firm for mr krupcala who bought his mg4 before the tariffs hit the eus move does not matter much i dont really care about the tariffs i have a nice car with a sevenyear warranty for chinas largest ev maker byd it is a different story as it faces an extra duty of 174 on the vehicles it ships from china to the eu that is the lowest increase and one that according to research by dutch bank ing will give the automaker an advantage in the european market luís filipe costa an insurance industry executive from portugal who has just bought a byd seal says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car but he added that even if the european commissions new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with byd because other brands would also be affected portuguese executive luís filipe costa chose a byd seal over western brands geely which owns swedens volvo will see an additional tariff of 199 according to spanish bank bbva the company will still export to the eu profitably but its profits will be significantly reduced other firms including european car makers operating factories in china or through joint ventures will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the eu those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 208 while those eu investigators see as noncooperative will pay the higher tariff of 376 usbased tesla which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from china to europe has asked for an individually calculated rate which eu officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation still the firm has posted a notice on some of its european websites that prices for its shanghaimade model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs last year businessman lars koopmann who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is germany bought a chinamade tesla model y mr koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the cars hightech features such as the large touch screen price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium german brands mr koopmann says if the tariffs had been in place they would have always affected my decision localising production while some chinabased exporters will be better off than others it is clear from the european commissions plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to europe the hardest hit will be saic brands like mg as well as joint ventures between foreign and chinese firms in china which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to europe rhodium says the biggest beneficiaries of the duties are europeanbased producers with limited china exposure such as renault in other words the duties are likely to do as the eu hopes they would cut the number of chinesemade evs coming into the region easing pressure on local manufacturers there is also another result of the move some big chinese ev firms are planning to build production capacity in the eu which could help shield them from the new duties work on byds first european factory is well under way in hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year chinese car maker chery has recently signed a jointventure deal with a spanish firm that will see the two companies making evs and other types of cars in barcelona and saic is looking to secure a site for its first factory in europe it’s a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the eu instead of relying on exporting from china said bill russo from shanghaibased consulting group automobility the fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the eu,,,,,,,,Very Old

the month last month marked the continuation of a strong year for crowdstrike stock which has returned 505 ytd june was indeed an eventful month for the company as it was added to the sp 500 on june 24 however the major catalyst for crowdstrike was its firstquarter fiscal2025 earnings report released on june 4 following this blowout earnings report on june 4 crowdstrike stock jumped from 305 per share to 343 per share the next day and kept rising from there one could see why as crowdstrike posted a 33 yearoveryear increase in revenue to 921 million while net income skyrocketed from 05 million

in june and its stock price is up about 47 ytd like the other two stocks on this list broadcom stock was fueled by an excellent quarterly earnings report in june the company grew revenue by 43 year over year in its fiscal second quarter to 125 billion its net income tumbled about 40 year over year but that was impacted by expenses related to the acquisition of vmware nyse last year however the adjusted net income minus acquisition costs and other onetime expenses soared 20 to 54 billion or 1096 per share those gains were driven by its ai chips which generated record revenue in the quarter the other huge catalyst was the announcement of a 10forone stock split which will take effect on july 15 when the split kicks in investors will receive nine additional shares for every share they own the stock split could also fuel future growth as broadcom’s share price will be lower by a factor of 10 making it more accessible to more investors it is currently trading at 1638 per share beware valuations amid the potential all three of these stocks are trading at high multiples so be mindful of their valuations however all have excellent earnings potential and are worth considering as longterm options most immediately look for broadcom to potentially pop after the stock split but again keep an eye on the pricetoearnings ratio,,,,,,,,Very Old

arsenal of missiles and is estimated to have 10 times the military capability of hamas the question is can the iron dome be overrun payloads that hamas could not dream of an allout war between israel and hezbollah would be devastating for both sides already at least 150000 residents of southern lebanon and northern israel have been evacuated from their homes and are internally displaced because of the regular crossborder fire retired israel defense forces col miri eisin who directs the international institute for counterterrorism in israel said the iron dome would not be overrun in the sense of failing to work altogether rather its interception success rate will likely fall amid largescale missile attacks meaning more damage to israeli infrastructure and more casualties our capabilities to intercept are very high but the percentage will go down and that means that they will be able to hit and do damage in the heart of israel eisin said adding that could include vital infrastructure like power plants and the countrys tel aviv international airport hezbollah has payloads that hamas could not dream of she said i would say that theres an expectation of hundreds of killed of thousands of casualties and of a very challenging time period at the local level watch now the lebanese shiite organization which was born in 1982 during israels occupation of southern lebanon with funding from iran is now considered one of the most heavily armed nonstate groups in the world most estimates credibly put hizbullahs missile and rocket stockpile at 150000 victor tricaud a senior analyst at consulting firm control risks told cnbc hamas rockets and missiles by comparison are estimated to number in the tens of thousands more significantly tricaud said hezbollah has far more advanced weapons systems than hamas including iraniansupplied guided fateh missiles as well as drones such munitions would stand significantly greater chances to evade israels air defense systems … and would be likely to inflict significant damage to critical economic infrastructure across israel he said a fullblown war would also be highly destructive for lebanon which is in the midst of an economic and political crisis and whose infrastructure is wholly unprepared for a new war a major israeli incursion and the damage it would bring particularly to the hezbollah stronghold of southern lebanon could threaten the groups standing and support there a hell of a lot more damage israel and hezbollah went to war in 2006 in a 34day conflict that was claimed as a victory by hezbollah and seen as a strategic failure in israel a report by israels reichman university titled fire and blood the chilling reality facing israel in a war with hezbollah outlined a scenario in which hezbollah would fire 2500 to 3000 missiles and rockets a day for several weeks targeting israeli military and civilian sites for reference hezbollah fired an estimated 4000 rockets at israel over the course of the entire

somewhat strange and ironic political shift has gripped europe over the last few years in the formerly brexiting euroskeptic uk the pendulum has just swung back to the centerleft labour party which comes to power after a mammoth election win ending 14 years of conservative party rule a different picture is playing out in much of western europe — and in countries that disdained brexit and the uks populist trend in recent years over the last decade or so these states are now seeing their own electorates shift to the right with nationalist populist and euroskeptic parties riding high in voter polls and entering the corridors of power while the uk and mainland europe are heading in different directions politically analysts say that the driving force behind changing patterns at the polls is fundamentally the same voters are desperate for change theres an antiincumbency mood again in europe dan stevens professor of politics at exeter university told cnbc no matter who the incumbent is stevens said theres just a general dissatisfaction and want for change tapping into the zeitgeist among british voters the uks labour party used change as its rallying cry for voters ahead of thursdays general election which it won with a landslide watch now the shift to the left comes after a tumultuous period in british politics during the last series of conservative governments with immigration concerns and euroskepticism culminating in the 2016 referendum to leave the european union more challenges followed throughout the covid19 pandemic war in ukraine and a costofliving crisis by the time the british election was called brits were just fed up analysts said shared concerns the uk is not alone in looking for a political change of scenery a similar shift has been observed in much of western and eastern europe in recent years with hardright populist and nationalist parties upsetting and unseating the old political establishment italy the netherlands germany and france have all seen farright parties — such as fratelli ditalia the party for freedom alternative for germany or national rally — rise up in opinion polls or win elections watch now such parties often emerged as protest factions standing on an antiimmigration or euroskeptic platform but theyve since taken a more mainstream approach to attract a wider section of the electorate who are concerned over broader universal issues such as jobs education health care national identity and the economy the latter issue is a particular driver of voting change with rising food and energy costs and declining disposable household incomes having the most direct and decisive impact on voters if you have very poor economic performance then you would expect the political pendulum to swing and when it swings it it goes to the other side from where it is at present it is swinging because people are hard up and aggravated its as simple as that christopher granville managing director of emea and global politics at ts lombard told cnbc signaling that the turn of tide has not favored incumbent leaderships of course theres a huge debate about the extent to which the respective governments are responsible for this poor economic performance you can argue that theyve been disastrously incompetent or you can argue that theyve been innocent victims of external shocks such as the energy crisis provoked by the war in ukraine the cost of living crisis etc granville added wherever you stand on that debate the reality is the same that the voters wants to swing the pendulum protest vote many political experts pin the rise of the hard right in europe on voters wanting to protest against the political status quo and its often longstanding establishment figures and parties right wing and hardright parties are not only winning because of immigration yes thats their signature topic but they have been able to win because they attract a coalition of voters voting for them for different reasons sofia vasilopoulou professor of european politics at kings college london told cnbc they have a number of groups who are what i call peripheral voters who tend to vote with them because of a lack of trust in politics lack of trust in institutions fatigue with the status quo she said its a kind of a protest against politics in general and theres quite a lot of voters that they get because of that

A0213,2024-07-05,311,End Times and Israel: 'God's Covenant With the Jewish People' and Evangelical Support Amid Gaza War,CBN,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2024/july/end-times-and-israel-gods-covenant-with-the-jewish-people-and-the-gaza-chaos,evangelical support for israel has remained unchanged amid the ongoing israelhamas war in gaza according to a recent survey researchers found the belief that “god’s covenant with the jewish people remains intact today” serves as the greatest impact on support for the jewish state listen to the latest episode of “quick start” “if a respondent professes this belief the likelihood that this person strongly supports israel increases almost threefold 180” reads a press release from researchers behind the study dr motti inbari a professor of jewish studies at unc pembroke and dr kirill bumin associate dean of metropolitan college and director of boston university summer term programs explained to cbn news what they found most stunning about the latest data “we’ve been doing this research for quite some time” bumin said “and one of the things that i find particularly interesting is the degree to which the attitudes that we see in the christian community are crystallized or rigid” he continued “we have seen relatively little change in attitudes towards support for israel support for palestinians or support for neither from 2021 onward” bumin said this persists even after the oct 7 attack and subsequent war broke out another factor of interest was generational differences the researchers observed among young evangelicals who have been found to be less supportive — particularly those under the age of 20 — of israel “this is the case even after we take into account their religious attendance their specific religious beliefs political beliefs socialization in proisrael circles” bumin said “there’s definitely something very distinct about the under30 crowd especially in comparison to the 50 to 64yearold respondents who are even more supportive of israel than the 65plus crowd” inbari said the younger generation has more access to information on social media and other platforms — tools older generations aren’t as accustomed to he said these platforms by design create an echo chamber dynamic as people are primarily served only the content they want to see and hear “you’re in … your own mindset and you’re not exposed to other views” he said “and this creates a lot of polarization also as a result … another aspect is that it’s very visual you can see things that back when i was younger in that age when i was opening the newspaper i was reading now they see they don’t read they see it creates a different effect” as for evangelical support more generally bumin said an embrace of the biblical narrative particularly the abrahamic covenant is “exceptionally important” to explain why evangelicals have such a positive view of israel “support for abrahamic covenant — this notion that god’s covenant with the jewish people is intact and eternal and that as a result of gentiles supporting abrahamic covenant that there are blessings for the gentiles to be had … that aspect has repeatedly received support not only in the evangelical community but indeed across all christian denominations … that we have studied” he said “in fact in our 2024 survey that is the no 1 most impactful variable that we’ve considered in terms of relative impact on people’s attitudes … in terms of support for israel” the theological elements don’t end there though as bumin also cited evangelicals’ views on the end times particularly premillennialism according to gotquestionsorg premillennialism is the “view that christ’s second coming will occur prior to his millennial kingdom and that the millennial kingdom is a literal 1000year reign of christ on earth” bumin said premillennialism offers a “very clearcut picture” of the role of the jewish people and israel in the end of days with jerusalem taking center stage this theological construct he said helps consistently affirm support for israel especially in this context “we also find for evangelicals again and again that ascribing to a particular theology or theological view related to end times known as premillennialism has been really important” bumin continued “there are a lot of different elements to these millennial views there’s a premillennialism postmillennialism amillennialism but the most important aspect in terms of these views for us is the relationship to the jewish people and israel in the end times” inbari noted that younger evangelicals are much less inclined to take a premillennial view showcasing how this might impact the aforementioned decreased support they show for the jewish state “it’s another way to explain why young evangelicals are drifting away from supporting israel” he said “it’s part of the eschatological view that is part of that mix as well” inbari and bumin also spoke about the current war in gaza and its relation to views on israel and palestine watch the video above for more,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0214,2024-07-05,311,How Liberty Flowed From Ancient Israel to the New America,CBN,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2017/june/how-liberty-flowed-from-ancient-israel-to-the-new-america,how liberty flowed from ancient israel to the new america hartford conn jerusalem — the idea that liberty should reign in america didnt start with the declaration of independence or the 4th of july 1776 the seeds were planted more than a hundred years before in the soil of the new world one of the most important was in what would become connecticut a vast wilderness awaited the hundred hardy christians who left cambridge massachusetts in 1636 with the rev thomas hooker to settle what is now hartford connecticut in such a wild land they asked the popular pastor how they should govern it what rev hooker preached on may 31st 1638 was so profound it sowed the seeds of free constitutional government in america thats what it says at the base of a statue of hooker that stands in hartford to commemorate the man who helped form a free nation free consent of the people the key words in that sermon were the foundation of authority is laid firstly in the free consent of the people in other words not that a king or emperor should rule them but the people themselves should be the rulers his pushing this idea is why some historians have labeled hooker the father of american democracy hookers fellow pioneers ran with the idea of the free consent of the people according to william federer author of the historical series american minute which can be found at wwwamericanminutecom this was revolutionary and it turned into the fundamental orders of connecticut which is considered the first written constitution in modern times federer told cbn news this insistence on the people having free consent is a part of what drove hooker and his fellow settlers to get out of the puritan cambridge radio talk show host michael medved explained its precisely what led thomas hooker to found connecticut to leave massachusetts he was having an argument with other pastors he didnt see it the way they did its john cotton versus thomas hooker and part of what it has to do with is suffrage is the ability of people to vote and to make their own decisions theres another statue in hartford of a pioneer family with their heads bowed the father kneeling in prayer a plaque behind them says here they established the form of government upon which the present us constitution is modeled which starts off how federer asked he answered we the people radical idea in a world of kings potentates the historian pointed out how radical this was after 6000 years of almost nothing but rule by kings and emperors pharaohs and potentates and they believed in a topdown form of government where god gives all the power and the rights to the king and hes gods lieutenant who dispenses it to the people federer said colonialists like hooker turned that on its head federer – who authored who is the king in america explained americas founders when they got the chance they wanted to run away from a king and they flipped it and made the people the king medved summed up their bedrock belief all of us have the same ultimate sovereign god almighty but that god almighty does not appoint and designate crowned heads over us the power comes from the people federer recalled john jay the first chief justice said the people are the sovereign of this country and they practice that sovereignty as they all head to the polls to pick their representatives in government hooker is just one of many preachers who pushed the colonies toward liberty and rule by the people many historians suggest in their earliest days preachers were often the most influential thought leaders in the colonies fearing establishment of religion in fact religion was such a powerful force that most colonies named the most powerful denomination in a particular colony the official church there thats establishment of religion all of these colonies were deeply religious all of them and all of them deeply christian medved said but they were christian in distinctive ways and the different christian denominations then as now distrusted each other the puritans in massachusetts and connecticut did not like the anglicans in north carolina and virginia and then you had quakers who nobody liked who were in pennsylvania medved explained as the colonies were forming the newly independent nation of america they were concerned about how this establishment of religion could actually dampen some of that freedom for instance medved pointed out virginia was the most powerful colony it was the most populous and the most powerful and people were very afraid that virginia would use that power to establish the anglican church they didnt want to go from being ruled over by a king they didnt respect to being dictated to by a denomination they didnt even belong to as federer put it they didnt want a federal walmart to come into town and put out of business their local momandpop denomination medved asked what do you do when you have these different states different requirements different religions you make a first amendment which says congress shall make no law respecting establishment of religion he argued though that in no way suggested they wanted to be free of religion or god in fact they openly praised him and gave him credit for his hand in theyre becoming a free nation american experiment american miracle the one idea that seemed to unite all the founders was the idea of providence medved stated the idea that they were doing gods work that this american experiment was ultimately an american miracle which just happens to be the name of medveds new book the american miracle divine providence in the rise of the republic still all these preachers and founding fathers did have a model for another time when god freed a people from rule by an allpowerful potentate and showed them the concept of liberty and how to rule themselves guided by his hand when moses took the children of israel out of egypt that was the first instance in world history of an entire nation with no king federer pointed out hebrew republic inspired them pilgrims and puritans crushed under european kings studied this ancient hebrew republic and took the dream to emulate it with them as they fled to north america one thing after another was revolutionary in this hebrew republic such as the tribes electing their own leaders and that all people were to be treated as equals israel was the beginning of the concept of equality on planet earth federer said it was also the first nation where everyone was taught to read so they all could be taught the law and each had a hand in enforcing it and maintaining it along with the nation itself so they didnt need a standing army which in many nations becomes a tool in the hands of a powerhungry ruler you have a king he has an army to enforce his will federer explained in israel every man was in the militia and armed and ready at a moments notice to defend his family and his community he added israel had no police not only did everyone get taught the law everyone was responsible to help enforce the law finding freedom in the god of liberty but what was to keep all this freedom from spiraling down into anarchy federer explained ancient israel had the key ingredient a god who was watching everyone he wants you to be fair and hes going to hold you accountable in the future if everybody in the country believes this you can maintain complete order with no police maximum liberty federer declared the founding fathers believed fervently that god made mankind to be free and wanted them to have this sort of maximum liberty federer concluded that allowed america to blossom into this amazing experiment of the people getting to be king and each individual citizen accountable to god first published june 30 2017,,,,,,,,Very Old

party expected to win a huge majority in a parliamentary election ending 14 years of often tumultuous conservative government by trouncing rishi sunaks party with many results still to be announced from thursdays vote centreleft labour has already won more than 326 of the 650 seats in parliament with an exit poll suggesting it would capture about 410 on a humiliating night for sunak the conservatives have so far only won 70 and were predicted to suffer the worst performance in the partys long history with voters punishing them for a cost of living crisis failing public services and a series of scandals tonight people here and around the country have spoken and theyre ready for change to end the politics of performance a return to politics as public service starmer said after winning his seat in london the change begins right here you have voted it is now time for us to deliver keir starmer leader of britains labour party and his wife victoria starmer attend a reception to celebrate starmers win in the election at tate modern in london britain july 5 2024 photo credit reuters sunak conceded defeat and said he had called starmer to congratulate him on his victory today power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner with goodwill on all sides he said after regaining his seat there is much to learn and reflect on and i take responsibility for the loss to the many good hardworking conservative candidates i am sorry despite his convincing victory polls have suggested there is little enthusiasm for starmer or his party and he comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges britains tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after world war two net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output living standards have fallen and public services are creaking especially the much cherished national health service which has been dogged by strikes he has already had to scale back some of labours more ambitious plans such as its flagship green spending pledges while he has promised not to raise taxes for working people much of the heavy damage to the conservative support was inflicted by the rightwing populist reform uk party headed by brexit campaigner nigel farage who had campaigned strongly on curbing immigration starmer has promised to scrap the conservatives controversial policy of sending asylum seekers to rwanda but will be under pressure himself to find a solution to stopping tens of thousands of people arriving across the channel on small boats within the conservative party the recriminations and debate over its future direction immediately began with some saying its failure stemmed from abandoning the centre ground while others argued reform had won over voters who felt the party had deserted its roots reform captured four seats with farage himself finally being elected to parliament at his eighth attempt and won more votes than the conservatives across swathes of the country there is a massive gap on the centre right of british politics and my job is to fill it and thats exactly what im going to do a triumphant farage said believe me folks this is just the first step of something that is going to stun all of you keir starmer leader of britains labour party and his wife victoria starmer greet supporters as they attend a reception to celebrate starmers win in the election at tate modern in london britain july 5 2024 photo credit reuters the rise in support for a populist alternative echoed recent similar results in europe where the far right have been surging but unlike france where marine le pens farright national rally party made historic gains in an election last sunday overall the british public has plumped for a centreleft party to bring about change starmer has promised to improve relations with the european union to resolve issues created by brexit just as farright politicians are enjoying success however despite opposing brexit rejoining the european union is not on the table he may also have to work with donald trump in the united states if he wins novembers presidential election but he has vowed to continue londons unequivocal support for ukraine the election victory would represent an incredible turnaround for starmer and labour which critics and supporters said was facing an existential crisis just three years ago when it appeared to have lost its way after its 2019 drubbing but a series of conservative scandals most notably revelations of parties in downing street during covid lockdowns undermined then

you broke into george odenyo’s office at delta corner annex you would face two puzzling scenarios one you wouldn’t be able to nick anything and two you’d be hardpressed to know what he does for a living this is because his office is bare there is a table with a computer no papers no trays no photos of his family no trophies there is a lonesome coat hanger and a small glass plaque that his children gifted him for father’s day it brings to mind that quote by ram dass “emptiness is not really empty emptiness is full of everything the ‘everything’ just isn’t manifest” or he might just be a minimalist odenyo is the ceo of american tower company atc kenya operations a subsidiary of american tower corporation it is an american real estate investment firm that owns develops and operates wireless and broadcast communication infrastructure towers telecom masts in several countries atc owns about 4000 towers across kenya that host telkom safaricom airtel and other small telecom companies on a shared infrastructure platform his resume is as minimalist as his office he’s worked in two organisations according to his linkedin profile for 14 years he worked with mtn business leaving as head of finance then five years with eaton towers as finance director before the company was acquired by atc your desk is so bare are you a minimalist or are you hardly in the office i have the right team in the company so my desk doesn’t have to look busy part of me is also opposed to holding onto things i try to release them as soon as possible if theres nothing i can do with it i give it to the next person who can address it what does it take to build one first our customer the operator has to identify where they want the tower which is driven by need often determined by the population we will then acquire the site and get the necessary permits from the national environmental management authority kenya civil aviation and county governments once we acquire the site we erect the tower and then power it with a grid as a numbers guy how do you find transitioning to dealing with people well i have appreciated that as a leader you are as strong as your people i have led teams in my previous roles so it’s not entirely new people can be difficult but the trick lies in figuring out how to understand them everybody is motivated by something a dream or ambition and it’s upon you to connect them with whatever it is so my job is to find how their dreams connect with the companys dreams and whats your dream make life better for me my family and my community i seek to be impactful and valuable to change the world do you feel like you are doing that here at atc building towers yes i am our purpose is to build a more connected africa towers connect people by enabling them to communicate well most misunderstandings come from people not being able to communicate did you always want to be in finance no i didn’t know about finance until later when i was in high school my late father invited somebody to have a chat with me a guy who had excelled in his high school and was then in university the talk was not more than five minutes he talked about cpa certified public accountant a lot he said it was something i could do as i waited to go to university i was sold on the idea i then eagerly waited for kca to announce applications in the newspapers i would bother the principal st marys yala for the newspaper every week to check if the call was out that’s how i came across strathmore in the newspaper and applied and eventually enrolled so if this fellow was a doctor do you think you would have been influenced to study medicine yes definitely however in high school i was good at electricity and my dream was to be an electrical engineer but this guy came earlier before that could happen chuckle america tower corporation kenya ceo george odenyo during the interview on june 24 2024 at his office in nairobi photo credit billy ogada nation media group is there a chance that you might still pursue that love no im in that environment either way i have so many engineers here so i still enjoy what i do because of that in hindsight i think theres a reason why things happen the way they happen i have no regrets have you had conversations with yourself about what your purpose is and why you are here are you here to build masts i think we are in this world to create an impact to make a difference i believe that helping others is integral to our purpose i have benefited from the generosity of others in my entire journey some of whom were not even my relatives so i’m also doing the same it makes me happy to see others excel my earlier years were instrumental in shaping who i have become by the time i was joining the university of nairobi i was already done with part two of my cpa which allowed me to get an internship that eventually turned into a job against the wishes of my parents and the advice of other people close to me i decided to drop out of university i completed my cpa later at catholic university i also did a bachelor of commerce at the same university i have worked and learned not the other way around how old are you i’m 45 now i was born in pumwani but my dad moved to the village when i was five or so years old its a place called ugunja in nyanza you might know it i struggled academically in my earlier years until around class six when i met a teacher who changed how i viewed academics and helped me excel i’m the only son in a family of three girls and that didn’t help in those years when i was not performing well because my mom was on my case what was the impact of growing up in a family of girls as the only boy quite interesting you learn a lot about women without realising it but also perhaps that made me more empathetic to women i wasn’t spared from chores because i was the only boy in fact sometimes i was made to do a little more my dad believed in me unfortunately he died when i was 25 years old who filled the role of a father for you after he died when he died i became the father in the family my mom handed everything over to me she died two years ago do you have children i have three an 18 a 17 and a 10yearold a boy and two girls this is a plaque they gifted me for father’s day can you believe you have a 18yearold laughs yes i can its because i started so early i started working at 21 and that changed my life because when money started coming in my old man to ensure i did not get lost encouraged me to find a wife and settle down so at 25 i was already married and i started a family immediately what bits of fatherhood do you find very challenging because i grew up in a different time it’s challenging to appreciate the circumstances that our children are growing up in now it’s often difficult to relate to them and their situation everything is different and sometimes you want your child to see things your way but they can’t you have to accept that it is their life and love them you cannot control their lives but i try as much as possible to make sure that i pass the right baton to them do you think youre successful as a father no as a man who lives and works i dont talk about success i talk about being valuable am i valuable yes for sure i believe that as long as you are valuable out here in the community in society and in the family then success will follow you how do you know for certain that youre valuable because of what youre able to give you are valuable because of what you are giving at work at home and in your community i believe that as long as you are growing over time you become valuable you become valuable by the knowledge that you can share and by the guidance you can give and that way success can follow you in this season what are some of the most difficult things you are experiencing in this season as a man things are moving so fast and i wonder if i will achieve everything i have set out to achieve but other than that i think its a beautiful time to be alive to be a father to be a leader to be living and doing things that need to be done when your son gets to the age where he says i found a wife what are the top three pieces of

2024 spooked by high production costs and a recent barrage of tax measures dealing a blow to prospects of generating quality jobs in the economy data by the kenya national bureau of standards kebs show that the sector grew by 13 percent in the quarter to march compared to 17 percent a year prior the slowest pace since the same quarter of 2008 when it grew by a paltry 07 percent amid deadly violence and economic disruption caused by the disputed outcome of the 2007 presidential election “growth in the manufacture of food products was constrained by a 65 percent decline in soft drink production during the quarter under review in the manufacture of nonfood products cement production declined from 23 million tonnes in the same quarter of 2023 to 21 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2024” knbs stated in its gdp report for the first three months of 2024 the poor growth performance leaves the sector which has the highest multiplier effect on the economy on the ropes despite being touted as a key pillar of the kenya kwanza administration which sees industry driving the next phase of kenya’s economic transformation the slump in manufacturing puts a damper on the governments ambitions of raising the sector’s contribution to gdp to 20 percent by 2030 as productivity falls local manufacturers who are members of the kenya association of manufacturers kam have set the same target under their ‘20by30’ agenda the share of manufacturing to kenya’s gdp stood at 76 percent in 2023 in contrast to a high of 10 percent in 2014 the sector also contributed just 9700 of the 848100 new jobs created in the economy in 2023 or 114 percent industrialists cite a recent wave of punitive tax measures and high costs of production for the dismal performance in the sector for example the export and promotion levy introduced through the finance act 2023 set a tax of 175 percent of the customs value of imported cement clinkers and other manufacturingrelated products such as bars and rods impacting the cost of finished products from local manufacturers only bamburi cement mombasa cement and simba cement manufacture clinker locally according to kam highlighting constrained productivity by other cement makers on higher input costs “because of that constrained production the capacity to manufacture cement has gone down while the cost of a bag of cement has risen from lows of sh560 to upwards of sh850 in some places this has impacted other sectors such as construction and real estate” noted kam ceo anthony mwangi the new taxes have exacerbated the struggles of a sector already bogged down by high production costs including that of imports and electricity costly energy is being blamed on inefficiencies in generation transmission and distribution mr mwangi said manufacturing has been shaken on both the demand and supply side inhibiting gains for sector expected to carry the multiplier effect in the economy including job creation “we operate in an ecosystem and just looking at the overall economic environment you look at interest rates going up so has the cost of living which has hit the demand for manufactured products by consumers on the supply side we face high input costs including energy taxes and regulatory levies paid to entities such as kebs kenya bureau of standards and nema national environment management authority alongside the cost and tenure of credit everywhere you turn costs come at you” he added the problems bedevilling manufacturing according to kam include trade in counterfeit products transport and storage issues and weak access to credit financing under its bottomup economic transformation agenda beta president william ruto identified key value chains including leather textiles dairy edible oils building and construction materials as important in efforts to boost manufacturing’s share of gdp key allocations to the sector in the fiscal year ended june 30 included sh47 billion for the establishment of countyintegrated agroindustrial parks and sh550 million for the completion of the naivasha special economic zone sez and the construction of dongo kundu sez a further sh28 billion was set aside for the development of the athi river textile hub and sh3 billion for six epz flagship hubs in january the government revealed it would be putting up 30 additional county aggregation and industrial parks lifting the number from an initial 18 the push for new manufacturing infrastructure has come against the continued erosion of existing factories as industrial areas now face encroachment from

reminder of what happens when everyone in the world wants to see the same movie” says gaydos “there is pent up demand that lands on the same square the same day it’s beyond marketing beyond

last month admitted to muted hopes and minimal fingernails should the sequel sink at the cinema he said “we’re going to have to think even more radically about how we run our business” the problem docter identified was a pandemic hangover pixar’s decision to release two key titles soul and elemental straight to streaming had likely habituated audiences to seeing such films on their own sofas

marvel or barbie nineteen per cent of its opening weekend audience were aged between 25 and 34 and 18 were between 18 and 24 it seems adults aren’t only willing and eager to take the children – they’re willing and eager to go without them more surprisingly this also appears to be the case with despicable me 4 exit figures from its first day of us release suggest 59 of the audience were over 18 with a further 20 aged 1317 “what we’re finding” says meledandri “is that there’s a very strong nostalgia factor which means it’s actually playing across all ages” audiences’ responses also more closely mirror those towards “a fullblown comedy” says meledandri than traditional family fare “and comedy in theatrical films is becoming more and more rare” even rarer is mainstream comedy that translates across international territories – something at which the film’s spanglishjabbering minion characters “languageagonistic” says meledandri are old pros “every part of the world can really lay claim to them in a primary manner” says meledandri “and have the exact same enjoyment” both films also boast a significant female skew inside out 2 features almost no male characters while gru’s focus remains on protecting the three orphan girls he has adopted and both are buoyed by having a nimble us improv star fronting their promotional drive steve carell who voices gru in the case of despicable me 4 and for inside out 2 amy poehler who voices joy “they both have incredible comedy chops but also huge hearts” says lefauve “amy is inseparable from joy so it’s wonderful from a marketing perspective that she really seems to walk out of the screen” yet the business model behind the two series diverges dramatically meledandri founded illumination in 2007 when “a consistency of boxoffice success” for market leaders dreamworks disney and pixar meant “the pressure wasn’t really there on cost containment” his strategy put sustainability at the centre – with rapid returns the despicable me series is now the topgrossing animated franchise of all time with boxoffice takings of almost 5bn £39bn profit margins are widened by budget consistency the first despicable me cost 69m

belttightening says gaydos “right now anyone who is in the animation field must be feeling really good these look like good bets to people who invest in a big way with family movies” and the key word

that side of the economy driving the investing environment in the uk is weak and banks are off the pitch for a lot of small and mediumsized businesses the stock market is weak in terms of valuations and the amount of money flowing into things i think with her economist background she seems to have a good plan for that labour have said they will look at business rates and all retailers are looking at that with some hope i think they know it’s a distorted tax in sense that it is old and out of date and needs adjustment to create a level playing field on workers’ rights we employ a lot of people at the lower end of the pay scale and for them to be a bit betteroff is good what we don’t want to do is affect the competitivity of business and labour have tried to reassure on that i am hoping the reforms will be sensible and not drag on any of the good things in the economy like flexibility phil urban ceo of pubs and restaurants group mitchells butlers view image in fullscreen phil urban all changes of government bring opportunities and challenges that businesses have to take advantage of or overcome at mb we have not spent much time overthinking what a labour government will mean other than looking at their manifesto we will cross the bridges as they arise and seek out how to optimise all the changes they make in terms of hopes we would like to think they will recognise the value of the hospitality sector and recognise that if they give us a break through business rates reform a reduction in employer national insurance contributions speed up the planning process and ideally bring vat in line with europe then the sector will thrive investing as it does so and creating jobs getting some stability and certainty can only help so settling the election early has been a positive outcome paul thwaite ceo of natwest group view image in fullscreen paul thwaite growing our economy to help increase prosperity and raise the living standards of people across the uk is rightly a priority for our new government the financial services sector will be a crucial partner if we are to achieve this shared ambition we welcome the government’s commitment to work with the private sector through longterm policies such as the national wealth fund and a modern industrial strategy to support our economy we also need a competitive banking sector we have a strong track record of high regulatory standards and consumer protections and this must continue however i believe there are practical reforms in areas like fraud competitiveness and regulation that would better enable banks to support customers and promote investment i look forward to working with the government and across industries to make meaningful progress on critical issues that will help to create jobs and prosperity

from government jobs of the 13600 increase in private payrolls health care and social assistance accounted for 82000 of those additional jobs that suggests cyclical employment increased by only around 50000 adding to the evidence of weakness in gdp growth he said admittedly the rise in the unemployment rate to 41 from 40 was for the “right” reasons with a 277000 increase in the labour force eclipsing a muted 116000 increase in the household survey measure of employment that means we’re getting closer to triggering the socalled sahm rule although since the rate is being driven up mainly

will define the gold trend after the sharp rise on wednesday the gold xau price declined by 003 on thursday and consolidated within the 2350–2360 range traders are eagerly awaiting the release of the us nonfarm payroll report today at 1230 pm utc which will be a key factor in the federal reserve fed decision regarding potential interest rate cuts us economic data over the past couple of weeks have significantly increased hopes for a rate reduction as early as september and many investors expect todays report to support this outlook based on these anticipations xauusd started to move upwards confidently gold has been rising throughout the week benefiting from weak us macroeconomic data if todays employment data confirms a slowdown in the us economy expectations for a rate cut in september could exceed 80 potentially pushing the price of gold towards 2400 currently traders are pricing in about a 73 chance of a rate cut in september according to the cme fedwatch tool is consolidating and seems ready to rise the pair may break above 2400 and possibly rise towards 2450 however according to the minutes of the last fed meeting officials decided to avoid premature conclusions and seek more data additional bullish impetus for gold could come from geopolitical risks particularly the situation in the middle east the conflict between israel and hamas has somewhat cooled but is yet to be resolved as reported by reuters israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu told us president joe biden on thursday he has decided to send a delegation to resume stalled negotiations on a hostage release deal with hamas their administrations said today traders should prepare for increased volatility the nfp report will come out at 1230 pm utc and define the xauusd trend movement if the employment data reveals a softening labor market the pair could rise towards 2380–2390 otherwise the price may drop towards the support level of 2350 the euro continues rising while traders await the nfp data the euro eur gained 022 during a relatively quiet trading session on thursday continuing the bullish impulse triggered by disappointing us data on wednesday has been rising since 26 june as some uncertainty surrounding the french elections has dissipated while the critical us data generally were weaker than expected weakening the usd moreover the latest eurozone core inflation figures came out higher than expected the inflation pace has raised doubt about whether the european central bank ecb can deliver two rate cuts this year as the market hoped it would interest rate swap market data now implies that the federal reserve fed may be more dovish than the ecb for the rest of the year traders currently price in roughly 49 basis points bps worth of rate cuts by the fed until middecember but expect just 40 bps of cuts by the ecb this divergence in monetary policy expectations may continue to exert bullish pressure on eurusd in the short term eurusd was essentially unchanged during the asian and early european trading sessions today all eyes will be on the us nonfarm payroll nfp report due at 1230 pm utc the previous nfp data indicated that the us economy added 272000 jobs in may significantly exceeding expectations of 185000 one of the largest monthly gains in the last five months this time the market anticipates an additional 190000 jobs created in june which is relatively easy to exceed if the upcoming data surpasses market expectations it will support the us dollar and reduce the likelihood of the us interest rate reduction in september thus eurusd will correct downwards possibly below 107900 weak nfp data may put strong bearish pressure on the greenback and pull eurusd upwards above 108500 etf liquidations trigger a selloff in bitcoin s btc

the 70000 level several times some investors decided to exit the market temporarily over the past four weeks btcusd has lost some 14 in value mostly due to cryptospecific factors such as investors

monday july 1 ’24 dr david kelly jpmorgan’s chief global strategist started off the call with the remark that ultimately “all systems break down” david was quoting or paraphrasing one of the jpmorgan analysts who had an engineering background by education with the analyst using the word “entropy” in one of her missives in physics the word entropy’s 2nd level definition is “a gradual decline into disorder” which we can loosely interpret as “all systems break down” now this is no way was a market call on dr kelly’s part personally i thought it was a good intro into a discussion about the economy and the markets today both of which are seemingly in pretty good shape but is a polite and disarming way to say that – in essence – all bull markets and good economies come to an end david

and one aspect of what some might call postmortem analysis was to try and identify factors other than the constant parade of overvaluation calls for the and the between 1995 and march 2000 that were in evidence and there were many on a daily and weekly basis and the “annual return” or annualized return data for the sp 500 and the nasdaq was definitely flashing red the sp 500’s annual return alone for the period from 1995 to 1999 was 28 a year think about that and that doesn’t include the period from january 1 ‘2000 to midmarch 2000 the nasdaq alone doubled from september ’99 to march 2000 a period of just 6 months the problem with the 1990s was that stock market returns were “binary” becoming similar to today you were either largely a growth investor and kept up with the sp 500 or – as an investment advisor or hedgefund manager – you were largely valued and underperformed dramatically for 5 12 years value investing back then and value was defined as below 1x pricetobook under 10x pe etc was largely commodity stock investing and smallcap driven as – just like today – smallcap equalweight value and international remain completely outoffavor the other aspect of this not always well understood is that in every bull market there is a ” generational difference” around investing my first analyst job at a mutual fund firm was from 1992 to 1995 and the first day i started i saw a terminal device on my desk it looked like a small tv after i had been working with pcs and spreadsheet software for several years already because this firm had been in existence since the late 1940s and had managed money for many iconic american families the older portfolio managers both the standalone guys who were more similar to brokers and the mutual fund managers seemed very leery of the personal computer and technology in general the research department was quickly given pcs and spreadsheet software many wanted to stay with the device tied to the mainframe even though ibm nyse was blowing up and dropping from its high of 175 preoctober 1987 crash to the early 90’s 50 share price a lot of older investors men and women as women were starting to manage mutual funds at that time

article released on linkedin on july 2nd 2024 ed raises a good point about the semiconductor cycle ie it’s still a cycle and also questions some of jensen huang’s and sam altman’s prognostications in my words the hyperbole is really flowing tom lee in my opinion one of the best market prognosticators in the last 5 – 10 years came out this past week and said he thought the sp 500 could get to 15000 or triple by the year 2030 that is pretty ambitious if it wasn’t tom lee the forecast probably wouldn’t have gotten the media attention it did just an average correction of 10 – 15 for the sp 500 would go a long way to restore the “wall of worry” to investing the sp 500 could use a good flush none of this is advice or a recommendation but only an opinion which should be taken with considerable skepticism past performance is no guarantee of future results investing can involve the loss of principal even for short periods of time all return data courtesy of ycharts thanks for

A0288,2024-07-05,311,New PM Starmer pledges to rebuild Britain after years of chaos By Reuters,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/new-pm-starmer-pledges-action-not-words-to-fix-britain-3509058,by kylie maclellan william james and sarah young london reuters britains new prime minister keir starmer pledged on friday to use his massive electoral majority to rebuild the country saying he wanted to take the heat out of politics after years of upheaval and strife standing outside his new office and residence at number 10 downing street starmer acknowledged the scale of the challenge after his partys landslide victory in a parliamentary election ended 14 years of often tumultuous conservative government he warned that any improvements would take time and he would need to first rebuild faith in politics this lack of trust can only be healed by actions not words i know that he said whether you voted labour or not in fact especially if you did not i say to you directly my government will serve you politics can be a force for good we will show that starmer was greeted by huge cheers and took time before making his speech to shake hands with and hug aides and wellwishers who lined downing street scenes that were reminiscent of labour predecessor tony blairs arrival in government in 1997 standing behind a lectern he said he understood that many britons were disillusioned with politics after years of scandal and chaos under the conservatives who were roundly rejected in thursdays election suffering a historic loss starmer said the rejection signalled that britain was ready for a reset because no matter how fierce the storms of history one of the great strengths of this nation has always been our ability to navigate away to calmer waters massive majority the centreleft labour won a massive majority in the 650seat parliament prompting rishi sunaks resignation on friday morning before starmer went to meet king charles and be formally named prime minister he said he would fight every day to rebuild trust saying britain would have a government unburdened by doctrine underlining something he had repeated during the campaign that he would put country first party second to defy quietly those who have written our country off you have given us a clear mandate and we will use it to deliver change the election result has upended british politics labour won more than 410 seats an increase of 211 while the conservatives the western worlds most successful party lost 250 lawmakers including a record number of senior ministers and former prime minister liz truss sunaks conservatives suffered the worst performance in the partys long history as voters punished them for a cost of living crisis failing public services and a series of scandals to the country i would like to say first and foremost i am sorry sunak said outside downing street adding he would stay as conservative leader until the party was ready to appoint his replacement i have given this job my all but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the united kingdom must change and yours is the only judgment that matters i have heard your anger your disappointment and i take responsibility for this loss tough road ahead despite starmers convincing victory polls suggested there was little enthusiasm for starmer or his party thanks to the quirk of britains firstpastthepost system and a low turnout labours triumph was achieved with fewer votes than it secured in 2017 and 2019 the latter its worst result in terms of seats won for 84 years the pound and british stocks and government bonds rose marginally on friday but starmer comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges britains tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after world war two net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output living standards have fallen and public services are creaking especially the much cherished national health service which has been dogged by strikes some of labours more ambitious plans such as its flagship green spending pledges have already been scaled back while starmer has promised not to raise taxes for working people likewise he has promised to scrap the conservatives policy of sending asylum seekers to rwanda but with migration a key electoral issue he will be under pressure himself to find a way to stop tens of thousands of people arriving across the channel from france on small boats i dont promise you it will be easy starmer said earlier at a victory rally changing a country is not like flicking a switch its hard work patient determined work and we will have to get moving immediately his first appointments to his top team of ministers contained no surprises rachel reeves was named as britains first female finance minister angela rayner was made deputy prime minister and david lammy was appointed foreign minister all keeping the policy briefs they had held in opposition britains election result showed growth in support for the rightwing reform party led by nigel farage echoing recent similar results in europe where the farright have been surging but unlike france where marine le pens national rally party made historic gains in an election last sunday overall the british public has plumped for a centreleft party to bring about change starmer has promised to improve relations with the european union after brexit but labour has said rejoining the eu was not on the table he may also have to work with trump if he wins novembers presidential election trump has already sent congratulations to farage via his social media platform truth social while he has promised to bring change domestically starmer has vowed to continue londons unequivocal support for ukraine in its war against russia on many foreign issues his policies are similar to sunaks the election victory represents an incredible turnaround for starmer and labour which critics and supporters said was facing an existential crisis just three years ago when it appeared to have lost its way after its 2019 drubbing,,,,,,,,Very Old

more we are sticking with our sell rating southwest has taken steps to defend itself on wednesday the airline adopted a socalled poison pill that would activate if any shareholder acquired an interest of more than 125 limiting elliotts ability to attain more control elliott says it currently has an interest of about 11 of the company despite the potential wrinkle introduced by southwests latest move history offers some clues as to how this will play out several activism experts pointed to two of elliotts past targets for insight into the hedge funds strategy for southwest suncor energy in 2022 and marathon petroleum in 2019 elliott partner john pike who is now leading the southwest campaign was involved in the firms actions at both energy companies while suncor and marathon resisted elliotts proposals including leadership change and business reviews elliott still got much of what it wanted watch now elliotts activist practice has helped it become one of the most successful hedge funds in the world surpassing 65 billion in assets the firm which moved its headquarters in 2020 from new york to west palm beach florida has only had two losing years in five decades it often pushes companies to make dramatic changes such as selling off businesses firing executives or abandoning strategic plans in recent years however elliott has also shown it can work collaboratively with management representatives have joined the boards of companies including pinterest and etsy texas instruments ceo haviv ilan said in may that his company was open to constructive dialogue with elliott and salesforce ceo marc benioff said he had thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the elliott team after the firm dropped plans to nominate directors at the software company in 2023 southwest said in a brief response to elliotts presentation that its thoughtfully reviewing the june 10 letter from the hedge fund and looks forward to further conversations with elliott southwest also said its confident in its strategy and its team and is focused on restoring our industryleading financial performance jordan said he has no plans to resign pike and portfolio manager bobby xu are leading elliotts southwest campaign elliott and southwest representatives met in person in dallas two weeks ago according to people familiar with the matter the discussions remain in the early stages said the people who asked not to be named because the conversations were private the airline has tapped bank of america and law firm vinson elkins to advise it another person familiar with the situation said southwest shares are down slightly since elliott announced its involvement despite a 7 jump on the day of the disclosure they fell 57 on friday to close at 2694 southwest did not provide a comment for this story a sprint and marathon watch now in april 2022 when elliott revealed a stake in suncor it pointed to a culture that had become overly bureaucratic leading to an operational slump and a string of worker deaths under ceo mark little we have considerable respect for suncor elliotts pike wrote in calling for management review investors were initially wary of elliotts demands which included selling off suncors petrocanada gas stations little pushed back initially but his boardroom support evaporated when another worker was killed weeks after elliott announced its stake little resigned and the canadian company soon struck a deal with elliott offering three board seats to the hedge fund and conceding to a strategic review — meaning a potential sale — of its petrocanada gas stations it was a middleoftheroad resolution the company decided after the review not to sell its petrocanada business but it also brought in as ceo an outsider in longtime exxon mobil executive rich kruger at southwest elliott sees a top job that would be similarly appealing to industry executives from other airlines according to a person familiar with the firms thinking a suncor energy facility in sherwood park alberta canada aug 21 2019 candace elliott reuters while its suncor effort ended in a relatively quick victory elliotts experience with marathon highlighted the firms willingness to be patient elliott first amassed a stake in the oil producer in 2016 and asked marathon to evaluate breaking up the company like suncor marathon ran a review and opted to stay intact keeping its speedway gas stations as part of the business but in 2018 a few months after reaching an agreement with elliott marathon announced it was only getting bigger the company agreed to buy rival andeavor in a 23 billion deal elliott responded to what it viewed as a broken promise by reviving its activist campaign in 2019 picking up a new 25 position and proclaiming that it would make sure the right leadership was in place while the company assured shareholders that it was pursuing a full review of the speedway business it had a different agenda entirely elliotts pike wrote in the 2019 letter weeks later marathons board said ceo gary heminger would retire and that the company would finally spin off speedway elliott reportedly insisted the board find an outsider to replace heminger in march 2020 marathon hired 38year industry veteran mike hennigan as ceo speedway was sold to 7elevens parent company for 21 billion in 2020 months after hennigan took the post and the company later announced a 71 billion buyback program years after its victories at marathon and suncor elliott remains a top five shareholder at both companies watch now elliott is now one of the top investors in southwest one major shareholder artisan partners has expressed its support for elliotts campaign southwests bylaws allow big shareholders to call a special meeting to replace its board something elliott could consider doing further down the road though the firm hasnt said if it plans to mount a proxy fight whether or not shareholders decide to back elliotts push history shows they will benefit elliotttargeted companies tend to outperform the market according to a 13d monitor analysis the hedge fund holds on to its positions for two years on average according to the data elliott said its plan can help southwests share price jump 77 in 12 months to 49 the poison pill southwest introduced this week could complicate matters its normally adopted by companies fending off a takeover bid in this case it limits elliotts ability to amass more control and also suggests that southwests management isnt interested in rolling over in the press release announcing the plan kelly said the airline remains open to any ideas for lasting value creation but said adopting the poison pill was part of the boards fiduciary duties to all shareholders the measure would allow all shareholders other than the person or group triggering the plan to buy stock at a 50 discount to the market price if any person or group acquired 125 or more of the companys outstanding stock elliott which has dealt with poison pills in the past hasnt made clear where it plans to go with its campaign the firm isnt currently pursuing specific changes that would affect things such as southwests baggage policy according to a person familiar with its plans southwest is the only domestic carrier that allows every passenger to check two bags for free a major customer perk particularly for those who fly with family members but a refreshed board and business review could lead to scrutiny of some of southwests popular offerings union challenges there are some key differentiating factors for southwest when compared with suncor and marathon for one southwest hasnt made a notable acquisition since 2011 and doesnt have any adjacent businesses to spin out another potential hurdle is union influence which makes it harder for management to implement significant changes particularly when they involve layoffs and other cost cuts more than 80 of southwests employees belong to a union and there are separate organizations for pilots flight attendants and mechanics in all workers are represented by at least 11 unions according to the airlines website leadership from the 11000member southwest airlines pilots association met with the elliott team in dallas in june the group conducted an indepth analysis on elliotts actionable plans and timelines labor leaders said in a message obtained by cnbc in very simple terms this has the potential to be one of the most significant events in southwest airlines history swapa leaders wrote of the activist campaign southwest has previously acknowledged some of the problems elliott highlighted including system failures that led to thousands of cancellations and left millions of passengers stranded during the 2022 winter holidays but financial challenges persist last week southwest cut its secondquarter revenue forecast the company cited complexities in adapting its business to current booking patterns in this dynamic environment according to elliott its all part of a pattern that justifies activist intervention southwest is led by a team that has proven unable to adapt to the modern airline industry pike and xu said in a statement this is yet another example that fundamental leadership change is urgently needed at southwest — cnbcs leslie josephs contributed to this report,,,,,,,,Very Old

amel 34 told cnbc ahead of the final round of voting in frances snap election this weekend the vote is being closely watched by all quarters of french society to see if the nationalist antiimmigration national rally rn builds on its initial win in the first round of voting or whether centrist and leftwing parties have been able to thwart the partys chances of entering government its a very very tense time and its the first time that the far right is winning at the first turn the first round of the ballot so its a very big deal amel a therapist who said she will vote for the leftwing new popular front added we are very anxious and we are trying to get everyone to vote trying to tell people who dont vote to go and vote and to try to convince people who vote for the extreme right that they are not a good answer to frances problems frances farright rn rejects the extremist label saying it stands up for french values culture and citizens at a time when many are fed up with frances political establishment thats been led by president emmanuel macron since 2017 but rns opponents and critics warn france is on the brink of a political catastrophe if an overtly antiimmigration nationalist and euroskeptic party wins a majority in this snap election called by macron after his party lost heavily against the hardright in european parliament elections in june prime minister gabriel attal has said french voters now have a moral duty to halt the partys advance for young leftleaning voters like amel rns surge in voter polls and the fact it won the most votes in the first round of the election last weekend are worrying developments that make them fear for frances societal cohesion watch now i am worried about the countrys future i think its getting worse and worse amel who preferred to only give her first name due to the sensitive nature of the situation said its going be like a kind of civil war i hope it will not reach that but people will just not mix anymore and will be scared of each other and this is very scary the snap election has thrown the countrys political polarization into sharp relief as polls ahead of the final round of voting on sunday imply a deeply divided nation the first round of the election resulted in the farright rn winning 33 of the vote with the leftwing new popular front nfp garnering 28 and the coalition of parties supporting macron ensemble or together winning 20 of the vote left wing supporters react as the results of the first round of french parliamentary elections are announced in nantes western france on june 30 2024 sebastien salomgomis afp getty images since the results of the first ballot parties on the centerright and left have gone allout to prevent rns advance in the second ballot aiming to prevent a parliamentary majority for the party at all costs joining forces in a socalled republican front centrists and leftwing parties have withdrawn candidates in many constituencies where one of their candidates was better placed to beat the rn by offering voters a starker choice and fewer options the anti farright front hopes that the electorate will vote for the nonrn candidate whether it will work remains to be seen and analysts point out that french voters might not take kindly to being directed how to vote or who to vote for the elections are a mess the final result on sunday evening — the outcome of a snap election macron did not need to call — will show just how hard it could be to find a consensus in national politics and government going forward how the nation will react to the result is also uncertain france is no stranger to civil unrest given the widespread yellow vest antigovernment movement of recent years and street protests since the first round of voting on june 30 frances interior ministry appears to be preparing for more trouble after sundays poll reportedly ready to deploy around 30000 officers across france on sunday night amid fears of violence after polls

of early general elections in paris france on june 30 2024 anadolu anadolu getty images a member of the gendarmerie frances military force in charge of law enforcement and public order told cnbc that the french elections are a mess and that the public divide has rarely been so flagrant in france peoples opinions are becoming more and more divided and this is felt in everyday life the gendarme who asked to remain anonymous due to the nature of his job told cnbc the officer — a father of three whos in his 40s and a rightleaning voter — said the polarization in french society was very worrying but unfortunately normal with the diversity of our society more and more people with different values and educations are being forced to coexist and this clearly doesnt work the officer who works in bordeaux in southwestern france said i am worried about the countrys future because we are too generous to people who arent willing to integrate and contribute to our society this can not last the police officer said he expected civil unrest after the vote whichever party gained the most votes there will be civil unrest whoever is elected this is france and the people speak their mind civil unrest possible political experts agree that the current febrile atmosphere of french politics and antagonism between the main bodies of voters are the ingredients for further civil unrest youve got here all the recipe for a superpolarized political scene and that of course translates into civil society as a whole philippe marlière professor of french and european politics at university college london told cnbc if youve got only 3334 of people voting for the farright it means the rest is wary of that or completely opposed to it so that will translate on every level of politics — institutional politics party politics the national assembly but also in society you will have a very polarized society in which younger people ethnic minorities women and in particular feminists would be very worried he said marlière did not discount the possibility of violence on the streets if a farright party was elected to government were not there yet but if there are very unpopular very antagonizing and very hostile policies to some groups there will be demonstrations on a scale that you have unrest in the street he said unknown entity like other hardright parties in europe the national rally has tapped into voter insecurities regarding crime immigration national identity and economic insecurity rns 28yearold leader jordan bardella has told voters he will restore order curb immigration and tackle delinquency but he and party figurehead marine le pen have rowed back on some of their more strident promises and rhetoric backpedaling over taking france out of nato for example and moderating the partys traditionally prorussian stance bardella said he would still support the sending of arms to ukraine but not the deployment of ground troops as macron suggested was a

its uncertain how many of national rallys policies would be enacted even if the party made it into government the republican front also appears confident ahead of the second round of voting that its strategy to hurt the rns vote share is working an opinion poll published by ifop on july 3 suggested voters might tend toward a centrist promacron or leftwing candidate rather than the rn candidate if that is the choice they are presented with on the ballot paper on sunday if the choice was between a farleft and farright candidate however the picture was more nuanced showing a split vote watch

key data on consumer and wholesale inflation economic data the june consumer price index cpi is out on thursday morning and the june producer price index ppi is out on friday morning of the two cpi carries more weight given that it more closely represents what consumers are paying for a basket of goods from one year or month to the next which is the feds main concern however ppi is important to track because it tells us what is happening at the cost input level for corporations that speaks to margin dynamics – and therefore it can inform us on both profitability and potential price actions companies may need to take in the future to protect profitability within the cpi data be sure to watch the shelter component which has been a huge thorn in the feds side shelter a barometer of what people pay for housing has proven a very sticky source of inflation – a problem because for most americans it represents a large and unavoidable cost for headline cpi economists are looking for a 31 annual increase according to factset as of friday core cpi which excludes food and energy prices is expected to increase 35 year over year if realized that would represent a slight deceleration at the headline level but a slight acceleration at the core level as for ppi economists are looking for a 23 annual increase at the headline level and a 25 yearoveryear rise at the core level those numbers would be slightly higher than what we saw in may earnings season within the portfolio net interest income nii guidance is going to be a key watch item when wells fargo reports its quarter this coming

biden speaks during a campaign event in madison wisconsin on july 5 2024 saul loeb afp getty images president joe biden insisted friday that his damaging debate performance against former president donald trump was just a bad night and not an indication of a more serious health condition i was exhausted biden told abc news george stephanopoulos in his first facetoface tv interview since his raspy and disconnected debate last week i didnt listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and had a bad night said biden who also referred to his performance as a bad episode when stephanopoulos noted that biden had returned from an overseas foreign policy trip in europe about 11 days before the debate and spent six days at camp david beforehand biden replied i was sick i was feeling terrible asked if he watched the debate later biden briefly paused and then said i dont think i did no he said repeatedly that his performance was nobodys fault but mine biden also refused to entertain the idea of taking a cognitive or neurological test i get a full neurological test every day biden said referring to the rigors of the presidency when stephanopoulos pressed him on why he hadnt taken had any cognitive assessments the president replied no no one said i had to the interview came on the same day that biden defiantly rejected a growing chorus of democrats including top donors and allies who are urging the 81yearold incumbent to withdraw from the race biden under aggressive questioning from stephanopoulos about whether he is capable of either beating trump in november or serving another four years in the white house maintained that he believes he is up to both tasks im running again because i think i understand best what has to be done biden said in the 23minute interview he appeared to foreclose any possibility of changing his mind even in a scenario where party leaders and his close allies ask him to step aside i mean if the lord almighty came down and said joe get out of the race id get out of the race he said the lord almightys not coming down biden said he has spoken since the debate with democratic leaders who did not tell him to withdraw but many democratic lawmakers are still considering their next steps house minority leader hakeem jeffries dny is holding a virtual meeting sunday with the top democrats on house committees three sources told nbc news the group is expected to focus on biden one of those sources told nbc less than a halfdozen house democrats so far have called on biden to drop out of the race so far but that number could grow over the weekend the presidents remarks to stephanopoulos echoed his earlier comments on the campaign trail that day i am running and going to win again biden told a crowd of supporters during a speech in madison wisconsin theyre trying to push me out of the race biden told the crowd well let me say this as clearly as i can im staying in the race biden told reporters on an airport tarmac after the campaign event that he had spoken to at least 20 members of congress who are telling me to stay in the race bidens decision could set the campaign on a path of increasing tension with some of its top allies and donors who spurred by concerns about bidens health and abilities have called for a new nominee to lead the democratic party into the november elections while biden sounded consistently louder and clearer in fridays remarks and interview than he did in last weeks debate he still occasionally slurred or fumbled over certain words and phrases frustration mounts among dems on capitol hill democratic sen mark warner of virginia a longtime biden ally has launched a new effort to convene democratic senators next week to discuss what bidens path forward might be nbc news reported asked on the tarmac about warners effort the president dismissed it warner he said is the only one considering that no one else has called me to do that on thursday disney heiress and longtime democratic donor abigail disney told cnbc that she will withhold donations until biden withdraws on wednesday a group of business leaders corralled by the prodemocracy leadership now project urged biden to step aside editorial boards of multiple newspapers including the new york times have issued the same call questions are now swirling about how an alternative candidate such as vice president kamala harris might take bidens place as the new nominee the trump campaign and republican party in turn have started ramping up attacks on harris harris told cbs news on tuesday joe biden is our nominee we beat trump once and were going to beat him again period white house press secretary karine jeanpierre held the line in a gaggle with reporters who peppered her with questions about bidens capabilities during the flight to madison he said he had a bad debate jeanpierre conceded but 90 minutes should not overshadow his career his threeandahalf year tenure as president biden she added is resolute strong and thinking as clearly as he used to but that solid front — buttressed by subsequent statements of support from democratic governors and other allies — has done little to tamp down

A0312,2024-07-06,310,What's Driving the Growing Abstinence Trend Among Young Americans?,CBN,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2024/july/whats-driving-the-growing-abstinence-trend-among-young-americans,it’s tempting to look at the socalled “great abstaining” as the cut put it and think it’s a notch on the belt of those preaching biblical morality in a culture run amok but i don’t think that’s what’s happening unfortunately i think what we’re seeing now — this growing and on its face encouraging trend toward sexual abstinence — is just the flip side of the same counterfeit coin the siren sound of the world of our own fractured morality it’s the same voice that has told us “sex is just sex” “there’s no harm in casual hookups” “what’s the problem if it’s consensual with or without marriage” listen to the latest episode of “quick start” now apparently many are choosing to abstain from sex ironically for what i believe to be the very same reasons they opted to have sex indiscriminately scripture urges abstinence outside of marriage because god calls us to keep the marriage bed “undefiled” hebrews 1346 in the beginning god made clear his design is for man and woman to join together in marriage and become “one flesh” genesis 224 those principles — the spiritual bond solidified by the act of sex — reverberate throughout the biblical narrative the apostle paul urged believers to practice lordship over their bodies and fleshly desires even going so far as to write that to the man who has sex with a prostitute with her he has become “one body” 1 corinthians 61220 sex is a gift from god intended to bring about a beautiful spiritual oneness expressed in the physical world so what’s the issue then with this burgeoning “great abstaining” well it’s rooted not in recognition of just how important and sacred sex is rather it’s just the opposite it seems tethered to the errant belief that there is no real value in sex and its ultimate tangible purpose — procreation people are choosing to opt out of sex because they are rejecting the value of relationship of romance and finally of marriage rather than finding satisfaction in husbandandwife relationships younger americans are choosing themselves over sacrificial love the cut’s kelsey osgood wrote the next generation is “deemphasizing traditional romance” they aren’t just choosing to shun marriage many are actively arguing it’s no longer valuable as for sexuality they are opting to gratify their own urges in the same hedonistic way our broken world has always encouraged just with a new spin this is entirely unsurprising given our culture’s yearslong celebration of socalled “selflove” “the benefits from a period of celibacy are endless because ultimately it’s about selfdevelopment” the independent reported last year the societal shift toward abstinence isn’t moral it’s egotistical porn use for example is soaring for context see this from psychology today xvideos the topranked pornography site had 700000000 more total visits than amazon and 900000000 1100000000 1300000000 1500000000 and 1800000000 more total visits than tiktok openai linkedin netflix and the weather channel respectively then there are those who see abstinence as just the next wave of “sexual liberation” another irony models like julia fox are choosing to forgo sex as a way of “protesting” the overturning of roe v wade the supreme court she seemed to argue recently has — in her view — taken away her rights to abortion as birth control so now she’s going to abstain from sex altogether because it could lead to pregnancy shouldn’t that have been a consideration all along but i digress “i felt like with the overturning of roe v wade if they were gonna take away our rights to our body and our reproductive rights well then this is my way of taking them back” she said “and i feel like more women should really get on that because we hold the power” all of this to say this is so often how satan and our own deceitful hearts work they take a modicum of truth — that abstinence is a good thing — and twist the motives in a sinful direction if there is a silver lining here — and i believe there’s always a gospel opportunity in every cultural conversation — it’s that such a trend could pave the way for fruitful conversations about why in actuality abstinence is good why god designed sexual expression to be enjoyed within certain parameters and how sex is a gift that should be celebrated and is profoundly redemptive when enjoyed within god’s boundaries rather than destructive,,,,,,,,Very Old

A0317,2024-07-06,310,Florida farmers turn to an ancient tree from India as the state’s once-famous citrus industry dries up,Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/06/florida-farmers-tree-india-citrus-industry-climate-proof-agriculture/,an ancient tree from india is now thriving in groves where citrus trees once flourished in florida and could help provide the nation with renewable energy as large parts of the sunshine state’s oncefamous citrus industry have all but dried up over the past two decades because of two fatal diseases greening and citrus canker some farmers are turning to the pongamia tree a climateresilient tree with the potential to produce plantbased proteins and a sustainable biofuel for years pongamia has been used for shade trees producing legumes — little brown beans — that are so bitter wild hogs won’t even eat them but unlike the orange and grapefruit trees that long occupied these rural florida groves northwest of west palm beach pongamia trees don’t need much attention pongamia trees also don’t need fertilizer or pesticides they flourish in drought or rainy conditions and they don’t require teams of workers to pick the beans a machine simply shakes the tiny beans from the branches when they are ready to harvest terviva a san franciscobased company founded in 2010 by naveen sikka then uses its patented process to remove the biopesticides that cause the bitter taste making the beans suitable for food production “florida offers a rare opportunity for both terviva and former citrus farmers the historical decline of the citrus industry has left farmers without a crop that can grow profitably on hundreds of thousands of acres and there needs to be a very scalable replacement very soon” sikka told the associated press “pongamia is the perfect fit” what is the pongamia tree the pongamia is a wild tree native to india southeast asia and australia the legume is now being used to produce several products including panova culinary oil and protein which are featured ingredient in aloha’s kona protein bars the company also makes protein flour the legumes also produce oil that can be used as a biofuel largely for aviation which leaves a very low carbon footprint said ron edwards chairman of terviva’s board of directors and a longtime florida citrus grower turning a wild tree into a domestic one hasn’t been easy edwards said “there are no books to read on it either because no one else has ever done it” he said bees and other pollinators feast on the pongamia’s flowers supporting local biodiversity edwards said an acre of the trees can potentially provide the same amount of oil as four acres of soy beans he added what’s left after the oil is removed from the pongamia bean is “a very highgrade protein that can be used as a substitute in baking and smoothies and all kinds of other plantbased protein products” edwards said “there’s a lot of potential for the food industry and the oil and petroleum industry” why florida “we know pongamia grows well in florida and the end markets for the oil and protein that come from the pongamia beans — biofuel feed and food ingredients — are enormous” sikka said “so farmers can now reduce their costs and more closely align to the leading edge of sustainable farming practices” at a nursery near fort pierce workers skilled in pongamia grafting techniques affix a portion of the mother tree to a pongamia rootstock which ensures the genetics and desired characteristics of the mother tree are perpetuated in all of terviva’s trees pongamia vs citrus citrus had been florida’s premier crop for years until disease caught up with it starting in the 1990s with citrus canker and later greening citrus canker a bacterial disease is not harmful to humans but it causes lesions on the fruit stems and leaves eventually it makes the trees unproductive citrus greening also known as huanglongbing slowly kills trees and degrades the fruit according to the us department of agriculture greening has spread throughout florida since 2005 devastating countless groves and reducing citrus production by 75 the disease has spread to louisiana texas and california hurricane ian caused about 18 billion in damages to florida’s agriculture in september 2023 hitting the citrus industry at the beginning of its growing season disease and climate issues have also affected most of the world’s top citrusproducing countries for example this year’s harvest in brazil — the world’s largest exporter of orange juice — is forecast to be the worst in 36 years because of flooding and drought according to a forecast by fundecitrus a citrus growers’ organization in sao paulo state but climate and disease have little effect on pongamia trees the company’s officials said “it’s just tough a jungletested tree” edwards said “it stands up to a lot of abuse with very little caretaking” pongamia also grows well in hawaii where it now thrives on land previously used for sugarcane what are citrus farmers saying john olson who owns circle o ranch west of fort pierce has replaced his grapefruit groves with 215 acres 8701 hectares of pongamia trees “we went through all the ups and downs of citrus and eventually because of greening abandoned citrus production” olson said “for the most part the citrus industry has died in florida” while the grapefruit grove was modest it was common for a grove that size to be profitable in the 1980s and 1990s olson said edwards said farmers used various sprays to kill the insect that was spreading the disease eventually the cost of taking care of citrus trees became too risky that’s when he decided to go a different route “what attracted me to pongamia was the fact that one it can repurpose fallow land that was citrus and is now lying dormant” he said “from an ecological point of view it’s very attractive because it can replace some of the oils and vegetable proteins that are now being generated by things like palm oil which is environmentally a much more damaging crop” what about biofuel in december 2023 terviva signed an agreement with mitsubishi corporation to provide biofuel feedstock that can be converted into biodiesel renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel “our partnership with mitsubishi is off to a great start” sikka said noting that the company coordinates closely with mitsubishi on tree plantings and product development and sales “terviva’s progress has accelerated thanks to mitsubishi’s expertise and leadership around the globe on all facets of terviva’s business” what food products does pongamia produce the research is ongoing but edwards said they have made really good graham crackers in addition to the table oil and other plantbased protein products including flour and protein bars pongamia offers an alternative to soybean and yellow pea protein “if you don’t want your protein to come from meat” he

current one baldwin is the eldest of six children — five of them actors — from massapequa new york who has lived in new york city for most of his adult life he has an adult daughter ireland baldwin

many of them harvard law graduates from the firm of quinn emanuel urquhart sullivan alex spiro a 41yearold defense attorney who has represented elon musk megan thee stallion and other prominent figures and has become among the most soughtafter lawyers in the country will give aggressive crossexamination to the state’s witnesses the defense will try to show that it is not the job of an actor to make sure real rounds are not in his gun a position strongly supported by baldwin’s union the screen actors guildamerican federation of television and radio artists baldwin said in an interview with abc news and implied in interviews with authorities that he never pulled the revolver’s trigger his lawyers will also attack the gun evidence and the serious damage done to the revolver during an fbi test they say amounted to the destruction of evidence and left the defense no chance to examine it firearms experts for the prosecution who testified at the gutierrezreed trial are returning to the witness stand over objections by baldwin to testify about his handling of the revolver and whether the gun was functioning properly and they may press witnesses over whether hutchins received proper medical treatment between the shooting and the declaration of her death at a hospital the prosecution team santa fe county district attorney mary carmackaltwies appointed kari morrissey as a special prosecutor in the baldwin case in early 2023 after her predecessor stepped down because of conflicts of interest morrissey promptly had the indictment against baldwin dismissed but revived it in january of this year by grand jury both moves came from further examination of the evidence she said morrissey graduated from the university of new mexico and its law school and practiced law in albuquerque for more than 20 years new mexico criminal defense attorney erlinda johnson joined morrissey’s team in april the trial could bring a culture clash between the team of attorneys as fiery hearings and filings have already shown morrissey and spiro in particular have butted heads often — “i’m not going to sit here and be called a liar” — she said during one such moment at a may hearing — and will likely do the same and provide some drama during the proceedings the prosecutors will try to convince jurors that as a producer and the most important person on the set baldwin brought a recklessness to the production and that as an actor he was negligent in handling his gun who’s expected to testify at the alec baldwin trial the crew members inside the small church building who became eyewitnesses to hutchins’ killing will provide the trial’s most essential testimony they include director joel souza who was himself shot and wounded by the bullet from baldwin’s gun and assistant director david halls the film’s assistant director who some said was responsible for the shooting but pleaded no contest to negligent handling of a firearm zac sneesby a crew member who was holding a boom microphone during the rehearsal will testify that he saw baldwin pull the trigger of the revolver prosecutors said in court filings making him potentially the most important witness of all prosecutors also may call gutierrezreed to the stand but marlowe sommer rejected an immunity deal they wanted to give her jurors will hear testimony from firearms experts who allege the revolver was working properly could not have fired without pulling the trigger and baldwin himself can take the stand in his defense but he doesn’t have to his attorneys have not said which he will do where

written ad nauseam but it hasn’t been written by me i’m different it’s not news but because i said it it’s fresh at least that’s what i think when marius van der ham the airfranceklm general manager for east and southern africa nigeria and ghana walks in sixfeetsomething softspoken in a pr move that shows why the suit took the place of the hat once occupied as the badge separating the ambitious executive from lower echelon workers sometimes the suit wears the man sometimes the man wears the suit heres a quick cheat sheet to the man a big table marius loves big tables to laugh bond eat i had been briefed that he is a man of few words slicing the fat off his sentences for lean quick ripostes he is dutch after all who are not known for beating around the bush but it’s the bush that calls marius i can tell because he lights up when he talks about his runs the animals he sees and the terrain oh the terrain “a hill after every other kilometre” he says wiping the expression off his face and i am not sure whether he is elated or dissatisfied what’s that the dutch say “het is zoals het is” it is what it is do you remember your first time on a plane yes in the netherlands we had domestic flights i must have been around five years old i was on a trip with my grandparents about 100km the second time was when i was around 13 the first big trip i went with my family to the united states us did you know you’d get here it was a coincidence opportunistic even i was in college in the netherlands doing my masters thesis and needed an internship my roommate worked at klm and he recommended an internship there and voila here we are what was your biggest culture shock in kenya i have experienced different cultures in my career and wasn’t too worried about it kenyans and the dutch are not so different sometimes perhaps not everybody says things directly here but in general people speak their minds if you were guaranteed success would this still be the career you chose yes i have been lucky in my 12 years at klm i have spent a decade outside france experiencing different people and cultures i have been privileged what’s the one place you’ve gone to that has stayed with you atlanta in the us being brought up as a child in the 90s in western europe american pop culture seemed the coolest place to be i was very excited but it was a bit of a letdown when i experienced it haha but kenya has been great too to live in the vibrancy of nairobi and the nature sceneries just hours outside the city did you pick up any pop culture tendencies in your sojourn in the states it was a bit of a disappointment from my perspective chuckles what makes you you hard questions now eh haha i am an openminded laidback guy not easily stressed looking for pragmatic solutions in daytoday life—both at work and in my private life i try not to worry too much i like to know where we are going but the way to get there is open you seem quite analytical it depends on where you work in the airline i have worked longer in the commercial side of the airline—pricing—and i have enjoyed figuring out how to make the money and how to price the tickets the other side is about safety and procedures to guarantee safe and reliable operations and good customer focus how have you remained spontaneous in your life my family and i like to go out in nature we have two small children and two dogs and on the weekends we settle in and drive to the nairobi national park or outside the city are you a bush or a beach person hmm in the end i’ll have to go with bush who is the dog person between you and your wife we both are i have always had a dog even before i was born we had a dog in the family the first chance we got when we were living together with my wife we got a dog what have the dogs taught you dogs live extremely in the moment they only see what is happening at that moment in your life and they are very reactive to behaviour in general they have taught me you get back what you give immediately i believe that is also true in business which is easier—running a family or a business sometimes running a business is easier because my position has a bit more weight than it does in the family what kind of father are you i like to give my children space i give them boundaries and let them do their thing and find their way but let them know they can come to me when they have questions were you raised the same way my wife and i were raised with a bit more boundaries perhaps that is why chuckles what do you miss most about your childhood i had a fortunate childhood i had a lot of freedom within the boundaries but it was such a free careless time sometimes you long for that freedom how are you remaining childlike now i try not to worry too much about things i cannot control what’s your biggest insecurity as a father it is mostly a worry that something inevitable will happen at one point i told my parents that i was not happy about a list of things chuckles my wife and i talk about this do you remember the point you started telling your parents what you were not happy about i know my children will tell me too at some point and it will always be the things you don’t expect so far i can still defend my choices marius van der ham poses for a picture after the interview on july 3 2024 francis nderitu nation photo credit francis nderitu nation media group what is the one question you are asking yourself right now long pause the role i have now are we as the men doing the right things for the teams we work with and does it align with what we want to achieve with the business how can we improve am i being the person my family would like to sit at the table with are you a head or a heart person mainly head i like rationality and logic but i have a heart family so that is complex how so i have a very passionate wife with much more heart which is good my son is three and my daughter is six years old and she has a tendency to go for the heart more than the head at this point it forces me to go a bit more to my heart sometimes people give me feedback that i could use a bit more heart is it easy being a head person in a heart world it’s my default so it makes it easy but it doesn’t always make me wellliked chuckles is there a decision you made using the head when you should have gone with the heart you can adjust yourself to the situation but what is the maximum maybe five percent 10 percent the 90 percent is you and if you force it it wouldn’t work i think what’s the one thing you wish more people understood about you i generally have the interest of everybody i work with at heart when you ascend the corporate ladder decisions get less popular and less easy you get judged for that and it sometimes feels unfair generally i can handle it but sometimes i think why am i the bad guy here i wish people would know that it comes from the best interests they say the higher you go the lonelier it becomes is it the same for you to some extent i have a good management team so we lean on each other for support when you are the person who has to make the final decision then it can seem a bit lonely what do you do just for you as a man i was never a sportsperson throughout my 30s i got into general fitness gym and running which is what i like to do to relax how often do you run i was training for the lewa marathon which unfortunately was cancelled i do it once a week but now i do more gyming i have done half marathons one or two marathons et al what do you think about when you are working out it depends things just come up when i am training i am doing math—i look at my pace and try to calculate my distance and time taken it’s become my routine now sometimes i get eureka moments and great ideas while running just like people who have ideas in the shower what’s the most boring part about running the hard part is getting out of the door haha it’s not boring especially not here because running in the netherlands is just flat no hills but here after every kilometre or so there is a hill waiting for you chuckles have you had a strange encounter on your drills a lot of monkeys and dikdiks that is why i was so excited about the lewa marathon we try again next year i hope our tickets are still valid haha how do people show you love i love being around friends at a big table with drinks having a conversation i have had the same group of friends since high school for over 30 years we go away for a weekend yearly and the only thing we are looking for apart from the accommodation is a big table chuckles we love that table where we can just talk what do you bring to that table i am a bit of a jokes guy i keep it light and put the atmosphere in the group but i also like it when we get into deep serious conversations giving each other advice what’s a special memory you have shared with your friends that is close to your heart when we were children it was about getting our first jobs as adults it was the drastic changes—losing parents et al we live in different parts of the world but at that table we get each other what matters less than you thought it would your title and position if you don’t act in a way that makes it easy to work with the people who make your life it doesn’t matter who you are or claim to be what have you finally come to terms with the easy answer is that perhaps i will not become a professional soccer player at least not anymore chuckles i am an ambitious person but i have learned that aiming for something and developing toward it is an achievement in itself you don’t need to achieve everything you set your mind on what is the soundtrack of your life right now good one i am a bit of a soft guy so youll find me watching a bit of romcom movies and my wife would be like are those tears in your eyes i would of course shake my head haha but in music i am a rock guy guns n’ roses is my goto band what’s the most romantic thing you’ve done you are putting me on the spot here okay without spilling everything my wife and i struggled to have children it took a long time and of course it was a hard thing especially for my wife what i used to do was to write and hide little notes throughout the house in her bag and at her workplace it was small and personal notes of encouragement and in the end it worked if you could tell me

loaded another task on her computer one after another disturbing images and videos appeared on her screen as a meta content moderator working at an outsourced office in nairobi mercy was expected to action one “ticket” every 55 seconds during her 10hour shift this particular video was of a fatal car crash someone had filmed the scene and uploaded it to facebook where it had been flagged by a user mercy’s job was to determine whether it had breached any of the company’s guidelines that prohibit particularly violent or graphic content she looked closer at the video as the person filming zoomed in on the crash she began to recognise one of the faces on the screen just before it snapped into focus the victim was her grandfather mercy pushed her chair back and ran towards the exit past rows of colleagues who looked on in concern she was crying outside she started calling relatives there was disbelief – nobody else had heard the news yet her supervisor came out to comfort her but also to remind her that she would need to return to her desk if she wanted to make her targets for the day she could have a day off tomorrow in light of the incident – but given that she was already at work he pointed out she may as well finish her shift new tickets appeared on the screen her grandfather again the same crash over and over not only the same video shared by others but new videos from different angles pictures of the car pictures of the dead descriptions of the scene she began to recognise everything now her neighbourhood around sunset only a couple of hours ago – a familiar street she had walked along many times four people had died her shift seemed endless we spoke with dozens of workers just like mercy at three data annotation and content moderation centres run by one company across kenya and uganda content moderators are the workers who trawl manually through social media posts to remove toxic content and flag violations of the company’s policies data annotators label data with relevant tags to make it legible for use by computer algorithms behind the scenes these two types of “data work” make our digital lives possible mercy’s story was a particularly upsetting case but by no means extraordinary the demands of the job are intense moderators witness suicides torture and rape ‘almost every day … you normalise things that are just not normal’ “physically you are tired mentally you are tired you are like a walking zombie” said one data worker who had migrated from nigeria for the job shifts are long and workers are expected to meet stringent performance targets based on their speed and accuracy mercy’s job also requires close attention – content moderators can’t just zone out because they have to correctly tag videos according to strict criteria videos need to be examined to find the highest violation as defined by meta’s policies violence and incitement for instance are a higher violation than simple bullying and harassment – so it isn’t enough to identify a single violation and then stop you have to watch the whole thing in case it gets worse “the most disturbing thing was not just the violence” another moderator told us “it was the sexually explicit and disturbing content” moderators witness suicides torture and rape “almost every day” commented the same moderator “you normalise things that are just not normal” workers in these moderation centres are continually bombarded with graphic images and videos and given no time to process what they are witnessing they’re expected to action between 500 and 1000 tickets a day many reported never feeling the same again the job had made an indelible mark on their lives the consequences can be devastating “most of us are damaged psychologically some have attempted suicide … some of our spouses have left us and we can’t get them back” commented one moderator who had been let go by the company “the company policies were even more strenuous than the job itself” remarked another workers at one of the content moderation centres we visited were left crying and shaking after witnessing beheading videos and were told by management that at some point during the week they could have a 30minute break to see a “wellness counsellor” – a colleague who had no formal training as a psychologist workers who ran away from their desks in response to what they’d seen were told they had committed a violation of the company’s policy because they hadn’t remembered to enter the right code on their computer indicating they were either “idle” or on a “bathroom break” – meaning their productivity scores could be marked down accordingly the stories were endless “i collapsed in the office” “i went into a severe depression” “i had to go to hospital” “they had no concern for our wellbeing” workers told us that management was understood to monitor hospital records to verify whether an employee had taken a legitimate sick day – but never to wish them better or out of genuine concern for their health view image in fullscreen ‘by using ai products we are directly inserting ourselves into the lives of workers dispersed across the globe’ photograph frank nowikowskialamy job security at this particular company is minimal – the majority of workers we interviewed were on rolling one or threemonth contracts which could disappear as soon as the client’s work was complete they worked in rows of up to a hundred on production floors in a darkened building part of a giant business park on the outskirts of nairobi their employer was a client of meta’s a prominent business process outsourcing bpo company with headquarters in san francisco and delivery centres in east africa where insecure and lowincome work could be distributed to local employees of the firm many of the workers like mercy herself had once lived in the nearby kibera slum – the largest urban slum in africa – and were hired under the premise that the company was helping disadvantaged workers into formal employment the reality is that many of these workers are too terrified to question management for fear of losing their jobs workers reported that those who complain are told to shut up and reminded that they could easily be replaced while many of the moderators we spoke to were kenyan some had migrated from other african countries to work for the bpo and assist meta in moderating other african languages a number of these workers spoke about being identifiable on the street as foreigners which added to their sense of being vulnerable to harassment and abuse from the kenyan police police harassment wasn’t the only danger they faced one woman we interviewed described how members of a “liberation front” in a neighbouring african country found names and pictures of meta moderators and posted them online with menacing threats because they disagreed with moderation decisions that had been made these workers were terrified of course and went to the bpo with the pictures the company informed them they would see about enhancing security at the production facilities aside from that they said there was nothing else they could do – the workers should just “stay safe” most of us can hope never to experience the inhumane working conditions endured by mercy and her colleagues but data work of this kind is performed by millions of workers in different circumstances and locations around the world at this particular centre some of the working conditions changed after our research was conducted however large companies such as meta tend to have multiple outsourced providers of moderation services who compete for the most profitable contracts from the company this data work is essential for the functioning of the everyday products and services we use – from social media apps to chatbots and new automated technologies it’s a precondition for their very existence – were it not for content moderators constantly scanning posts in the background social networks would be immediately flooded with violent and explicit material without data annotators creating datasets that can teach ai the difference between a traffic light and a street sign autonomous vehicles would not be allowed on our roads and without workers training machine learning algorithms we would not have ai tools such as chatgpt one such worker we spoke to anita worked for a bpo in gulu the largest city in northern uganda anita has been working on a project for an autonomous vehicle company her job is to review hour after hour of footage of drivers at the wheel she’s looking for any visual evidence of a lapse in concentration or something resembling a “sleep state” this assists the manufacturer in constructing an “incabin behaviour monitoring system” based on the driver’s facial expressions and eye movements sitting at a computer and concentrating on this footage for hours at a time is draining sometimes anita feels the boredom as a physical force pushing her down in her chair and closing her eyelids but she has to stay alert just like the drivers on her screen in return for 45 hours of intense stressful work a week – possibly with unpaid overtime on top – annotators can expect to earn in the region of 800000 ugandan shillings a month a little over us200 or approximately 116 per hour on the production floor hundreds of data annotators sit in silence lined up at rows of desks the setup will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s worked at a call centre – the system of management is much the same the light is dimmed in an attempt to reduce the eye strain that results from nine hours of intense concentration the workers’ screens flicker with a constant stream of images and videos requiring annotation like anita workers are trained to identify elements of

attempts to form a trade union don’t sneak under the radar working constantly for hours on end is physically and psychologically draining it offers little opportunity for selfdirection the tasks are reduced to their simplest form to maximise the efficiency and productivity of the workers annotators are disciplined into performing the same routine actions over and over again at top speed as a

with dozens of other miners was a towering sign urging workers to take care “you are awaited at home” it read a stark reminder of the perils working at a frontline mine in the heavily shelled city of pokrovsk “at first going underground was scary but you soon get used to it” said vashkatova 49 as barechested workers emerging from the night shift their faces darkened by coal dust and their bodies drenched in sweat passed by her vladimir putin’s invasion which saw hundreds of thousands of ukrainian men serve at the front has pushed women like vashkatova down into the mines taking up traditionally male jobs to keep the country’s economy going nearly threequarters of ukrainian employers have complained of workforce shortages according to a recent study and in kyiv intervals between metro trains have increased due to a worker shortage with up to 10 of the workforce mobilised nationwide there is a 30 deficiency in bus drivers a former village school teacher in the eastern donetsk

decades working at a mine above ground sorting dry coal she welcomed the opportunity the war gave her to train as a quality control inspector underground her salary had doubled to 19000 £360 and with the influx of women a bond of camaraderie had formed “i think it’s great more women join the girls are supporting each other” vykhrevna said she added that her female friends were initially surprised when she told them about her job but have since inquired about available positions ukraine has the world’s sixthlargest coal reserve with 90 of it located in the donbas region where mining has long been the lifeline for many towns and cities nearly everyone at the mine in pokrovsk a city with a prewar population of about 61000 has a relative who was fighting to defend the country violetta loevska 21 who recently started working at the mine measuring methane levels said she saw it as her “duty” to keep it operating especially since her uncle who worked at the mine had been sent to the front “everyone understands that there just aren’t enough men left if we don’t work here who will” she said as she walked down a tunnel down in the mine loevska stressed gender did not matter dismissing the notion of lingering stigma surrounding taking on traditionally male roles “i knew very well what i was signing up for women can do the job just as well as men all that matters is keeping other miners safe” bluecollar industries heavily dominated by sturdy workingage men such as mining transport and construction are disproportionately affected by mobilisation these vital sectors are expected to face further workforce depletion after president volodymyr zelenskiy’s decision to lower the conscription age to 26 but in the east shortages are especially acute with many families fleeing abroad or to the relative safety of western ukraine since the start of the war 915 out of 6578 male workers at metinvest’s pokrovsk mine have joined the armed forces while others have

in traditionally maledominated roles in logistics and transportation view image in fullscreen women such as tetiana lishchenko are learning to drive a truck which was a maledominated role photograph jędrzej nowickithe guardian but he said many of the most physically demanding positions would remain closed off to women “the worker’s deficit is problematic and female employment won’t fix it” stepanenko said adding that the mine has been forced to change the production outlook this year based on the available personnel beyond the numerous usual hazards and longterm health risks of working in a sovietera coalmine – an industry plagued by deadly accidents – miners in pokrovsk also face the threat of constant russian bombardment the mine is located just 15 miles from the battlefield and russian forces have been slowly creeping closer to pokrovsk in recent weeks three days after the guardian descended into the pokrovsk mine russia shelled another site in the nearby city of selydove setting several production facilities on fire the attack cut electricity at the mine trapping 53 miners for hours before they were evacuated “of course we worry about the fighting all we can do is

Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/07/tesla-wont-free-up-use-of-its-batteries-in-australia-leaving-owners-unable-to-reap-full-benefits,australian owners of tesla batteries could miss out on lucrative revenue streams because the us energy giant restricts the devices’ ability to interact locally with third parties and authorities continue to dither over setting and enforcing standards an increasing number of products from air conditioners to hot water heaters and solar panels can be controlled remotely and consumers can sign deals rewarding them for altering power usage during peak load periods including supplying electricity to grid tesla is required in many us states to enable socalled interoperability of batteries however the company disables that capability in its main storage product – the 15000 powerwall 2 battery – it sells to australians industry participants say they say federal and state governments should impose us mandates on tesla and other battery suppliers according to an international standard – ieee15472018 clause 10 – to maximise future benefits to consumers and the grid and firms restricting utility should be excluded from rebates such as new south wales’ subsidy program of as much as 2400 a battery “batteries that do not offer their full performance via an open standardsbased noncloud control port are too easily locked into a particular business model to the detriment of their owners” said dean spaccavento the chief executive of reposit power governments should specify and enforce a local control interface for any battery installed as part of their rebate programs he said spaccavento said his firm does not bundle tesla batteries into its services because of the us company’s stance guardian australia has sought comment from tesla the australian energy market operator highlighted the potential for coordinated consumer energy resource cer storage in its grid blueprint released last week from about 200 megawatts now such storage will rise to 37 gigawatts by 204950 or twothirds of the entire storage in the national electricity market without “effective orchestration of consumer batteries” the grid would need about 41bn in extra investment aemo’s integrated system plan said “as all batteries tesla sell here are connected to their cloud it is literally a remote software command that could switch the capability back on” an industry veteran said if the battery only has “cloud control” devices that could be orchestrated will instead “fight each other” to the financial detriment of its owners and nullify its potential benefits for grid stability and other services the veteran said authorities have had eight years to come up with appropriate standards a spokesperson for aemo said cer coordination and control was “critical to a leastcost transition” and “can only be achieved with effective interoperability” of such assets as home batteries there is no requirement in australia for tesla to allow local thirdparty access like in the us they said “a number of processes” were under way to review technical standards access issues and consumer protections they added a spokesperson for the australian competition and consumer commission said it was up to governments to impose interoperability or access obligations on battery suppliers “any restrictions on access or product interoperability would only raise concerns under the competition and consumer act where those restrictions lead to a substantially lessening of competition” they said richie merzian the acting chief executive of the smart energy council said “consumer energy in australia has long been viewed by energy retailers as a problem to be managed rather than an opportunity to be embraced” “as a result australia has a huge takeup of consumer energy products but very little thought regulation or resourcing has come with this” merzian said “a gradual phasein of interoperability capabilities into the australian product set will mean huge new benefits that people could only have dreamed of just a few years ago” con hristodoulidis a policy director at clean energy council noted standards for the interoperability of consumer resources would hinge on a final report from the federal government “it is important that households are empowered to make the right choice of home batteries and have greater flexibility to select service providers without experiencing higher software and hardware costs in so doing” he said the federal energy minister chris bowen said “consumer energy resources including things like home batteries will play an important role in australia’s energy transformation towards 82 renewables by 2030” he said state and energy ministers were committed to reforming the national consumer energy resources roadmap to allow consumers to export more solar power to the grid and deliver nationally consistent standards in key areas including vehicle to grid technologies a spokesperson for nsw’s energy department said it was engaging with industry stakeholders including battery manufacturers and “continuing to finalise the details of the peak demand reduction scheme to ensure it delivers the best possible outcomes for all participants”,,,,,,,,Very Old

Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/jul/06/thieves-vulnerable-man-metro-bank-loan,the family of a deaf man who was groomed by a gang into taking out a £28000 business loan has demanded to know how a vulnerable person with virtually no assets could be marched into a metro bank and allowed to borrow such a huge sum peter james who has special educational needs and who only communicates through british sign language was being chased by the bank’s debt collectors and facing possible bankruptcy before guardian money became involved his case one of the most unusual that we have featured in some time raises questions about how banks treat people who need help communicating and what safeguards are in place to stop them being taken advantage of it also highlights how difficult it can be to communicate with metro bank when things go wrong the story of what happened to james is somewhat muddled as it was almost four years ago and the family has only learned exactly what happened in the past two weeks in 2020 james was taken to the ilford branch of metro bank in london where one of the people with him claimed to be acting on his behalf there they opened a bank account in his name once they had presented his id and he had signed the forms they disappeared along with his newly issued debit card at some point later they applied for a business bounceback loan from the bank and this was paid into the newly opened account james who lives in a south london council flat with his wife who is also deaf had problems during lockdown when his identity was stolen covid support grants were applied for according to his fatherinlaw steve hall hmrc he says quickly realised these applications were nothing to do with his soninlaw and stopped chasing him for repayments it advised him to get cifas credit industry fraud avoidance system registered which acts as a warning to other lenders faced with credit or loan applications that was not in place when the loan application was made to metro bank and there were no alarm bells until default notices started arriving on james’s doorstep in late 2021 the family explained the situation to the bank however rather than accepting it had been defrauded hall says metro bank held his soninlaw responsible steadfastly refusing to reveal any information about the loan or how it was taken out and continued to demand repayment getting the details out of my soninlaw has been difficult but it now looks as though he has been groomed by a gang steve hall the family who attended their local metro bank branch and even issued several subject access requests for information that were all ignored say they only learned the exact details after guardian money’s intervention “i help my daughter and inevitably her husband with their financial affairs and initially thought this must be another case of identity theft” hall says “getting the details out of my soninlaw has been very difficult but it now looks as though he has been groomed by a gang “through a relation of an old school contact he met – he doesn’t even know his surname – he was promised some kind of work in a new business” he was told to bring his passport for a meeting was picked up from work in a mercedes car and forced to hand over his phone he was then taken to the ilford branch of metro where the account paperwork was processed throughout this his contact did all the talking on his behalf signing the instructions to him as they went james says he had no idea a loan was being taken out let alone one in his name “at the end of all this he says he was dropped back at the tube” hall says “he had to hand over the bank card in exchange for his phone and the group disappeared with both the card and we now know £28000 “peter says that as he got out of the car the person signed that he would contact him the next day about the work told him to be careful and to keep his mouth shut he never heard from him again” this case would not be the first time a vulnerable person had been used by people purporting to be their friends or by promising them wellpaid work view image in fullscreen metro bank agreed to write off the loan after the guardian took up the case photograph mike egertonpa what the family can’t understand is how metro decided he was worthy of such a loan hall says that while his soninlaw has a steady job he lives in social housing and has virtually no discernible assets with the possible exception of two playstations meanwhile the family has also questioned why staff at the branch did not ask to see any id of the person who accompanied him “when we went to the metro branch to try to get some answers we all had to produce our id but it seems the person who was interpreting while this loan was taken out didn’t” hall says “how can a bank give such a large loan to an obviously vulnerable person without authenticating the person acting on their behalf it is all very troubling” after guardian money took up the case metro bank has agreed to write off the loan and will no longer be pursuing james it says this decision was made on the basis of the new information that has come to light of which it was previously unaware it says “investigating this case revealed how unscrupulous scammers are – they will prey on anyone “we would like to remind your readers to be wary of being rushed or pressured into opening financial accounts and credit cards sharing personal details passwords account numbers security numbers passcodes etc and even handing overtransferring money all of these are red flags for a fraud in addition to the more obvious one of someone threatening you “if you are in any doubt contact your bank as soon as it is safe for you to do so to share your concerns” it says that it is not metro bank policy to ask for the id of anyone attending a branch with one of its customers even when that person is applying for a significant loan meaning this could happen again for its part the family has called on metro to learn lessons from the case ultimately though they are just delighted that they can put the matter behind them now that the loan has been written off “i’ve just paid my annual £75 subscription to the guardian which seems a ludicrously low price to pay for such service” hall says names have been changed the option of only being able to make big bank transfers when you are at home or running any big payments past a close friend or relative are among new tools to fight scammers that are being offered to customers of the digital bank monzo there were almost 3m confirmed cases of payment fraud last year with a combined value of £12bn as well as authorised push payment app scams where someone is persuaded to transfer money to a fraudster customers also need to be wary of shoulder surfing where a thief watches for their phone password before swiping their device monzo’s security controls will now let customers set up “known locations” which they will need

first centibillionaire in 1999 decades before anyone else reached that level of wealth hes still worth well over 100 billion today despite giving away billions to charitable causes and nonprofits over the past 25 years most of his donations go to the bill melinda gates foundation which aims to enhance healthcare and reduce poverty around the world gates isnt the only centibiliionaire funding the nonprofit warren buffett has also pledged donations to the foundation since 2006 but those contributions will end after his death buffett also served as a trustee until 2021 the foundations trust includes an equity portfolio valued at around 46 billion today but over twothirds of that amount about 68 is invested in just three stocks 1 microsoft 37 its probably not a huge surprise that microsoft makes up a significant chunk of the bill melinda gates foundation trust bill gates founded the company in 1975 and remains one of the largest individual shareholders despite donating and selling millions of shares worth tens of billions of dollars gates made a 20 billion donation in 2022 and a large portion of that donation appears to have been in the form of microsoft stock the trusts share count increased by over 38 million that year it now has about 365 million shares worth nearly 168 billion as of this writing the gates foundation has been able to hold on to most of those shares and its paid off handsomely microsoft shares are up more than 63 since the end of july 2022 driven by surging demand for artificial intelligence microsoft has become a leader in ai thanks in part to its investment in chatgpt creator openai it added 10 billion to its investment in early 2023 which positioned it as a top choice for developers looking to use the public cloud to train and deploy aipowered applications airelated services helped drive its azure cloud platform revenue growth of 31 in its most recent quarter thats faster growth than anyone else in the industry meanwhile microsoft remains a dominant force in enterprise software with its windows os and office productivity suite its adding enhanced ai features and seeing strong traction in sales microsofts shares trade for a high valuation of about 34 times forward earnings but with a long runway for growth in cloud computing and ai the cash cow of its enterprise software business and its current cash position it may be worth the high multiple story continues 2 waste management 16 waste management nyse wm isnt the kind of company you think of when you think of when you think of a tech billionaire but gates is probably more influenced by buffett than by silicon valleys tech elite waste management is a textbook buffett stock the business is easily understood its absolutely boring and it provides stable and growing revenue the company benefits from a wide economic moat derived from its landfill ownership and route density that allows waste management to increase its pricing faster than inflation the company also grows from acquisitions such as the recent purchase of stericycle the companys also found ways to reduce costs over the past decade its operating margin climbed from around 15 10 years ago to 194 over the trailing 12 months gates has held shares of waste management for the foundation trust for over a decade doubling down on the position in 2022 the position has paid off well as the stocks total return over the past decade has more than doubled the sp 500 the stock currently trades at an enterprise value to ebitda ratio of about 1725 which is comparable with its closest competitors while it might be a bit expensive for a boring businesses waste managements strong position in its stalwart industry might make the stock worth the price for someone looking for a stable utility 3 berkshire hathaway class b shares 15 as mentioned buffett has been a longtime contributor to the bill melinda gates foundation the way buffett donates his wealth is by converting his berkshire hathaway class a shares nyse brka into berkshire hathaway class b shares nyse brkb he then donates the class b shares the maneuver allows buffett to retain control of berkshire hathaway while giving away much of his wealth he donates about 5 of his remaining shares to various nonprofits every year the trusts current position in berkshire hathaway is actually one of the lowest levels of concentration in the stock buffetts donation stipulates the foundation spend the entire value of his contribution each year plus 5 of its net assets in effect buffetts making sure the foundation doesnt stockpile berkshire stock thats resulted in a steadily declining share count over the past few years as berkshire stock has increased in value theres good reason to expect berkshire to outperform the sp 500 first its forward pe of just 185 presents good value to the market thats despite buffetts assertion that the companys current mix of wholly and partially owned businesses present better earnings prospects than the average american corporation that valuation is made even more attractive when you account for the 189 billion in cash and treasury bonds on berkshires balance sheet

innovation or technology to come along that can rival or surpass what the internet did for corporate america the rise of artificial intelligence ai just might fit the bill when discussing ai im loosely talking about using software and systems to handle tasks that humans would normally be responsible for what makes ai such a potential cornerstone innovation is the ability for software and systems to learn without human oversight this ability to become more efficient at tasks over time as well as learn new tasks gives this technology utility in pretty much all facets of the us and global economy image source getty images just how big the ai revolution could be is left up to interpretation and the imagination but according to the lofty estimates provided by analysts at pwc artificial intelligence has the capacity to add 157 trillion to the global economy by 2030 pwc came to this conclusion by deducing that 66 trillion would be added by increases in productivity with the remaining 91 trillion aided by consumptionside benefits dollar figures this large arent lost on wall streets brightest minds most wall street institutions and analysts have set lofty growth expectations and skyhigh price targets on marketleading ai stocks but there are exceptions based on the lowwater price targets from select wall street analysts the following three leading artificial

analyst is datamining specialist palantir technologies nyse pltr whereas one analyst believes palantir still offers 35 upside from where it closed on july 3 rishi jaluria of rbc capital believes its worth 9 per share if this forecast proves accurate one of the hottest ai stocks would plummet by 65 although longtime palantir bear jaluria recognizes that its operating results have been solid a may 2024 note implies concern about the companys commercial segment specifically jaluria points to revenue thats been pulled forward from special purpose acquisition companies spacs that had signed deals with palantir theres no telling how sustainable or recurring this revenue will be while jalurias concern is valid most spacs have been disasters for investors palantir does bring identifiable competitive advantages to the table that clearly do deserve some premium for instance the scope of services provided by palantir cant be duplicated at scale by any other business story continues palantirs breadandbutter operating segment has long been gotham this is the aidriven platform that helps governments gather data and plan missions among other tasks the company typically secures multiyear contracts from governments using gotham which leads to sustained doubledigit sales growth and predictable cash flow however the companys future likely rests with the success of its foundry platform the aforementioned commercial segment foundry is tasked with helping businesses understand their data so they can streamline their operations commercial customer count has surged 53 over the last year as of march 31 2024 albeit this segment is still in its very early stages of growth although palantir can deliver sustained doubledigit sales growth and is irreplaceable at scale a forward pricetoearnings pe ratio of 65 and a pricetosales ratio of 25 based on trailing12month sales are tough pills to swallow in an already pricey stock market image source getty images nvidia implied

a bubble in its early innings investors habitually overestimate the uptake and growth potential of new innovations and technologies while giving them no time to mature artificial intelligence seems unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule nvidias fiscal secondquarter adjusted gross margin forecast of 755 50 basis points may also be an ominous warning while an adjusted gross margin of 755 is still well above its historic norm it represents a decline of 235 to 335 basis points from the sequential quarter putting two and two together it suggests that competitive pressures have entered the picture external competitors are releasing or ramping up production of their respective aigpus in the second half of the year while nvidias top four customers by net sales are all developing aiaccelerating chips of their own for their data centers the gpu scarcity responsible for fueling nvidias scorchinghot adjusted gross margin looks set to wane and thats potentially bad news

glj research lowered his uberspecific price target on tesla to 2286 per share historically johnson has arrived at his price targets by placing a multiple of 15 on his forwardyear earnings estimate for the company and applying a 9 discount rate at the current price theres no denying that tesla has done what had been impossible in the auto industry for more than a halfcentury ceo elon musk successfully built the company from the ground up to mass production and has delivered four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles gaap profit but the praise ends here over the last 18 months tesla has slashed the selling price for its fleet of evs on more than a halfdozen occasions with its firstmover advantages waning and competition picking up musk has had no choice but to become more pricecompetitive the end result has been a steep reduction in the companys operating margin a reversal to a free cash outflow during the first quarter and a big increase in the companys ev inventory furthermore teslas efforts to become more than a car company have largely fallen flat though it does have a handful of small victories under its belt the growth rate for teslas energy generation and storage segment has tapered significantly while gross margin for services is in the low single digits as much as investors want to pretend that tesla is an energy or tech company the bulk of its sales and profits still come from its nowstruggling and cyclical ev operations the other damning factor for tesla is the laundry list of promises and innovations from musk that have failed to take shape after a full decade of promising level 5 autonomy for his companys evs teslas fsd hasnt budged from level 2 autonomy whats more the cybertruck has been an early stage flop with multiple recalls and subpar deliveries tesla is an auto stock with contracting margins and declining ev deliveries thats trading at a premium to even the loftiest of ai stocks while a 91 drop might be a bit

A0354,2024-07-06,310,1 Stock I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole -- and Here's Why,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-stock-wouldnt-touch-10-133000557.html,with the stock market at record highs youd think that the vast majority of companies would be thriving however this just isnt the case as there is a wide range of outcomes from businesses in all different industries consequently some companies flatout continue to struggle mightily with no end in sight even though the economy has remained resilient heres one business that fits this category that i wouldnt touch with a 10foot pole and i dont think you should either struggling with growth and profitability shares of peloton interactive nasdaq pton currently trade 98 off their peak price a milestone achieved in january 2021 while this was one of wall streets hottest stocks during the pandemic it has since become one of the most disappointing and this is due to ongoing challenges that dont appear to be getting resolved anytime soon lets start with demand peloton is having a hard time boosting its revenue during the fiscal 2024 third quarter ended march 31 the business reported sales of 718 million which was down 4 year over year this marked the ninth straight threemonth period that a drop was registered clearly not an encouraging sign and that figure was significantly lower than three years before in q3 2021 its not a shock to anyone that after economies started to open back up and consumer behavior normalized peloton would experience a slump in other words demand was probably pulled forward thats understandable and its something a lot of internetenabled businesses saw at the time but whats truly alarming is that peloton just hasnt recovered its connectedfitness subscriber base is plateauing indicating how difficult it has been to sell more of the companys expensive exercise equipment and this is despite launching a bike rental program in 2022 as well as entering into distribution agreements with ecommerce juggernaut amazon and brickandmortar retailer dicks sporting goods and the business remains in terrible financial shape while driving topline growth is clearly a huge problem pelotons survivability is in question it doesnt appear close to posting a profit anytime soon the net loss came in at 167 million in the latest fiscal quarter the new management team has embarked on sizable cost cuts which is the right move however its anyones guess when things will turn around a highrisk situation a reasonable investor might still consider buying shares in this troubled enterprise pelotons market cap of 12 billion is less than half its trailing12month revenue of 27 billion these shares have gotten so beaten down that its impossible to find any ounce of optimism as we look toward the future deepvalue investors particularly those with a certain level of comfort with highrisk situations might take a chance on peloton story continues im not one of those people i dont have the skill set to accurately predict when or if peloton will get on the right track and ill gladly pass on the stock what ive learned by observing peloton over the past few years is that its best to focus on identifying businesses that consumers cant live without what would happen if peloton simply didnt exist anymore sure some of the companys most loyal customers would be upset but there are an unlimited number of ways to work out that the void would be easily filled on the other hand think about alphabet or visa for example they are so vital to our daytoday lives that we cant imagine our world without them peloton doesnt belong in this elite group and thats another reason i wont touch the stock with a 10foot pole should you invest 1000 in peloton interactive right now before you buy

forced to pay” photo subject is a model getty imagesistockphoto dear quentin my beloved grandfather tried to help out his grandson by cosigning the grandson’s student loan from the massachusetts educational financing authority — which is like a private family loan and not a federally held student loan unfortunately this grandson skipped out on paying the loan my grandfather passed away several weeks ago the loan is now in default and i have no idea where my cousin is i’m appalled what happens now most read from marketwatch if a cosigner on a loan dies is the loan forgiven or is the estate forced to pay the cousin related ‘he thinks i’m too materialistic’ my husband and i are in our 40s he takes zero interest in our finances he doesn’t even know the name of our mortgage company what can i do research shows that a quarter of cosigners end up making at least one payment marketwatch illustration dear cousin i’m sorry your grandfather passed away and i only hope that he had no knowledge of his grandson’s behavior before he died i have good news for your grandfather’s estate — and his heirs — and bad news for the grandson who skipped town upon the death of a mefa loan nonstudent coborrower the deceased and their estate are no longer liable for the loan according to a spokesperson for mefa the estate should notify mefa’s loanservicing company aes at 8002330557 in order to provide proper documentation “upon the passing of a coborrower a student borrower does remain responsible for the loan” the spokesperson says “per mefa’s policy a loan that is 180 days past due is deemed to be defaulted and may be referred to our default collections firm” in other words the loan won’t go away just because your cousin skipped town “we urge any mefa loan borrower who is behind on loan payments to reach out to us so that we can help them manage their loan obligations” the mefa spokesperson says there’s one important takeaway for a cosigner of a student loan make sure the loan is not for more than you can afford to repay research shows that a quarter of cosigners end up making at least one payment story continues if the borrower misses payments — even if they later catch up — the missed payments could hurt the cosigner’s credit score which could then push up the cost of car and personal loans and mortgages for that borrower or even result in a loan application being declined even cosigning for a loan can impact a person’s credit score a fico fico credit score is calculated using a variety of credit data including payment history 35 the amount the person owes 30 the length of their credit history 15 new credit 10 and their credit mix 10 requesting a lower monthly payment your cousin could request a lower monthly payment on his student loan most reputable loan companies will want to work with borrowers to get them back into the black the consumer financial protection bureau says rehabilitation programs are offered by some lenders “be sure your lender tells the primary borrower all the requirements of the program such as additional costs and whether the default note can be removed or updated on your credit reports” the cfpb says of course it’s easy to see your cousin as a ne’erdowell who took advantage of your grandfather but the truth is probably more complicated than that he likely got in over his head got scared and ran instead of facing up to his responsibilities over the past 30 years adjusted for inflation annual tuition costs grew from 4160 to 10740 at public fouryear colleges in the us and from 19360 to 38070 at private nonprofit institutions forbes reported in april it’s hard not to feel sympathy for your cousin and the many others like him studentloan debt is a huge burden for millions of americans the total amount of student debt currently stands at 175 trillion with federal student loans accounting for more than 90 of that figure forbes added if your cousin is looking for a job he should know that approximately 95 of companies carry out background checks on job candidates and according to this survey by hrcom and the national association of professional background screeners 16 pull credit or financial checks so what now if your cousin gets in touch with you tell him that you are here to help — not as a cosigner but as support to help him go through his finances and work out a payment plan the real monster in this situation is the unpaid debt not your cousin other columns from quentin fottrell ‘our children have varying degrees of success’ my husband and i are in our 80s and have 300000

Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/york-short-seller-took-one-172202378.html,an art school teacher puts final touches on a painting of indian businessman gautam adani highlighting the ongoing crisis of the adani group in mumbai on february 3 2023 indranil mukherjeegetty images activist shortseller hindenburg research wiped out 153 billion in market value from adani group it recently disclosed that it made just 4 million for its efforts detailed below is the war of words thats taken place over the past 18 months nate anderson the chief mind behind activist shortseller hindenburg research has had an eventful past 18 months in january 2023 he accused the indian conglomerate owned by gautam adani — one of the worlds richest people — of fraud subsequently wiping out 153 billion in market value from its associated companies this led indian regulators to his doorstep and forced him into defensive mode a war of words has persisted ever since a year and a half later the battle continues and based on new information released by hindenburg one might wonder whether it was all worth it the firm — which describes itself as specializing in forensic financial research — recently disclosed that its made just 4 million from its considerable efforts compared to the nine figures of market value it helped erase and the 80 billion wiped from adanis personal fortune thats a drop in the bucket detailed below is the considerable backandforth thats taken place since hindenburgs initial shot across the bow of adani group the tale that follows highlights the lengths a global conglomerate — and the regulatory body with a vested interest in keeping it afloat — will go to defend itself it also shows the resolute nature of anderson as he continues fighting back the initial report hindenburg accused indian business magnate gautam adani in 2023 of pulling off the largest con in corporate history it was the result of a twoyearlong investigation which found a number of financial and accounting irregularities in adanis empire the firm said in its 106page report indian conglomerate adani group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades the report said we believe the adani group has been able to operate a large flagrant fraud in broad daylight in large part because investors journalists citizens and even politicians have been afraid to speak out for fear of reprisal it later added hindenburg identified at least 38 shell companies closely related to adani group which it said appeared to engage in stock manipulation and money laundering it cited numerous examplesof those companies funneling money through private companies owned by adani before cash was set to adanis listed public companies story continues the shortsellers investigation also found adanis private and public companies to have numerous undisclosed transactions with other parties the researchers found which violates regulatory laws in india the labyrinthian network of shells appears to serve several functions including shuffling losses into private entities to boost reported earnings and surreptitiously moving money to prop up entities in the group hindenburg said adani group was also affiliated with a number of funds that displayed flagrant irregularities the research firm said such as being offshore entities having concealed ownership information and having portfolios being almost exclusively invested in adanis firms one such fund elara controlled another fund that was around 99 concentrated in adani shares that suggested to the researchers it was obvious adani controls the shares the report said hindenburg attached a list of 88 questions for adani to answer which included inquiries into the billionaires close contacts adani group executives and investigations into the company by regulators if gautam adani embraces transparency as he claims they should be easy questions to answer the report said the response nursing deep stock losses adani group hit back with its own 413page response calling hindenburgs original report nothing but a lie we are shocked and deeply disturbed to read the report published by the madoffs of manhattan the reply said referring to hindenburg the document is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and concealed facts relating to baseless and discredited allegations to drive an ulterior motive it added the firm disclosed information on its accounting practices and professional relationships while disputing many of the claims in the hindenburg report transactions that were identified as suspicious by hindenburgs team were in compliance with local laws and accounting standards it said offshore companies and funds mentioned in hindenburgs report were merely public shareholders in adanilisted companies the retort added a listed entity does not have control over who buyssellsowns the publicly traded shares or how much volume is traded or the source of funds for such public shareholders nor it is required to have such information for its public shareholders under the laws of india hence we cannot comment on trading pattern or behavior of public shareholders adanis report said the firm also criticized hindenburg for its financial stake in releasing the report calling the firm an unethical short seller and guilty of a flagrant breach of applicable securities and foreign exchange laws this is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securities to enable hindenburg an admitted short seller to book massive financial gain through wrongful means at the cost of countless investors it said hindenburg issued a reply to adani on the same day denying any wrongdoing from its original report they argued that adani groups reply failed to answer most of their questions the conglomerate also didnt dispute the existence of certain suspect transactions nor did it explain their obvious irregularities researchers added we also believe that fraud is fraud even when its perpetrated by one of the wealthiest individuals in the world hindenburg research said in its reply adani group eventually lawyered up and readied for a fight though the damage had already been done in less than a week adani known as the worlds third richest man saw his personal wealth plummet by 52 billion conflict over hindenburgs shortselling arrangement indian regulators have raised specific questions about the structure of hindenburgs short bet on adani group the securities and exchange board of india — the countrys version of the sec — sent a notice to hindenberg in june 2024 raising questions about the nature of the report and the firms relationship with kingdon capital management a new york hedgefund involved in building a short position against adani group hindenburgs initial report was described to be misleading and have contained inaccurate statements these misrepresentations built a convenient narrative through selective disclosures reckless statements and catchy headlines in order to mislead readers of the report and cause panic in adani group stocks thereby deflating prices to the maximum extent possible and profit from the same the notice read regulators also revealed that hindenburg had shared its research with kingdon prior to publication the two companies had a profitsharing agreement the notice says with hindenburg set to get 25 of kingdons profits for the short bet kingdon ended up making 223 million on the bet 55 million of which is owed hindenburg 41 million of that had been paid as of the start of june the document shows hindenburg shrugged off the letter as nonsense and an attempt to ward off whistleblowers who expose corruption among the countrys most powerful people and companies one might think that a securities regulator would be interested in meaningfully pursuing the parties that ran a secret offshore shell empire engaging in billions of dollars of undisclosed related party transactions through public companies while propping up its stocks through undisclosed share ownership via a network of sham investment entities hindenburg said in its reply it added instead sebi seems more interested in pursuing those who expose such practices a passion for finding scams backlash is nothing new to anderson whos targeted other highprofile financiers and began sniffing out wrongdoers on wall street long before he launched hindenburg research in 2017 this decade alone hes been instrumental in weeding out companies in the electricvehicle industry his work on nikola led to fraud charges against its founder and he also called out nowdefunct lordstown motors for hyping up commercial interest in its product more recently he took aim at activist investor carl icahn and his famed operation icahn enterprises finding scams has been a lifelong passion he told the new york times in a 2021 interview adding that he had spent hours offtheclock looking into potential schemes to the chagrin of some of his former bosses i didnt plan it this way he told the times it was a side hobby that my employers were sometimes annoyed by fraudfinding is one of his top goals of 2024 he wrote in a post on x in january my 2023 new years professional resolution is to work with our hindenburgres team to expose some of the biggest frauds and financial charlatans in the world anderson wrote i am very confident we will achieve this goal read the original article on business insider,,,,,,,,Very Old

A0366,2024-07-06,310,I Pay a 1% Fee for Having $1.7M Invested With My Advisor. Am I Paying Too Much?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-7m-invested-advisor-pay-120000978.html,a financial advisor meets with a client in his office when it comes to financial advice what you pay can vary based on what you get an advisor who simply sets you up with a passive sp 500 index fund might not be worth a 1 fee while an advisor who helps you manage taxes and cash flow plan for retirement and save for your child’s college education is likely worth significantly more if you’re interested in working with a financial advisor but don’t know where to start try smartasset’s free tool to connect with fiduciary advisors who serve your area for example say you have 17 million invested with a financial advisor a 1 fee is within the average range for the industry but whether you’re getting a good deal will depend entirely on your advisor’s skill and services what are advisor fees financial advisors have several different ways of structuring their fees the most common types of fees are hourly a fixed rate that’s charged for every hour worked fixed a predetermined amount that you pay for a specific service percentage of aum a variable rate based on a percent of the total assets under management aum typically billed annually or quarterly commissions and performance fees commissions are fees your advisor receives for specific trades or transactions they make while performancebased fees apply when they meet certain goals today fees that are based on a percentage of a client’s aum are the most common type of advisory fee a 2022 study by kitces found that aum fees were the majority revenue source for 82 of financial advisors surveyed here’s how they work say for example that an advisor charges 05 annually and they manage a 100000 portfolio at the end of the year you would have paid 500 100000 0005 in management fees which may have been taken directly from your account fixed and hourly rates are more common for advisors who perform specific services for example if a financial advisor does your taxes or makes a plan for college savings they may bill by the hour or charge you a flat rate for those services but if you need help finding a financial advisor consider matching with one using this free tool what do you get for your fees a financial advisor meets with a client in her office financial advisors can provide a range of services flat and hourlyfee structures are generally built around specific deliverables for example some advisors will help you to create a tax strategy a household budget or an overall financial plan it’s also common for a financial advisor to offer a comprehensive range of financial services based on what you need to achieve aumbased fees are typically associated with ongoing portfolio management advisors who manage client portfolios typically select investments moving money according to a predetermined strategy percentagebased fees seek to align your advisor’s incentives with your own the more they grow your money the more assets they will have under management and in turn the larger their fee can potentially be story continues that said higher fees do not always translate to better results as a prospective client you should carefully review what you receive for your money if you want comprehensive financial services how much does the advisor charge for each deliverable if you want money management how have their portfolios performed yearoveryear make sure you’re getting value for your money because even small percentage fees can add up whether you need ongoing portfolio management or standalone financial planning evaluate those needs and then connect with a fiduciary financial advisor who offers those services what should you pay a financial advisor goes over his fee structure with two prospective clients the typical percentagebased fee that’s often cited is 1 of aum although an advisoryhq analysis found that average fees for portfolio management range from 059 to 118 of aum the exact rate you’ll pay can depend on several factors including the services bundled within that fee for example a financial advisor might charge more if the aum fee also includes tax preparation and financial planning while they might charge less if the fee only accounts for portfolio management roboadvisors digital platforms that manage your portfolio automatically using an algorithm tend to be significantly cheaper these services generally charge between 0 to 089 percent of assets under management according to robo adviser pros however they also offer fewer services a roboadvisor will manage your portfolio around specific metrics but generally can’t offer customized advice or services like financial planning and tax advice for a wealthy household it’s also important to consider assetbased discounts many financial advisors use graduated fee schedules with lower rates that apply to larger sums of money for example an advisor may charge a 15 fee on the first 250000 in a portfolio and a 1 fee on the next 250000 that advisor could charge just 075 to manage the next 500000 meaning a 1 million portfolio woul qualify for a discount based on its sheer size if you have 17 million and are paying 1 in advisor fees ultimately it’s important to ask what you’re getting for your money this fee adds up to 17000 per year which may be reasonable given the level of service you receive and your satisfaction with the advisor if you currently have an advisor but want to find a new person to work with this free tool can help you connect with a fiduciary advisor who serves your area bottom line on average financial advisors charge between 059 and 118 of assets under management for their asset management at 1 an advisor’s fee is well within the industry average whether that fee is too much or just right depends entirely on what you think of the advisor’s services and performance tips for picking an advisor is it worth paying a financial advisor 1 this small percentage really can add up to a lot of money over time so make sure to review what you’re getting from that relationship in exchange for these fees finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard smartasset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you if you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals get started now keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses an emergency fund should be liquid in an account that isnt at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market the tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation

A0367,2024-07-06,310,3 High-Yield Energy Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in July,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-high-yield-energy-stocks-124500670.html,finding highyield stocks when the sp 500 index is yielding a scant 13 may sound like a daunting task but it isnt you just need to be more discerning than usual when looking at massive yields which often come with massive risks here are three high yields that are both attractively high and not laden with risk 1 enterprise products partners is a rock in stormy seas theres no way around it oil and natural gas are highly volatile commodities but just because a company operates in the oil and gas industry doesnt mean it is risky enterprise products partners nyse epd and its hefty 7 distribution yield is a perfect example this master limited partnership mlp owns the vital energy infrastructure that helps move oil and natural gas around the world it charges fees for the use of its assets so demand for energy is more important than energy prices energy demand tends to be high regardless of where oil prices are thats the backstory behind enterprises streak of 25 consecutive annual distribution increases it also has an investmentgraderated balance sheet and its distributable cash flow covers its distribution by 17 times which means theres a lot of leeway for adversity before the distribution would be at risk enterprise isnt perfect the yield is going to make up the lions share of an investors return but slow and steady growth coupled with that ultrahigh yield will likely be a highly rewarding outcome for those looking to maximize the income their portfolios generate 2 wec energys regulated assets are changing shape wec energy nyse wec is a regulated utility that provides electricity and natural gas to 47 million customers in parts of wisconsin illinois michigan and minnesota the stock sports a 42 dividend yield backed by over two decades worth of annual dividend increases the payout has grown at an attractive 7 rate over the past decade which the company happily explains puts it in the top decile of the industry wec energys balance sheet carries an investmentgrade credit rating so it is financially strong while thats important on the dividend front more notable here is the growth potential of the business the utility is currently working on its largest capital investment plan ever with an expectation to spend 237 billion over the next five years that should help lead to earnings growth of between 65 and 7 with the dividend likely to trail along with that growth and one of the biggest drivers of the companys capital spending is its longterm shift away from coal toward cleaner energy sources which is right in line with the broader trends in the utility industry story continues notably wec energys yield is near its highest levels in a decade suggesting it is on sale if you are looking for a boring highyield stock that can provide you with an attractive mix of yield and dividend growth wec energy is one you need to be looking at right now 3 totalenergies mixes oil and renewables better than peers but what if you actually want some direct exposure to oil and natural gas thats where totalenergies nyse tte and its 5 dividend yield come in totalenergies is an integrated energy major and has one of the highest yields among its closest peers but what really sets the company apart is its aggressive push to diversify into cleaner energy options like solar and wind power at the same time it is upping its game in natural gas a transition fuel and finetuning its exposure to oil focusing only on its best assets all in it is deftly using its historical business to take it well into the future and it is doing it better than any of its closest competitors exxonmobil and chevron are really doubling down on oil and gas bp and shell both made splashy announcements about going green but paired that directional shift with dividend cuts and neither of those two european peers have really pushed as hard as totalenergies which didnt resort to a dividend cut in fact totalenergies dividend easily survived the deep energy downturn that accompanied the economic shutdowns in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic totalenergies performance is going to be tied to the price of oil and natural gas but if you are looking for that kind of exposure with a bit of a cleanenergy hedge this could be the integrated energy giant for you make sure you understand the story there are companies that have huge yields because their businesses are in trouble then there are companies that are misunderstood for some reason which offer attractive yields backed by strong businesses thats what youll get with enterprise wec energy and totalenergies dont delay all three look attractive as july gets underway should you invest 1000 in enterprise products partners right now before you buy stock in enterprise products partners consider this the motley fool stock

steadily transitioning to renewable energy over the years the pace has quickened in recent years powered by falling costs and government incentives demand for renewables could further accelerate in

producers nextera energy nyse nee brookfield renewable nyse bepc nyse bep and clearway energy nyse cwennyse cwena it makes them great energy stocks to buy and hold for their longterm total return potential a powerful wealth creator nextera energy has been a wealthcreating machine over the years the leading us utility has generated an 114 annualized total return over the last 15 years that has outpaced other utilities 68 annualized total return and the sp 500 105 powering its returns has been its steadily rising earnings and dividend its adjusted earnings per share have increased at a 9 compound annual rate over the last decade while its dividend has grown at a 10 compound annual rate nextera has benefited from the steady growth in power demand from utility customers in florida its investments in renewable energy and accretive acquisitions those catalysts should continue powering aboveaverage growth nextera expects to increase its adjusted earnings per share at or near the upper end of its 6 to 8 annual target range through at least 2027 meanwhile it expects to grow its dividend which yields almost 3 at a 10 annual rate through 2026 its longerterm outlook is just as bright given the immense need for renewable energy in the future it expects new renewables and storage capacity additions to be three times more over the next seven years compared to the past seven years highpowered growth potential brookfield renewable has grown briskly over the years the leading global renewable energy company delivered 12 compound annual growth in its funds from operations ffo per share since 2016 meanwhile it has increased its dividend at a 6 compound annual rate over the last two decades the company should continue generating highpowered earnings and income growth brookfield renewable expects a trio of organic drivers inflationindexed rate increases margin enhancement activities and its vast development pipeline to power 7 to 12 annual ffo per share growth through 2028 meanwhile it expects accretive acquisitions to drive its ffo growth rate into the double digits the company recently agreed to acquire a european renewable energy developer with a large pipeline of projects in various stages of development these growth drivers will give brookfield plenty of power to achieve its aim of increasing its dividend which yields around 5 by 5 to 9 each year story continues another factor powering its view is its growing portfolio of sustainable solutions brookfield has built platforms in the carbon capture and storage biofuel production recycling nuclear services and solar panel manufacturing segments these investments add to its longterm growth potential highend dividend growth ahead clearway energy is one of the countrys largest producers of renewable energy it also has a portfolio of cleanerburning natural gas powergenerating facilities these assets produce lots of stable cash flow which clearway pays out via a highyielding dividend recently approaching 6 the company expects to increase its payout toward the high end of its 5 to 8 annual target range through 2026 it has already secured and funded nearly all that growth clearway sold its thermal assets a few years ago and has been recycling the proceeds into higherreturning renewable energy investments the company has committed to deploy or has lineofsight on enough new investments to deliver on its dividend growth target meanwhile clearway has growing visibility into its ability to increase its dividend beyond 2026 it has been renewing contracts on its natural gas power plants at highenough rates to support lowend dividend growth in 2027 in addition it sees several opportunities to add battery storage to its existing wind and solar projects on top of that it has a strategic relationship with a leading renewable energy developer which should continue providing it with new investment opportunities plugged into a powerful growth megatrend renewable energy demand should continue growing briskly in the coming decades that should enable nextera energy brookfield renewable and clearway energy to increase their earnings and dividends at healthy rates those

A0369,2024-07-06,310,Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-nvidia-stock-5-years-113000762.html,nvidia nasdaq nvda has done a lot over the past five years five years ago it was nearing the bottom of a cycle thanks to a collapse in the cryptocurrency market now its reaching new highs as its graphics processing units gpus are in high demand for creating artificial intelligence ai models while it would have been nearly impossible to predict all of the places nvidia has gone over the past five years im going to speculate on where it could go in the next five years although this prediction will likely be wrong in some ways its good at least to develop an investment thesis for the markets most dominant company right now nvidias bestinclass gpus are about to face some competition nvidias gpus are hands down the best in class theres a reason why all of the biggest companies that provide the tools to make ai models or create them inhouse are using nvidia gpus nearly exclusively however that exclusivity may be dwindling because gpus can do multiple calculations in parallel they are fantastic for creating ai models however if the only thing that the gpu will be doing is training ai models more efficient hardware is available for instance google clouds tensor processing unit tpu is more effective at training ai models than a gpu if the workload is set up to be run on a tpu this still leaves a use case for gpus which are fantastic for running initial models however customdesigned ai chips like tpus can exceed the performance of gpus when they are used for a specific purpose google cloud isnt the only one creating these custom chips amazon web services microsoft azure and meta platforms are also creating their own customdesigned chips this could present a problem for nvidia over the next five years as many of its largest customers are bringing these designs inhouse demand for nvidia gpus will still likely be high but it may not be as high as it is now on the plus side for nvidia all of the recordsetting number of gpus it has sold over the past year will eventually need to be replaced while there is no hard and fast rule its common for these gpus to last between three and five years in a data center after that theyll either need to be replaced whether by some inhouse design or nvidias latest product or decommissioned the computing power to run these models continuously isnt going away so decommissioning these gpus isnt an option this will create essentially a longterm subscription effect and five years from now nvidia will likely see another wave of replacing the products it is selling right now story continues thats not to mention all of the technological improvements that will likely be made from now until then as new chip technology like taiwan semiconductors 2nanometer chip technology that will be more efficient than the previous generation will create more powerful and efficient gpus that will help its users out over the long run but is all of that already baked into the stock price nvidias profit margins are ripe for competition its no secret that nvidias stock is expensive the shares trade at 73 times trailing and 46 times forward earnings which means significant growth is already priced into the stock however nvidias record margins are not often discussed nvidias near60 profitmargin levels are unbelievable and are a primary reason why many companies are starting to design their chips inhouse nvda gross profit margin quarterly chart because demand for nvidias gpus is so high right now the company can afford to charge a premium for its products eventually that wont be the case and its profit margins will likely fall over the next five years when that happens its pricetoearnings pe ratio will increase due to earnings either growing at a slower pace or falling this is a huge risk associated with the stock as the market believes nvidias revenue will keep going straight up forever while demand for nvidias products will likely remain elevated dont be surprised when nvida faces challenges with inhouse solutions in the next few years theres an old saying that a companys margins are a competitors opportunity and when nvidias margins reach these levels theres bound to be competition soon as a result nvidias stock may face some pressure over the next five years this unbelievable demand boom wont last forever and the opportunity is just too large for every company to sit still and watch nvidia take their money don’t miss this second chance at a potentially

nvidia nasdaq nvda reigns as the undisputed king of the artificial intelligence ai chip market yet in an ironic twist the companys very success has created favorable conditions for its rivals to take down the ai titan a notch or two from atop its perch advanced micro devices nasdaq amd realizes the opportunity a supplyconstrained nvidia has presented and intends to fully exploit these fortuitous circumstances to its advantage why the nvidia spillover effect creates unparalleled opportunities for amd nvidias unprecedented revenue growth its rising stock price and consequential market capitalization have all demonstrated that the ai infrastructure market is sustainable and unbounded hyperdemand for nvidias chips has dispelled any lingering doubts that ai mania is merely another dotcom bubble waiting to burst graphics processing unit gpuchips are the lifeblood of generative ai systems semiconductor companies such as amd provide the essential chip architecture capabilities necessary to create and sustain such systems tech companies that build or design these indispensable components are the only businesses at present able to convert the ai hype into an appreciable revenue reality hardware companies such as dell and lenovo as well as cloud providers need ai chips immediately at competitive prices to meet rising customer demand they cant secure chips from nvidia fast enough which means buying gpu hardware from other sources realizing the profit potential presented by this current supply and demand imbalance amd has stepped into this supply void swiftly it has seized this opportunity by quickly ramping up production of its ai gpu series 1300 processors as an alternative to nvidias offerings for a tech sector hungry for data center chips amd looks poised to grow its ai presence like other semiconductor companies over the past two years amd has suffered from a chip glut that is only now starting to dissipate as tech companies wind down their excess

astounding growth in the companys data center business revenues from this segment grew an astounding 80 yearoveryear to 23 billion the client segment which provides cpus for servers laptops mobile and

billion ceo lisa su stated that based on customer engagements these estimates are realistic over time earnings from amds cloud gpu sales will far surpass that of the two nondata center segments that have dragged down overall revenue a compelling investment opportunity for longterm appreciation given its flat yearoveryear revenue growth at 46 times the next twelve months earnings amds current valuation appears to be stretched at 47 for the same multiple nvidia barely beats amd by this same metric even though its recent growth rate has been much greater since its categorized as a semiconductor stock amds current valuation however doesnt fully reflect its longterm revenue potential for a company just entering the ai gpu business amds data center growth was off the charts the market will continue to respond favorably to amds offerings because cloud providers welcome the competition many dont want to be locked into nvidias ecosystem by some estimates the ai market could grow to 403 billion by 2027 and 1 trillion by 2030 these projections demonstrate the extent to which amd can benefit from ais longterm revenue potential cloud providers want competitive chip pricing which opens a wide door for amd and others to carve into nvidias market share with its focused ai data center strategy over time amds valuation as an ai stock will grow as the companys increasing

A0373,2024-07-06,310,Is Now the Time to Buy Micron Technology Stock?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-buy-micron-technology-150000676.html,the artificial intelligence ai market has exploded over the past year and among the businesses benefiting from this growth is micron technology nasdaq mu the companys sales are soaring because ai systems require lots of computer memory and storage exactly the products micron specializes in this led to an amazing runup in the companys share price last july micron stock was at a 52week low of 6050 fastforward a year and shares more than doubled to hit a high of 15754 in june but after announcing results for its fiscal third quarter ended may 30 microns stock price plunged does this create an opening to buy shares or does the price drop suggest a reason to avoid investing in micron heres a look into the companys performance to answer those questions and determine if micron is a worthwhile investment over the long run microns financial performance microns postearnings share price decline was due to its fiscal q4 financial forecast failing to impress wall street the company estimated q4 revenue to come in around 76 billion which is a 90 increase over the prior years 4 billion to put this guidance into context heres how microns revenue has fared over its fiscal 2024 fiscal quarter revenue yoy change q4 2024 76 billion company guidance 90 q3 2024 68 billion 82 q2 2024 58 billion 58 q1 2024 47 billion 16 data source micron technology yoy yearoveryear as you can see microns revenue has been growing every quarter this fiscal year thanks to the customer demand generated by the advent of ai and looking deeper at microns fiscal q3 performance was solid across multiple financial metrics the companys q3 free cash flow fcf of 425 million is a substantial reversal from last years negative fcf of 14 billion in addition micron exited q3 with a healthy balance sheet total assets were 663 billion with 76 billion in cash and equivalents total liabilities were 22 billion microns current demand environment overall micron had a good third quarter and its streak of rising revenue looks poised to continue because of the growing ai market the ai industry is forecasted to expand from 2023s 136 billion to 827 billion by 2030 micron is capturing its share of this market in fact micron management stated its highbandwidth memory chips needed for ai to process data and make complex calculations are already sold out for this year and 2025 as well given the robust demand environment micron raised prices as a result the companys gross margin has grown increasing from 19 in fiscal q2 to 27 in q3 micron expects its gross margin to go up yet again in q4 to around 34 story continues demand for its products coupled with the ai markets rapid growth led cfo mark murphy to state micron expects record revenue and significantly better profitability in fiscal 2025 to buy or not to buy micron stock micron is on a roll right now but in evaluating it as a longterm investment its important to note micron operates in a cyclical industry this means while ai provides a boost today at some point the company will eventually face an industry downturn for example in q2 of its 2023 fiscal year revenue dropped over 50 to 37 billion from the previous years 78 billion at the time ceo sanjay mehrotra explained this by saying the semiconductor memory and storage industry is facing its worst downturn in the last 13 years now the companys fortunes have reversed and with the ai market in the early years of expansion micron is well positioned to continue growing revenue that growth led mehrotra to declare that micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multiyear growth opportunity driven by ai despite wall streets disappointment with microns q4 guidance the current consensus among wall street analysts is a buy rating with a median share price of 165 for micron stock this suggests a belief the share price will go up given ais multiyear tailwind to microns sales growth and with shares down after its recent earnings report now is a good time to buy micron stock and hold it over the long term as the ai market expands should you invest 1000 in micron technology right now before you buy stock in micron technology consider this the motley fool stock advisor analyst

A0374,2024-07-06,310,How the IRS is using a bigger budget — and more ‘swagger’ — to audit more rich taxpayers. ‘They are pushing hard now.’,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/irs-using-bigger-budget-more-115300950.html,the taxman isn’t playing around lawyers accountants and tax specialists say — the irs is ramping up enforcement here’s what that looks like on the receiving end marketwatch photo illustrationistockphoto anyone on the receiving end of an irs audit will say there’s never a good time to open up the books for uncle sam’s revenue agents that’s never felt more true say people who’ve witnessed the internal revenue service in action recently most read from marketwatch irs auditors have more questions more staff and are acting more assertive according to lawyers and accountants who advise very upscale clients on taxes in 2022’s inflation reduction act the irs landed billions of dollars in funding over a decade to make sure rich households partnerships and corporations were paying all of their owed taxes the funding was intended to revive sagging audit rates at an agency that’s been slowly sapped of money and people over the past decade since then the agency has been publicizing its efforts to collect back taxes from delinquent millionaires and to rake in tax returns that millionaires failed to file the irs has also talked about combing through corporatejet records and using artificial intelligence to spot tax returns worth scrutiny most recently the agency announced an effort to stop a “shell game” that large complex partnerships allegedly use to churn up tax deductions now tax professionals are seeing that talk turn into action “right after the inflation reduction act was passed i started seeing increased swagger for lack of a better word for a while it seemed like just swagger” said robert kovacev a member at the law firm miller chevalier his clients include corporations partnerships and ultrarich families worth between millions and billions of dollars “for the first time really now i’m starting to see the effects of the funding” he told marketwatch the “swagger” that kovacev sees now is displayed in the extra questions he has to field from the irs increasingly on topics that weren’t part of an audit’s starting scope before the inflation reduction act kovacev said the irs was already viewing highnetworth families as economic “enterprises” with a sprawling financial footprint where tax noncompliance could sprout in all sorts of ways story continues a family’s trusts companies partnership interests and charitablegiving tactics might all be places where auditors could poke and prod “but without the resources they needed there was only so much they could do” he said now he sees irs agents ready to veer farther and farther from the audit’s beginning focus “it was kind of rare if you had an exam team color outside of the lines” kovacev said “you can’t make that assumption anymore” irs agents combing through a massive tax return have “an infinite number of avenues they can follow but can’t follow all of them” kovacev noted “sometimes you find things worth exploring but you let go they are starting not to let those go so quickly” irs auditors are digging deeper niles elber a member at law firm caplin drysdale said irs auditors seem willing to dig deeper these days “i might describe it as eagerness” he said there are millions of dollars hanging in the balance in the tax cases he handles “i’ve been doing this a long time now” elber said “when i first started the agents i worked with usually concentrated on the most important things or the most important issues usually with the most significant financial impact and other things that were less significant were pushed by the wayside as a means of economizing i’m not sure i see that now now we’re going to drill down on everything” the irs isn’t ‘outgunned’ anymore after years of budget cuts and shrinking staff the irs had been falling behind on its highlevel enforcement irs commissioner danny werfel said at a recent tax conference in 2021 his predecessor charles rettig said the agency was getting “outgunned” that’s changing now but it’s “a long process” werfel said “we have to have the patience to be playing the long game” according to werfel who occasionally refers to complex audits as a chess game “so many of the taxpayers at this end of the spectrum are doing the right thing and playing by the rules but there are a material number of taxpayers that are not” he said republicans fear the irs will run roughshod over taxpayers while debates heat up on the future of tax laws and tax revenue to fill a gaping federal budget deficit it’s important to understand what the irs is doing to try to extract more money through existing laws it’s also important to remember that a stronger audit flex from a more muscular irs has its critics the inflation reduction act passed in a democraticcontrolled congress without any republican votes in support the law awarded 80 billion to the irs over a decade to replenish its ranks and upgrade operations more than half of the sum was earmarked for tighter tax enforcement the irs plans to boost audits on taxpayers worth at least 400000 under a treasury department directive that came days before president joe biden signed the bill into law below the 400000 mark the irs will not use the extra funding to increase audit rates from historical levels the directive said specifically the benchmark is the audit rates on 2018 returns werfel has said the enforcement money has been a flash point for republicans who have successfully negotiated just over 20 billion out of the inflation reduction act funding republicans say they don’t want an irs that runs roughshod over taxpayers many aren’t convinced that the agency really will confine its attention to wealthier earners democrats counter that republicans just want to take the heat off wellheeled tax cheats the fight over the irs budget continues with house republicans looking to reduce enforcementrelated money in the upcoming budget year ‘the breeze before the storm’ with the irs stepping up enforcement on upperincome taxpayers michael sardar a partner handling tax disputes at the law firm kostelanetz is already getting calls from crypto investors who may have underreported their gains to the irs longtime nonfilers meaning people who have repeatedly failed to file tax returns and others worried they might be in the agency’s crosshairs they’re asking how to get their taxes in order and come clean with the tax agency before irs notices arrive and make their tax situation worse he said it’s not quite right to call this period “the calm before the storm” according to sardar there’s a better way to describe the moment he said “the breeze before the storm” more irs staff means more questions to answer during audits what does that storm feel like to the people who are either getting audited or are worried about it around the inflation reduction act’s passage one assertion from gop critics was that the irs would be hiring a new phalanx of aggressive auditors overall the agency now has nearly 90000 fulltime equivalent employees up from 79000 in fiscal year 2022 thanks to the new funding almost 9100 of those are revenue agents — the employees who conduct audits the plan is to bring the irs’s head count for its entire staff to 102500 in fiscal year 2029 werfel said last month noting that’s still under the irs’s head count in the late 1980s and early 1990s the agency’s hiring goal “should lay to rest any lingering myth about a supersized irs” he said at the time still a common refrain about highend irs audits these days is that there are more people involved — and having more people means answering more questions elber used to work with one or two irs agents during an audit with one being the lead agent and the other serving as a specialist or supervisor now the exam teams can have up to eight people he said he’s also noticed a new feature recurring conference calls for updates on the audit “across the board they are pushing hard now they are moving cases along with deliberate speed” elber said once a tax return is filed the irs says it generally has three years to assess extra tax it may go back further if auditors uncover a glaring error but it says it typically doesn’t look back any further than six years the exam concludes with an irs recommendation on how much more money the taxpayer owes the government the agency may not necessarily suggest an adjustment but says it tries to minimize these “nochange” audits that bog down taxpayers who have followed the rules if the irs and the taxpayer can’t agree on the size of the extra bill the process can move to the irs independent office of appeals or an array of federal courts irs is reaching for new audit goals the tax agency is trying to make 2026 a milestone when tax returns are filed for that year the irs wants to be auditing 165 of households with a total positive income of at least 10 million up from 11 in 2020 the trump administration’s treasury department directed the irs to audit at least 8 of taxpayers worth 10 million the irs kept up with that goal in returns filed for 2018 2019 and 2020 a recent treasury watchdog report found but the irs said it isn’t following the 2020 directive anymore because it views the goal as out of date the treasury inspector general for tax administration report said when it comes to corporate incometax returns filed for 2026 the irs plans to examine more than 22 of tax returns for corporations with assets of at least 250 million by then it plans to audit 1 of partnership returns with at least 10 million in assets the irs already said it’s launching 76 audits of lucrative partnerships including certain law firms hedge funds and realestate investment trusts a 1 target may sound humble but it’s a 900 increase from the 01 audit rate in 2019 for these large partnerships where the earnings pass through the business to the partners in tax arrangements that can become extremely complicated ‘how do i make sure i’m the smallest target’ the best defense against an audit may be minimizing its chances in the first place “people are really thinking about ‘how do i make sure i’m the smallest target i can be’” said jane ditelberg senior vice president and taxplanning director at the northern trust institute no matter the taxpayer’s income level avoiding the red flags that could spark an audit still largely boils down to the basics make sure all income is reported and make sure all the math is correct on a return she said steer clear of tax techniques where the irs has already announced its skepticism she added that includes not falling for a “weird” reading of a usmalta tax treaty that lulls people into thinking they’ve shielded their retirement money from us taxes elsewhere be extra careful to follow all instructions on “reportable transactions” where the irs is on guard for misuse ditelberg noted massive monetary losses are one example of a reportable transaction the schedule c tax form for business profits and losses can be a trouble spot if there are chronic losses the irs may think the venture is a hobby instead of a bona fide business with deductions and losses that can legitimately offset income in the rarified world of upperincome taxpayers the irs may have questions about whether a taxpayer’s ranch really is a working ranch or if their yacht leasing is something other than a side endeavor questions about the real value of upscale difficulttovalue charitable donations — like a donated weekend stay at a vacation home — could attract unwanted attention if not handled correctly ditelberg said at kostelanetz a growing share of sardar’s work is advising people on how they can get their taxes in order before the irs shows up he’s already well acquainted with the irs’s voluntary disclosure practice where he helps people get on the right side of the irs after they fess up to their unreported income and work out a deal with the agency on the consequences there are now people contacting sardar who haven’t filed tax returns in years sometimes decades “those are people who thought for a long time ‘i’m off the radar’” he said “they seem to be reassessing that comfort they seem to be realizing or recognizing it’s a false comfort” is the irs’s focus on auditing highincome taxpayers fair let’s face it many americans may not hold much sympathy for rich people and businesses that are spending money to duel with the taxman over their bill but the irs itself says taxpayers have a “bill of rights” that includes the right to a “fair and just tax system” and “the right to pay no more than the correct amount of tax” at the conference earlier this month werfel said tougher enforcement is a win for overall fairness and a victory for those who follow the rules “if you’re a cfo or ceo and you run a large company a multinational company and you are playing by the rules you want an irs that makes sure your competitors are playing by the rules and that there’s an even playing field” he said an audit is one way to do that but kovacev said the process can be “a fishing expedition” the inflation reduction act “gave the irs a bigger license to fish” he noted it’s fair game to use the new funding to catch people who are not paying the irs what they owe he added yet the 400000 pledge aims the irs net squarely at his clients “you have to wonder are they going after where the money is or are they going where the politicians want them to go” kovacev said caplin drysdale’s elber said it’s a good thing if more irs audits and investigations bring the system to a place where everyone is paying all their tax obligations “you want there to be fairness and uniformity” he said the trick is knowing when enough is enough — so there’s a balance the irs needs to find within itself he added “what i don’t believe in is grinding a taxpayer to dust and looking at every possible issue one could look at” elber said

eventually go to others meanwhile we get to invest this float for berkshires benefit buffett has invested that float to great effect over the years berkshires book value per share a good yardstick for measuring changes in its intrinsic value has increased at 111 annually over the last decade the second reason berkshires business structure is advantageous is that many of its subsidiaries provide goods and services that are somewhat recessionproof that is particularly true of those involved in insurance underwriting geico freight rail transportation burlington northern santa fe and utility

berkshire reported solid financial results in the first quarter berkshire looked stalwart in the first quarter revenue increased 5 to 899 billion due to strong sales growth in the insurance and utilities subsidiaries offset by modest sales declines across subsidiaries in other segments meanwhile operating earnings before income tax increased 31 to 125 billion the graphic below shows berkshires operating earnings before income tax across its three primary business segments importantly those earnings do not include investment gains and losses whether realized or unrealized but they do include investment income such as dividends from stocks and interest earned on us treasury bills berkshires insurance subsidiaries were the primary driver of operating earnings before income tax in the first quarter berkshire stock trades at a tolerable valuation going forward cfra analyst catherine seifert expects berkshire to grow operating earnings per share at 12 annually over the next three years that may be conservative given that operating earnings per share increased at 23 annually over the last three years however even accounting for that deceleration the current valuation of 217 times operating earnings is tolerable we can also examine valuation from another perspective berkshire shares currently trade at 15 times book value that is a slight premium to the threeyear average of 14 times book value but its not unreasonable investors should not kid themselves into thinking berkshire is cheap but the stock kept pace with the sp 500 over the last five years and i think it can

A0377,2024-07-06,310,"Forget the ""Magnificent Seven."" What About the Incredible Eight?",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-magnificent-seven-incredible-eight-130000381.html,the magnificent seven was a phrase coined by cnbcs jim cramer to group the most dominant stocks in the market the seven stocks are microsoft apple nvidia alphabet amazon meta platforms tesla while this is a solid list i believe it leaves out one incredibly important business in fact if this company didnt exist these seven companies wouldnt look the same so instead of the magnificent seven im proposing the incredible eight which adds taiwan semiconductor nyse tsm to the cohort taiwan semiconductors product innovation has kept it on top of its industry with a 900 billion market cap tsmc is actually the seventhlargest company listed on us exchanges larger than teslas 585 billion taiwan semiconductor is a chip foundry meaning companies design chips and then outsource the manufacturing to taiwan semiconductor which has the expertise to create them the company is the market leader in this space and has industryleading 3 nanometer nm chip technology that allows it to manufacture the most powerful chips possible right now additionally tsmc has a culture of continuous innovation and the next generation of 2nm chips is slated to launch sometime in 2025 although tsmc doesnt name all its clients every member of the magnificent seven is either a direct or indirect customer thats a great position to be in and a tsmc investment gives investors a chance to benefit from all technological innovations made by the original magnificent seven and multiple catalysts are in line to boost its business tsmc is about to experience two significant tailwinds in apples latest announcement it launched apple intelligence its take on artificial intelligence ai in this announcement was the kicker that only the latest generation of iphones and newer will have access to this technology so consumers will have to upgrade to gain access to this feature over the past three years apple essentially made up a quarter of tsmcs revenue so if this ignites an upgrade cycle tsmc will be a huge beneficiary this is a big relief as 38 of tsmcs revenue in the first quarter came from the smartphone segment which saw its quarteroverquarter revenue figure drop by 16 given how important smartphones are to tsmcs business its critical that this area turns around however another division ai is also starting to shine management projects a 50 compound annual growth rate cagr for the next five years with airelated hardware after that catalyst is complete it projects it will make up around 20 of total revenue story continues thats massive growth from a segment that is just emerging and its critical to get in before the lions share of that growth occurs both factors give credence to managements longterm goal of growing revenue at a 15 to 20 cagr for the foreseeable future its rare to find a company that consistently delivers that kind of growth over the long term but taiwan semiconductor is wellpositioned to do it as a result i think its one of the best stocks to buy now and hold for the long term one slight caveat to this pitch is that taiwan semiconductors stock isnt the cheapest at 28 times forward earnings tsm pe ratio forward chart however considering that other magnificent seven members like apple microsoft amazon nvidia and tesla trade at much higher multiples its still a fair price to pay taiwan semiconductors longterm trajectory is just too good to ignore and every investor should consider owning some shares although i dont know if the incredible eight will become a trend i think adding taiwan semiconductor to this cohort makes sense should you invest 1000 in taiwan semiconductor manufacturing right now before you buy

A0378,2024-07-06,310,Roaring Kitty Owns $217 Million of Chewy Stock. Should You Get In Now?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roaring-kitty-owns-217-million-084400259.html,keith gill aka roaring kitty has a new favorite stock the man behind the gamestop meme stock phenomenon filed a disclosure with the securities and exchange commission sec on july 1 showing that on june 24 he took a 66 stake in chewy nyse chwy as of the close of trading on july 3 that stake was worth about 217 million thats a massive bet for gill the combination of gills bullishness and his social media following has made the stock extremely volatile shares surged higher when gill posted a picture of a cartoon dog on x in late june and they moved again following the sec disclosure but chewy stock has already given back most all the gains it made since gill made his big purchase and then some that gives those who might be interested in following him into the stock an opportunity to get in at a similar price should retail investors seriously consider taking a cue from this yolo bet by the meme stock king image source getty images the leading online retailer for all kitties and other pets chewy is the biggest online retailer of pet products pets are common in us households and the amount people spend on them is growing rapidly the american pet products association forecasts that americans will spend over 150 billion on their pets this year up from 90 billion in 2018 that puts chewy in a favorable position in online retail size matters it makes fulfilling and shipping orders more efficient thus reducing one of ecommerces biggest expenses chewy uses that advantage in two ways first its able to offer competitive pricing on pet supplies and overthecounter medicines thanks to its operating efficiency second its leveraging its existing customer base to expand into new verticals specifically chewy has expanded its efforts in advertising and healthcare veterinary care and pharmaceuticals account for more than 25 of that 150 billion in pet industry spending thats a massive market for chewy to take a slice out of chewy health is just getting started the company opened four vet care clinics this year and plans to open up to four more by years end a higher mix shift to healthcare products among its online sales led to strong gross margin expansion in the first quarter likewise strong ad sales boosted revenue and gross margin the company expects its advertising revenues will grow to become 1 to 3 of its total top line while that sounds small advertising sales can have a massive impact on the bottom line since ads command high operating margins a loyal core customer base while the number of active chewy customers has declined since the height of the pandemic it has a growing core customer base story continues customers who use its recurring autoship feature accounted for 776 of sales in the first quarter that was the highest percentage the company had ever recorded autoship is a winwin for chewy and its customers customers get small discounts on items they purchase on a regular cadence such as treats or medicine chewy gains more predictability about its customers orders can package more items together to reduce shipping costs and experiences higher customer retention the company is working to increase customer loyalty with a new paid membership program chewy plus that offers unlimited free shipping rewards and exclusive perks the program is currently in the testing phase both autoship its new membership program and its growing healthcare business with physical locations can be great ways to foster customer loyalty and they can all work in concert is chewy stock a roaring buy at their recent prices chewy shares look like good value the companys enterprise value is about about 20 times its forward ebitda estimates and it should experience strong bottomline growth as revenue climbs higher and margins expand thanks to its advertising and healthcare efforts analysts currently expect its earnings per share eps will grow 178 this year and 68 next year eps growth was further supported by the 500 million share repurchase program management announced in conjunction with its firstquarter earnings report it executed that share repurchase in one fell swoop last month buying 1755 million shares at a price of 2849 apiece from a single entity it still has over 500 million left in cash on its balance sheet based on its firstquarter report and it generates positive free cash flow every quarter while a stockbuyback deal at that price doesnt look that impressive when shares trade for around 25 today it does suggest that management felt it was a fair price for the shares and management has better information than any outsider about the future finances of the company with strong growth ahead of it chewy is a company worth owning investors just need to be aware that gills involvement with the stock could create a lot of volatility in the share price don’t miss this second chance at a

A0380,2024-07-06,310,How Can I Reduce My Tax Liability on a Roth IRA Conversion?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reduce-tax-liability-roth-ira-161130008.html,converting your current retirement accounts to a roth ira is typically a very taxefficient strategy it can help lower your lifetime taxes significantly however it does come with a large upfront bill while there’s no way to avoid conversion taxes completely you can restructure them to make this much more manageable by staggering out your conversion or timing it for years in which you have low tax liability or portfolio losses you can reduce the impact of a roth ira conversion if you need help executing a strategy to minimize your taxes speak to a financial advisor today converting to a roth ira triggers income taxes traditional qualifying employersponsored retirement accounts have opposite tax treatments compared to roth iras retirement accounts such as traditional iras 401ks and 403bs are called “pretax” accounts this means that while you may enjoy a tax break on your contributions going into these plans you’ll face full income taxes when you eventually make withdrawals you effectively pay no income taxes on the money you put in but full income taxes on the money you take out on the other hand roth iras are called “posttax” accounts while you cannot take a deduction for the money you contribute you don’t have to pay income taxes at all on your withdrawals effectively you pay full income taxes on the money you put in but no income taxes on the money you take out since your portfolio gains will almost certainly exceed your contributions given enough time and the right allocations a roth ira is one of the best taxadvantaged retirement accounts for most households this is why many people like to take advantage of roth ira conversions – moving their money from a traditional ira into a roth ira to take advantage of the longterm tax savings there’s a catch though when you move money from an ira into a roth ira for instance you must essentially make up for the initial deduction you took by paying income taxes on the full value of your conversion in practice this means that you add the value of a conversion to your taxable income for the year in which you took it this can increase your taxes sometimes by quite a lot depending on the size of your transfer you cannot avoid paying taxes on this money however you can reduce the impact of a conversion here are a few strategies to consider a financial advisor can help you weigh the pros and cons of a roth conversion in your personal situation strategies to reduce your conversion taxes if you’re near retirement age it’s important to note that you cannot make penaltyfree withdrawals from a roth ira for five years after you open the account so take that into consideration when deciding on a conversion strategy story continues stagger conversions it may make sense to avoid converting everything all at once instead you can convert a little bit at a time by making the conversion in pieces you may be able to keep your tax bracket lower over a series of years rather than if you converted everything up front the corollary to staggered conversion is tax bracket management when you convert your ira or 401k to a roth ira you will add the value of this conversion to your taxable income for the year if you’re not careful this can raise your agi enough to push you into a new tax bracket while this won’t affect your taxes on income below the cutoff you’ll pay even more in taxes on any conversion money above the new bracket it can be very useful to keep an eye on how a conversion will affect your taxes convert enough to maximize your current bracket but not enough to push you into a higher one it may also be helpful to consider that the longer you take to convert your ira the more time your portfolio will have to grow and the more you may ultimately have to move and pay taxes on you also could miss out on taxfree growth in the roth during this time speak to a financial advisor to explore ways to maximize your retirement income and minimize taxes offset capital gains losses when you take investment losses you can offset investment gains down to 0 after that you can use investment losses to offset up to 3000 in taxable income per year indefinitely as well this can be an excellent opportunity to do a limited roth ira conversion by writing down up to 3000 in capital gains losses you can offset some of the increased taxable income that you will see from the ira time conversions to market downturns similarly you can also time your conversion to unrealized losses in the stock market when you make a roth ira conversion you increase your taxable income by the entire amount converted as a result you’re better off moving the smallest amount of money possible this makes market downturns an opportunity to minimize your tax liability time your conversion to when your ira portfolio loses value a 10 market downturn means that you might move 10 less cash over to your roth ira reducing the impact on your taxes however you’ll also be contributing less to the roth than if the market was in better shape a financial advisor can help you project your income and taxes in multiple scenarios pay attention to income triggers finally remember that the rules to many different programs are linked to your annual income from student aid to medicaid tax credits and more a vast number of different public and private entities base your eligibility on this or last year’s taxable income for the self employed this is particularly essential your real estimated and selfemployment taxes are all based on your agi so a change in your taxed income can change several different areas of taxation make sure to look at any program or grant that you depend on before making a conversion and structure your conversion to keep your income below any applicable caps you don’t want to roll your portfolio over just to discover that doing so made you ineligible for tuition assistance bottom line a roth ira conversion is a very good longterm plan for most households but it comes with a large tax bill attached you cannot avoid paying those taxes but you can structure your conversion to minimize its impact roth ira planning tips tax advantages are all well and good but a roth ira is really only valuable if it delivers growth otherwise you’re saving taxes on money that never actually happened so… what kind of return can you expect from a roth ira a financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive

are in very good shape there are certain variables that we haven’t accounted for above one big variable is the cost of college there is a wide range of possibilities there all the way from paying nothing to spending 70000 or more per year for a private university and while you do have some dedicated college savings a big college expense could force you to dip into retirement savings which could require you to either work longer or reduce your retirement spending there are also plenty of things about your situation that could change over the years from your job to your health to the investment returns you receive to your personal goals no financial plan no matter how good is ever a finished product and it is important to regularly reevaluate to make sure you’re still on track when it comes to your plan for withdrawals especially in the early years of retirement i would also be careful about making minimizing taxes too high of a priority looking for help with a financial question this tool can help match you with potential advisors you certainly don’t want to pay more than you have to and being taxconscious in your approach is the right idea but it may be smart to have some taxable income in those earlier years to fill up those lower tax brackets which might allow you to avoid higher tax brackets down the line and actually pay fewer taxes over the long term i would also consider the possibility that living off cash and bonds during your first few years of retirement could cause your overall asset allocation to be more conservative than it needs to be for your goals and risk tolerance it can certainly make sense to keep ample cash reserves so that you’re not as susceptible to shortterm market movements but being too conservative could sacrifice longterm growth and security and remember that paying taxes just means your money has grown which is a good thing of course it’s also important to acknowledge that there are many details about your situation that i don’t know so i’m certainly not in any position to give you specific advice on withdrawal and tax strategies these are just things to consider as you continue to finetune your plan next steps you seem to be right on track for your major goals with some wiggle room to weather the unexpected which is right where you want to be as long as you continue to review your goals save and make adjustments along the way you should be in good shape investing and retirement planning tips if you have questions specific to your investing and retirement situation a financial advisor can help finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard smartasset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you if you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals get started now as you plan for retirement keep an eye on social security use

A0383,2024-07-06,310,Better Chip Stock: AMD vs. Micron,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-chip-stock-amd-vs-091000911.html,advanced micro devices nasdaq amd and micron technologies nasdaq mu are both underdogs in their respective markets amd is the worlds secondlargest maker of x86 cpus and discrete gpus after intel nasdaq intc and nvidia nasdaq nvda respectively micron is the worlds thirdlargest producer of dram chips and its fourthlargest supplier of nand chips samsung and sk hynix lead both the dram and nand markets yet amd and micron both have unique competitive advantages amd by outsourcing its production to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing sells denser cheaper and more powerefficient cpus than intel it also sells cheaper gpus than nvidia micron which operates its own foundries produces denser memory chips than its south korean competitors image source getty images those strengths enabled both chipmakers to weather tough macro cyclical and competitive headwinds over the past 10 years amds stock price soared 3770 as it gained ground against intel in x86 cpus kept pace with nvidia in discrete gpus and carved out a defensible niche with its custom apus for gaming consoles microns stock rallied more than 300 as the expansion of the mobile data center pc and connected vehicle markets generated cyclical but steady demand for its dram and nand chips amd has clearly been the more exciting play for growthoriented investors but is it still the better buy right now lets take a fresh look at both companies to decide both companies face cyclical headwinds in 2023 amd generated 29 of its revenue from its sales of epyc cpus and instinct gpus for data centers it generated another 27 of its sales from gaming gpus for pcs and custom apus for consoles 23 from its sales of embedded chips including xilinxs programmable chips and the remaining 21 from x86 cpus for pcs amds revenue fell 4 for the year as its declining sales of pc and gaming chips offset its stronger sales of data center and embedded chips for the growing ai market its sales of pc cpus and gpus declined as fewer people upgraded their pcs following the industrys temporary growth spurt during the pandemic and its sales of custom apus slipped as sony and microsoft sold fewer consoles inflationary headwinds for consumer spending exacerbated that slowdown as a result amds adjusted gross margin shrank two percentage points to 50 in 2023 as its adjusted earnings plunged 24 but for 2024 analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 5 and 23 respectively as it ships more data center chips for the booming ai market and the pc and gaming markets stabilize for 2025 analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to increase 28 and 60 respectively story continues in fiscal 2023 which ended last august microns revenue plummeted 49 its adjusted gross margin turned negative and it posted an adjusted net loss its sales of dram chips 71 of its top line and nand chips 27 shriveled as pc shipments fizzled out and the 5g upgrade cycle for smartphones ended the macro headwinds also drove its data customers to prioritize aioriented purchases of gpus over new memory chips but in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 microns revenue surged 51 year over year as the pc and smartphone markets stabilized and data centers upgraded their solidstate drives ssds and highbandwidth memory hbm chips to process more ai tasks its adjusted gross margin and adjusted earnings also turned positive again for the full year analysts expect microns revenue to grow 50 with an adjusted profit for fiscal 2025 they expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to increase by 54 and 676 respectively as a new growth cycle begins but one stock seems to be the better value amd and micron should both experience accelerating growth over the next two years as their core markets warm up again however amd looks a bit pricey at 48 times forward earnings especially when nvidia which is growing faster with more exposure to the ai market has a forward multiple of 49 micron trades at just 16 times forward earnings amds valuations seem to be inflated by the markets high expectations for its instinct gpus which cost much less than nvidias h100 gpus for the aidriven data center market but amd only generates a sliver of its revenue from those chips and is highly exposed to the wobblier pc and gaming console markets investors also seem bullish on microns growth potential in the ai market but its cyclical recovery is clearer and it looks more reasonably valued thats why i believe the memory chipmaker is a better buy than amd right now should you invest 1000 in advanced micro devices right now before you buy stock in advanced micro devices

A0386,2024-07-06,310,3 High-Yield Dividend ETFs to Buy to Generate Passive Income,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-high-yield-dividend-etfs-095000249.html,passive often isnt viewed as a positive quality when used to describe an individual it implies the person sits back and lets things happen to them frequently bad things but passive income is a different story altogether an investor with great sources of passive income sits back and lets good things happen namely allowing money to flow in regularly what are some great sources of passive income i think exchangetraded funds etfs are a smart place to look here are three highyield dividend etfs to buy to generate passive income listed alphabetically 1 investco sp smallcap high dividend low volatility etf the invesco sp smallcap high dividend low volatility etf nysemkt xshd managed by invesco pays a skyhigh 30day sec yield of 772 this yield by the way reflects the net investment income per share less expenses over the previous 30 days divided by the current maximum offering price the us securities and exchange commission sec developed it as a way for investors to compare funds as the etfs name hints it focuses on smallcap stocks with high dividend yields but relatively low volatility over the past 12 months the invesco etf owns 57 stocks its top holdings include highwoods properties organon armour residential reit two harbors investment corp and ellington financial income investors will probably like that the investco sp smallcap high dividend low volatility etf pays distributions monthly they might also like the funds manageable annual expense ratio of 03 whats not to like despite generating great income the fund hasnt performed very well historically since its inception in december 2016 this investco etfs average annual return is 117 2 jpmorgan equity premium income etf the jpmorgan equity premium income etf nysemkt jepi managed by jpmorgan chase isnt too far behind the invest etf in generating passive income this funds 30day sec yield stood at 755 as of may 31 2024 this etf uses a proprietary process to select stocks with less volatility that may or may not pay dividends it sells outofthemoney sp 500 index call options to generate income like the investco etf the jpmorgan etf makes monthly distributions the jpmorgan equity premium income etf currently owns 133 stocks its top holdings include microsoft amazon progressive meta platforms and trane technologies this etf has an annual expense ratio of 035 its performance has been strong with an average annual return of 1257 since its inception in may 2020 arguably the main knock against the jpmorgan equity premium income etf is that it hasnt been around very long story continues 3 spdr portfolio sp 500 high dividend etf the spdr portfolio sp 500 high dividend etf nysemkt spyd is managed by state street it offers a 30day sec yield of 468 its name gives away the etfs focus the spdr etf invests in stocks in the sp 500 index with high dividend yields the fund owns 75 stocks with top holdings including iron mountain public service enterprise group williams companies international paper and hasbro one big plus for this etf is its low cost the funds annual expense ratio is only 007 the spdr etf has also performed relatively well historically with an average annual return of nearly 86 since its inception in october 2015 unlike the invesco and jpmorgan etfs the spdr portfolio sp 500 high dividend etf pays distributions quarterly instead of monthly however the combination of the funds juicy yield low cost and track record of positive returns could make it a good pick for investors seeking passive income should you invest 1000 in spdr series trust spdr portfolio sp 500 high dividend etf right now before

A0387,2024-07-06,310,Amazon Is Now the Best-Performing Stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average In 2024. Is It a Buy Around Its All-Time High?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-now-best-performing-stock-103500400.html,amazon nasdaq amzn joined the dow jones industrial average in late february giving the traditionally stodgy incomeoriented index more exposure to growth amazon has continued its torrid run since 2023 as of june 27 it is the bestperforming stock in the index heres why amazon continues to climb higher and whether the growth stock is worth buying around its alltime high image source getty images amazon is gushing cash before changing its name to alphabet nasdaq googl nasdaq goog google was named after its flagship search engine but youtube is arguably alphabets crown jewel facebook was named after its flagship social media app but then changed its name to meta platforms nasdaq meta instagram is arguably more valuable than facebook today similarly amazon is named after its only retail outlet but amazon web services aws is where much of the value lies aws is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure according to hg insights 2023 infrastructure as a service market report aws had a 501 market share among the top 10 cloud providers and the highest yearoveryear customer count growth at 31 aws has been tapping into startups with 86 of aws customers spending less than 1000 a month on aws services according to hg insights the impact of aws on the broader business is undeniable heres a look at amazons trailing12month ttm results as of the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same periods over the last five years metric q1 2020 ttm q1 2021 ttm q1 2022 ttm q1 2023 ttm q1 2024 ttm north america revenue 18109 billion 25452 billion 28471 billion 32352 billion 36229 billion north america operating income 606 billion 1079 billion 225 billion 381 million 1896 billion international revenue 7764 billion 11596 billion 1259 billion 11837 billion 13401 billion international operating income 2 billion 237 billion 346 billion 771 billion 903 million aws revenue 3755 billion 4865 billion 6714 billion 83 billion 9444 billion aws operating income 1005 billion 1462 billion 2089 billion 2145 billion 2893 billion data source amazon notice the inconsistent operating income from amazons north america and international segments as well as the somewhat sluggish topline growth meanwhile aws has been a juggernaut with ttm operating income increasing nearly threefold in just five years the most impressive metric in this table is that aws operating income has grown faster than aws revenue suggesting that margins are improving not long ago one of the biggest red flags for amazons investment thesis was that aws couldnt keep up its margins in the face of mounting competition but the results tell a different story and are likely a reason why the stock has been crushing the market as of late story continues amzn chart a higherquality business amazon is notorious for reinvesting profits back into the company so using net incomebased metrics like the pricetoearnings ratio can be unhelpful traditionally amazons goto metric was its pricetosales ratio which is the value of a company compared to its revenue in the following chart youll notice that amazons ps ratio is higher than historical levels suggesting the stock is more expensive amzn ps ratio chart the ps ratio can be useful when dealing with a consistent business over a period of time but the issue with using it to evaluate amazon is that the company is fundamentally different today than it was even two to three years ago because of the growth of aws thats why i think the best way to value amazon is by looking at its ps ratio within the context of its operating income and operating margin amzn cash from operations ttm chart this chart is perhaps the simplest way to visualize amazons success amazons ttm operating income is nearly 100 billion and its operating margin is at a 10year high thanks to aws and a rebound in its north america and international segments paying a 353 ps ratio for a highgrowth lowmargin business is one thing but that same ratio for a company growing its top line and expanding margins is entirely different the biggest bull case for amazon is that it is within striking distance of its historical ps ratio but the quality of the business is vastly improved and it is on a path toward consistent profitability after all analyst consensus estimates call for 455 in 2024 earnings per share eps and 578 in 2025 eps giving amazon a 341 pe based on 2025 estimated earnings thats not a skyhigh valuation especially when considering the stock is up 130 in 18 months amazon is stretched thin but is still a good buy amazon is at the top of its game but its stock chart reflects that warren buffett once said you pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus in other words consensus positivity toward a company usually results in an expensive stock price just as an outoffavor stock can be quite cheap less than two years ago amazon was under immense pressure due to slowing growth and recession fears it was the opposite of a cheery consensus today amazon is once again a darling but the longterm investment thesis has also gotten stronger as aws continues to be a highmargin growth engine that can fuel the companys other exploits all told amazon is a decent buy but it is no longer the nobrainer buy it was before it still must grow into its valuation and prove its higher margins arent a oneoff if growth slows expect amazon to be under pressure the higher a stock runs up in the short term the more its valuation gets stretched but over the long term amazon certainly has the trajectory needed to compound earnings and benefit patient investors should you invest 1000 in amazon right

A0389,2024-07-06,310,5 Relatively Secure And Cheap Dividend Stocks To Invest In - July 2024,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702278-5-relatively-secure-cheap-dividend-stocks-invest-july-2024?source=feed_all_articles,olivier le moal authors note this is our monthly series on dividend stocks usually published in the first week of every month we scan the universe of roughly 7500 stocks listed and traded on us exchanges and use our proprietary filtering criteria to select five relatively safe stocks that may be trading cheaper compared to their historical valuations some of the sections in the article like selection processmethodology are repeated each month with few changes this is intentional as well as unavoidable as this is necessary for the new readers to be able to conceptualize the process regular readers of this series could skip such sections to avoid repetitiveness markets are always unpredictable however to be a successful investor fortunately we do not need to know exactly where the market is going we believe it is not possible to catch the exact bottom or the peak so it is best to invest regularly and consistently in good solid dividendpaying stocks when their valuations are attractive against this backdrop keeping some cash reserves and dry powder ready to deal with any scenario is important data by ycharts the main goal of this series of articles is to shortlist and highlight companies that have a solid history of paying and raising dividends in addition we demand that these companies support strong fundamentals carry low debt and are offered at a relatively cheaper valuation these dgi stocks are not going to make anyone rich overnight but if your goal is to attain financial freedom by owning stocks that would grow dividends over time meaningfully and sustainably then you are at the right place these lists are not necessarily recommendations to buy but a shortlist of probable candidates for further research the purpose is to keep our buy list handy and dry powder ready so we can use the opportunity when the time is right besides every month this analysis is able to highlight a few companies that otherwise would not be on our radar every month we start with roughly 7500 stocks that are listed and traded on us exchanges including overthecounter otc networks using our filtering criteria the initial list is quickly narrowed to roughly 700 stocks mostly dividendpaying and dividendgrowing from thereon by using various data elements including dividend history payout ratios revenue growth debt ratios eps growth etc we calculate a dividend quality score for each stock that measures the relative safety and sustainability of the dividend in addition to dividend safety we also seek cheaper valuations we also demand that the selected companies have an established business model solid dividend history manageable debt and an investmentgrade credit rating this month we highlight three groups with five stocks each that have an average dividend yield as a group of 361 530 and 778 respectively the first list is for conservative and riskaverse investors while the second is for investors seeking higher yields but still wanting relatively safe dividends the third group is for yieldhungry investors but comes with an elevated risk and we urge investors to exercise caution notes 1 please note that when we use the term safe in relation to stocks and investments it should be interpreted as relatively safe because nothing is absolutely safe in investing even though we present only 5 to 10 stocks in our final list one should have 1520 stocks at a minimum in a welldiversified portfolio 2 all tables in this article are created by the author unless explicitly specified the stock data have been sourced from various sources such as seeking alpha yahoo finance gurufocus morningstar and ccclist dividend radar the selection process note regular readers of this series could skip this section to avoid repetitiveness we include this section in part for new readers to provide the necessary background and perspective readers can also read a more detailed explanation of the goals and the selection process in our blog post here criteria to shortlist market cap 10 billion 8 billion in a down market dividend yield 10 some exceptions are made to include high quality but lower yielding companies daily average volume 100000 dividend growth past five years 0 by applying the above criteria we got around 600 companies narrowing down the list as a first step we would like to eliminate stocks that have less than five years of dividend growth history we crosscheck our current list of over 600 stocks against the list of socalled dividend champions contenders and challengers originally defined and created by david fish generally the stocks with more than 25 years of dividend increases are called dividend champions while stocks with more than ten but less than 25 years of dividend increases are termed contenders further stocks with more than five but less than ten years of dividend increases are called challengers also since we want a lot of flexibility and wider choice at this initial stage we include some companies that pay dividends lower than 140 but otherwise have a stellar dividend record and growing dividends at a fast pace after we apply all the above criteria were left with 364 companies on our list however so far in this list we have demanded five or more years of consistent dividend growth but what if a company had a very stable record of dividend payments but did not increase the dividends from one year to another at times some of these companies are foreignbased companies and due to currency fluctuations their dividends may appear to have been cut in us dollars but in reality that may not be true at all when looked at in the actual currency of reporting at times we may provide some exceptions when a company may have cut the dividend in the past but otherwise it looks compelling so by relaxing some of the conditions a total of 70 additional companies were considered to be on our list we call them category b companies after including them we had a total of 434 364 70 companies that made our first list we then imported the various data elements from many sources and assigned weights based on different criteria as listed below current yield indicates the yield based on the current price dividend growth history number of years of dividend growth this provides information on how many years a company has paid and increased dividends on a consistent basis for stocks under the category b defined above we consider the total number of consecutive years of dividends paid rather than the number of years of dividend growth payout ratio this indicates how comfortably the company can pay the dividend from its earnings we prefer this ratio to be as low as possible which would indicate the companys ability to grow the dividend in the future this ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend amount per share by the eps earnings per share the cashflow payout ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend amount paid per share by the cash flow generated per share past fiveyear and 10year dividend growth even though its the dividend growth rate from the past this does indicate how fast the company has been able to grow its earnings and dividends in the recent past the recent past is the best indicator that we have to know what to expect in the next few years eps growth average of previous five years of growth and expected next five years growth as the earnings of a company grow more than likely dividends will grow accordingly we will take into account the actual eps growth of the previous five years and the estimated eps growth for the next five years we will add the two numbers and assign weights chowder number so whats the chowder number this number has been named after wellknown sa author chowder who first coined and popularized this factor this number is derived by adding the current yield and the past five years dividend growth rate a chowder number of 12 or more 8 for utilities is considered good debtequity ratio this ratio will tell us about the companys debt load in relation to its equity we all know that too much debt can lead to major problems even for wellknown companies the lower this ratio the better it is sometimes we find this ratio to be negative or unavailable even for wellknown companies this can happen for a myriad of reasons and is not always a reason for concern this is why we use this ratio in combination with the debtasset ratio covered next debtasset ratio this ratio will tell us about the debt load in relation to the companys total assets in almost all cases this ratio would be lower than the debtequity ratio also this ratio is important because for some companies the debtequity ratio is not a reliable indicator sps credit rating this is the credit rating assigned by the rating agency sp global and is indicative of the companys ability to service its debt this rating can be obtained from the sp website peg ratio this is also called the priceearningstogrowth ratio the peg ratio is considered to be an indicator if the stock is overvalued undervalued or fairly priced a lower peg may indicate that a stock is undervalued however peg for a company may differ significantly from one reported source to another depending on which growth estimate is used in the calculation some use past growth while others may use future expected growth distance from 52week high we want to select companies that are good solid companies but also are trading at cheaper valuations currently they may be cheaper due to some temporary down cycle or some combination of bad news or simply having a bad quarter this criterion will help bring such companies with a cheaper valuation near the top as long as they excel in other criteria as well this factor is calculated as current price 52week high 52week high sales or revenue growth this is the average growth rate in annual sales or revenue of the company over the last five years a company can only grow its earnings power as long as it can grow its revenue sure it can grow the earnings by cutting costs but that cant go on forever downloadable dataset below we provide a link to the table with relevant data on nearly 400 stocks readers can download this table for further analysis please note that the table is sorted by total weight or initial quality score fileforexport5securedgijuly2024xlsx selection of the top 50 we will first bring down the list of about 400 to roughly 50 names by automated criteria as listed below in the second step which is mostly manual and subjective we will bring the list down to about 15 step 1 first take the top 20 names from the above table based on total weight or quality score at times some industry segments tend to get overcrowded at the top so we take the top two or three and ignore the rest step 2 as a second step we will take the top 10 names based on the highest dividend yield when it comes to dividend yield some of the industry segments tend to be overcrowded so we will take the top two or a maximum of three names from any single industry segment we take the top 10 stocks after the sort to the final list step 3 now we will sort our list based on fiveyear dividend growth highest at the top and select the top 10 names step 4 not all companies have a 10year streak of dividend growth but many do we will sort our list based on 10year dividend growth highest at the top and select the top 10 names step 5 we also want to give priority to stocks that are rated highest in terms of credit rating so we will sort the list based on the numerical weight of the credit rating and select the top 10 stocks with the best credit rating again we are careful not to have too many names from the same sector step 6 lastly as the name of the series suggests we want to have some names that may be trading cheaper in comparison to their historical valuation so we select the top ten names with the highest discount however they could be trading cheap for just the wrong reasons so we need to be careful that they meet our other quality criteria from the above steps we now have a total of 70 names in our final consideration however the following stocks appeared more than once stocks that appeared two times adp ci dhi gfi msft tsm v voya 8 duplicates stock that appeared 3 times nke 2 duplicates after removing ten duplicates we are left with 60 7010 names since there are multiple names in each industry segment we will keep a maximum of two or three names from the top from any one segment also if the dividend yield was too low 075 we would rather remove them at this stage unless the growth potential is extraordinary after some pruning we are left with 50 names the top names from each sectorindustry segment are presented financial services banking and insurance banks regional banks major jpm bns financial services others ms voya arcc security exchanges – asset

construction home building dhi len building material construction engg pwr reit cci glpi final step narrowing down to just five companies in this step we construct three separate lists of five stocks each with different sets of goals dividend income and risk levels the lists are 1 relatively safe lowyield dividend list 2 moderately high dividend list 3 ultra high dividend list and 4 a combined list of the above three duplicates removed out of the top 50 we make our judgment calls to make these three lists so basically the selections are based on our research and perceptions so while most of the filtering until now was based on automated criteria the last step is pretty much subjective we try to make each of the three lists highly diversified among various sectors and industry segments and try to ensure that the safety of dividends matches the overall risk profile of the group we certainly encourage readers to do further research on the highlighted names nonetheless here are our three final lists for this month final alist relatively safe income average yield 361 table1a alist conservative income author we think this set of five companies in the alist would form a solid diversified group of dividend companies that would be appealing to incomeseeking and conservative investors including retirees and nearretirees the average yield is 361 which is nearly 275x of what the sp 500 pays the average dividend history is nearly 34 years also all five companies have an investment grade credit rating and four out of five have an excellent rating of aa or higher if you must need higher dividends consider blist or clist presented later msft microsoft msft is a technology behemoth that needs no introduction it is part of the socalled magnificent seven in the sp500 it has paid and raised dividend payouts for the last 22 years and is only a few years away from being a dividend aristocrat it has had tremendous growth in its share price since 2014 and there seems to be no letup in its upward trajectory most recently in 2023 it has led the ai wave from a position of strength as it owns a major stake in chatgpt maker openai thanks to its 10 billion investment in openai in fact its ai services are expected to contribute significantly to its azure cloud growth in the future microsoft is likely to continue leading in the cloud and ai space all that said the stock price is not cheap and the dividend yield is quite low despite 10 plus growth in payouts for the last ten years we are including it in the alist for its growth prospects stellar credit rating and stable and growing dividends adp automatic data processing adp has paid and grown its dividend payout for the last 49 years and is known for the reliability and growth of its dividends at a steady pace it is only a year away from becoming a dividendking even though its current yield is mediocre relatively high growth should compensate in the long run currently the shares are not particularly cheap and are hovering near their 52week high we are still including it in the alist for its exceptional record of growing dividends and growth and excellent credit rating pep pepsico pepsico is an iconic american company that operates around the globe it owns wellknown household brands including pepsi mountain dew gatorade lays cheetos and doritos among others the company is the secondlargest beverage company behind cocacola and beverages account for nearly 45 of its revenues the rest of the revenue is generated by snacks and convenience foods the company generates nearly 40 of total sales and nearly a third of its profits outside the us besides last year pepsico became a dividendking meaning it has increased its dividends consistently for the last 50plus years for dividend investors it is quite a milestone pepsico is a musthave in every dgi portfolio however it should be added at the right price in our view currently it is trading close to its fair price though not cheap by any means it is yielding roughly 329 against a 5year average of 275 morningstar puts the fair value close to 176 a share which is nearly 8 above the current price also it is 14 cheaper than its 52week highs achieved in july 2023 there are shortterm headwinds for the company which have impacted the market sentiment and drove the share price down from its recent highs in may 2024 the main reason appears to be that the consumer is maxed out due to persistent inflation and high interest rates from car loans to credit card rates the consumer is in no position to take any more price increases for consumer and food products pepsico was able to push price increases in 2023 without impacting the volumes but that changed in 2024 all that said these things are cyclical and are not going to impact the company in the long term the share price can still go down from the current levels so it should be added in multiple lots sny sanofi sanofi is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world based in france it is also the largest french pharma company morningstar puts the fair value at 61 a share which is nearly 19 above the current price the company enjoys a strong balance sheet due to a rich pipeline of approved and experimental drugs the company announced a new strategic policy in 2023 under which it would increase rd spending and also spinoff or separate the consumer healthcare business unit apparently the market and the dividendseeking shareholders did not like the idea of increased spending even though the proposals should benefit the longterm shareholders if the management can bring some faster growth the company has relatively low debt roughly 85 billion a strong balance sheet and a healthy pipeline of current and future drugs especially in the immunology segment the current share price offers a good entry point and a very attractive dividend yield enb enbridge enbridge is a midstream energy company based in canada and serves markets both in canada and the united states they operate one of the longest and most complex liquids transportation networks with over 17000 miles of pipelines enbridges natural gas pipelines connect supplies to major north american cities and population centers as well as lng export facilities another subsidiary of enbridge enbridge gas will become one of the largest natural gas utilities in north america after their september 2023 acquisition of dominion’s assets close in 2024 so far this year the company has closed on two of three utility purchases acquisitions from dominion energy while the third should be completed before the end of 2024 however the results from these acquisitions have yet to show up in the profitability of the company enbs focus on utilitylike businesses will likely derisk enbs profile the current debt to ebitda ratio stands at 47x which is right in the middle of enbs target of maintaining the debt to ebitda in the range between 45x and 5x the company has paid and grown the dividend at a very respectable pace for 28 years in canadian dollars the dividend payout is fully covered by the dcf distributable cash flow in fact the ratio of dividends to dcf distributable cash flow is below 60 thus quite conservative moreover the current dividend yield roughly 75 is very attractive all this bodes well for the investors in terms of the companys ability to continue growing its dividend for the foreseeable future albeit at a slower pace final blist high yield moderately safe average yield 530 msft pep bmy bmy arcc arcc enb note 1 very often we include a few lowrisk stocks in the blist and clist also oftentimes a stock can appear in multiple lists this is done on purpose we try to make each of our lists fairly diversified among different sectorsindustry segments of the economy we try to include a few of the highly conservative names in the highyield list to make the overall group much safer table1b blist high yield author in the blist the overall risk profile of the group becomes slightly elevated compared to the alist that said the group as a whole will likely provide safe dividends for many years this list offers an average yield for the group of nearly 530 an average of 27 years of dividend history and an average discount of 12 from 52week highs bmy bristol myers squibb co bristols share price has lost nearly 50 since its peak in dec 2022 and currently it appears to be undervalued it also offers a very nice dividend yield of 575 at current prices only pfizer is another major pharma company that offers a higher dividend yield at this time but it also comes with higher risks the company is facing several headwinds that include patent expirations generic threats decreasing pricing power owing to managedcare constraints and product liability cases the celgene acquisition in 2019 added a large amount of debt to the company’s balance sheet which continues to be a financial risk that said the company has reduced its longterm debt by nearly 13rd from 48 billion in 2020 to 32 billion in 2023 bmy is quite adept at making partnerships deals and acquisitions in the process bristol has created a strong pipeline and has partnered with other companies to lower the development costs of the new drugs as well as diversify the risks of regulatory failure they also have a cardiovascular partnership with pfizer managing the blockbuster potential of the eliquis drug another recent deal is a licensing deal with systimmune to bolster bmys oncology pipeline which could turn out to be worth multibillion dollars bmy increased its quarterly dividend payout early this year from 057 a share to 060 a 526 increase in balance bmy is an attractive buy at the current price and to some extent a contrarian turnaround candidate arcc ares capital ares capital is one of the largest bdcs business development companies in terms of market capitalization and net asset values arcc offers a very high yield of roughly 92 being a bdc it invests in small and mediumsized companies some of which may be distressed arcc has investments in nearly 500 companies making it a very diversified portfolio it has a record of generating a high nii net investment income which currently exceeds 1 billion on an annual basis based on coreeps its payout ratio is under 81 for the last 12 months which is respectable for a bdc based on the net investment income it comes out to be 857 the dividend coverage stands at 115 the market for bdcs is getting competitive and the uncertainty about the interest rates makes their business more challenging but arcc is wellpositioned to continue performing well with over 9 dividend yield there is not much scope left for capital appreciation but we must remember that this is an investment for income that said if someone reinvests all the dividends the total returns may still be attractive final clist yieldhungry less safe average yield 778 notes note 1 oftentimes a stock can appear in multiple lists we try to include one or two conservative names in the highyield list to make the overall group much safer table1c clist yieldhungry elevated risk author note mplx is structured as a partnership not a corporation and issues a k1 tax form instead of the usual 1099div please use due diligence bti british american tobacco some investors may not like tobacco stocks and that is understandable but if you are fine with investing in tobacco stocks it probably cant get better than this the current yield is quite high at 95 the company has excelled in growing the new categories of products however this is purely an income investment and we should not expect any significant growth that said for income investors the dividend appears to be reasonably safe the share price has recovered somewhat from the lows earlier this year it may be much safer to buy this stock in multiple lots using the dollarcostaveraging you may like to read our previous article here which covered bti in more detail bce bce inc,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0390,2024-07-06,310,7 Stocks And 1 ETF I'm Buying The Second Week Of July,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702523-7-stocks-and-1-etf-im-buying-the-second-week-of-july?source=feed_all_articles,corri seizinger happy belated independence day my fellow americans if youre still suffering some heartburn from too many cheeseburgers and a hangover from too much booze just remember you did it for your country you did it for america heres where were going today more on the potential for a resurgence in trade wars and inflation and how i would invest in such a scenario lagging data lagging monetary policy aggravated boombust cycle some of the last holdouts of economic growth are capitulating and increasing the recessionary outlook lets get into it followup on the tariff threat potential inflation resurgence in last weeks article 8 stocks im buying as a resurgent trade war looms i discussed the huge body of economic research evincing the overwhelmingly net negative effects of high tariffs and trade wars protectionism may be politically popular but many economic studies conducted by researchers across the political spectrum concur that tariffs and trade wars do little to protect and nurture domestic industries while greatly burdening consumers and businesses if the goal is to generate inflation there are few government policies better suited to accomplishing this than raising tariffs cnbc recently put out an excellent video explainer about the differences between trump and bidens trade policies and which one would be worse for us consumers while last weeks article discussed both trump and bidens economically burdensome trade policies this week ill focus on trumps proposed tariffs including a 10 acrosstheboard tariff on all imports why focus on trump because according to prediction markets like predictit trump is by far the most likely candidate to win at this point predictit while the stock markets recent rally indicates optimism about the potential for tax cuts to be extended im more focused on the likely negative effects of a potentially resurgent trade war the tradefriendly defenders of trump a man who once dubbed himself tariff man i wouldve preferred the tariff sheriff but alas i was not consulted assert that trump is only using tariffs as a temporary negotiating chip to get better trade deals with our international trading partners but according to trumps website his goal is to bring back our supply chains and build america into the manufacturing superpower of the world in other words trumps goal is to permanently make international trade more expensive in order to give an advantage to us manufacturing the idea here isnt just to tinker around the edges incrementally improving trade deals it is to fundamentally reshape the american economy by expanding manufacturing and punishing consumption to the degree trump did renegotiate new trade deals it was toward this goal of promoting us manufacturing rather than free trade as proof of this simply note that the majority of tariff increases trump implemented remained in place throughout his term and were kept in place by president biden in last weeks article i mentioned that multiple think tanks estimate trumps proposed 10 acrosstheboard tariff would cost the average household between 1500 and 1700 per year the centerright think tank american action forum adds that trumps proposed 60 tariff on all chinese imports would raise the annual cost to average households to 1950 annually and this does not include the impact of any retaliatory tariffs interestingly if china imposed retaliatory 60 tariffs on all imports from the us the average cost to chinese households would be only 170 annually but while it would cost chinese consumers very little it would likely cost the us many tradesupported jobs american action forum sounds like a pretty bad deal to me apparently it also sounds bad to a group of 16 nobel prizewinning economists who recently penned an open letter warning that trumps trade policies if enacted would likely trigger a resurgence of inflation to be fair these 16 economists erode some of their credibility by criticizing trumps fiscally irresponsible budgets with no mention of bidens equally fiscally irresponsible budgets but arguably the most important point they make in the letter is this nonpartisan researchers including at evercore allianz oxford economics and the peterson institute predict that if donald trump successfully enacts his agenda it will increase inflation add to that list of nonpartisan researchers moodys analytics which recently issued a report arguing that trumps policies if successfully enacted would drive up inflation and likely lead to further monetary policy tightening by the fed goldman sachs economist jan hatzius concurs arguing that a useu trade war escalation would increase us inflation by 11 percentage points while decreasing us real gdp by 05 points multiple freight executives also concur asserting that higher tariffs will flow through their supply lines into higher consumer prices on the other hand credit ratings agency fitch makes an interesting argument they argue that tariff hikes would cause only a temporary increase in inflation that would reverse into lower inflation over the medium term why because the negative economic effects of tariffs would cause aggregate demand to drop eventually leading to disinflation or deflation in the goods sector bottom line while my allelseequal view is that the inflationary surge is over interest rates will decline somewhat going forward and the us economy is returning to its prepandemic state of low inflation interest rates that view could be upended if trump wins and is able to enact his policy agenda ive been heavily buying reits lately which i view as extraordinarily attractive given my macro outlook but while reits generally handle inflation just fine they perform poorly on a stock price basis at least amid rising interest rates what would perform best in an inflation interest rate resurgence scenario in my view the best stocks for such an environment are highquality lowdebt cashrich high pricing power largecap companies such as those found in the schwab us dividend equity etf schd and wisdomtree us quality dividend growth fund etf dgrw the former is balanced between value and growth while the latter is heavily weighted toward technology which currently accounts for 30 of the fund to illustrate the effect of having lots of cash and little debt on the balance sheet during a period of high interest rates take a look at the net interest income interest earned minus interest paid for two of dgrws top 10 holdings data by ycharts the most cashrich and lowdebt corporations like microsoft msft and nvidia nvda are generating gushers of revenue just from the cash sitting on their balance sheets having a strong balance sheet with lots of cash is itself a hedge against inflation the better trumps odds of winning the election the more attractive these types of stocks become to me relative to reits although i would like to wait for a pullback in tech before buying those highquality cashrich names which i would do simply by buying dgrw the great lag of 2024 in the world of online video gamers your worst nightmare is a bad internet connection that causes you to lag lagging is when what shown on your screen is behind what is happening on the screens of gamers with better connections your screen shows what happened slightly in the past causing your gaming performance and experience to suffer is this a perfect illustration maybe not but stick with me the federal reserve has been basing their allimportant monetary policy decisions on lagging data and this is greatly inhibiting their ability to set good policy looking back over the last five years we find that growth in the us money supply peaked in early 2021 and then the us cpi peaked in mid2022 and then the fed funds rate ffr peaked in mid2023 data by ycharts at least in the case of the covidera inflation the money supply was the head of the snake while inflation was the body of the snake and the ffr was the tail of the snake this lag caused the fed to be extremely late in raising rates and now it is causing them to be late in lowering rates you might object that the cpi still shows inflation over 3 which is well above the feds 2 target but the feds inflation data lags realtime price changes in very important and heavily weighted sectors like housing compare for example apartment lists rent index showing 07 yoy rent growth to the cpis rent metric still over 5 apartment list the cpis housing inflation metrics peaked a full year after realtime private sector rent indices did in fact the cpis housing metrics also peaked over half a year after the headline cpi index so while the cpi still shows inflation over 3 arguably better measurements like truflation now show inflation under 2 and still falling truflation using truflation the real inflationadjusted ffr is at its highest level in four decades if the fed used a rulesbased approach like the taylor rule the ffr would have already declined 100 basis points by q1 2024 and 140150 basis points today the taylor rule would have pushed the ffr up much faster during the inflationary period of 20212022 and would put the ffr at about 39 today atlanta fed as long as the feds inflation data is lagging and inaccurate the greater the odds of a policy mistake that leads to a recession which will then cause fed policy to whipsaw too far and for too long in the opposite direction my preference is not for zero interest rates forever back in 2019 i was critical of excessively easy monetary policy in articles like the monetary death spiral but in lieu of a change to how monetary policy is determined i believe investors should continue to expect fed policy to continue aggravating the boombust economic cycle recession odds continue to tick up i continue to believe a recession is coming in part because of lagging fed reactions to economic changes but also because the postcovid spending frenzy is fizzling out already the institute for supply managements pmi indices have turned negative below 50 for both services and manufacturing data by ycharts with over 34ths of the us economy geared toward services slipping into negative territory in this area in addition to manufacturing which has been negative for years now is another significant sign of slowdown in the us economy ive said it many times before and ill keep saying it for as long as it remains true broadly speaking us consumers are losing steam their spending power is diminishing you could look at the historically low savings rate and you could also look at us credit card debt and delinquency rates which have soared higher over the last few years data by ycharts you might observe that the current delinquency rate isnt as high as its peak during the great financial crisis but keep in mind two points the gfc was the worst recession since the great depression and the credit card delinquency rate is 100 basis points higher today than it was at the beginning of the gfc lots of people bring up the fact that deficit spending is still quite high 2 trillion a year aint no chump change as an argument that fiscal stimulus will continue to drive economic growth wrong todays government spending is fundamentally different than the spending of 20202021 that fueled the postcovid economic surge back then government spending directly funded consumer spending via stimulus checks enhanced unemployment and ppp loans that kept workers employed even if they werent working today government spending is driven by social security medicare medicaid interest expense and tax credits for the semiconductor and green energy industries todays government spending may be stimulative and inflationary in certain pockets of the economy but the government spending of 20212022 stimulated the entire economy back then government spending grew the money supply today it is simply growing the supply of treasury debt the final point id make on the subject of recession odds relates to unemployment which has been slowly rising after bottoming out from mid2022 to mid2023 data by ycharts if you look at a snapshot the labor market still appears quite strong but the trend is no longer one of strengthening but rather one of weakening historically once the unemployment rate begins an upward trend it doesnt tend to stop moving up before a recession hits its possible we avoid a recession of course but according to historical precedent the next phase in the cycle would be recession and to connect this to the tariffs discussion above note that if a recession does begin sometime this year the incumbent presidents chances of winning reelection go down significantly i would guess that is true of the incumbent presidents party as well given that the current potus may or may not be the presidential nominee for his party in short then a potential recession this year would increase the odds of a resurgent trade war next year and the years beyond my buy list a few of my existing holdings have come back onto the buy list this week rising odds of a trump victory has caused green energy companies like clearway energy inc cwen cwena and hannon armstrong sustainable infrastructure hasi to drop i view this as a buying opportunity for two main reasons the likelihood of even a republican sweep leading to a reversal of the green energy incentives in the inflation reduction act seems low to me many of these renewable energy projects are located in republican states like my home state of texas which generates more electricity from renewables than any other state lower interest rates would have a strongly positive effect on renewable energy companies by lowering their cost of financing investments it is my view that the us will get lower interest rates over the next few years while cwen directly owns wind solar battery storage and natural gas power generation facilities hasis business model is to act as a financier for both utilityscale and smallscale green energy assets at the same time while i find these renewable energy names attractive im also aggressively building my position in sempra sre in part for its regulated utility assets in fastgrowing texas but also because of its strong market

second i havent finished my deep dive of the company yet cmcsa looks extraordinarily cheap at about a 9x pe ratio and a free cash flow yield of 88 even if revenue growth remains slow at 13 cmcsa is only paying out 3540 of that fcf as dividends leaving tons of retained cash for buybacks and growth investments and management have a pretty good track record of solid capital allocation the

A0391,2024-07-06,310,Suncor Energy Stock: Soaring Buybacks And Dividends (NYSE:SU),Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702713-suncor-energy-soaring-buybacks-and-dividends-su-stock?source=feed_all_articles,danprat article thesis suncor energy inc nysesu is a leading canadian oil sands player that has offered appealing shareholder returns and should deliver even more of the same going forward while shares have offered compelling returns over the last year suncors shares are still far from expensive which is why further upside potential exists past coverage i have covered suncor energy inc in the past here on seeking alpha most recently in may 2023 in that article i focused on the companys quarterly earnings results at the time since more than a year has passed and since suncor energy recently made changes to its shareholder return framework it is time to take another look at this canadian energy player suncor energy recent business performance the companys firstquarter earnings results beat estimates where it counts as suncor energy outperformed the analyst consensus earnings per share estimate even though the company missed the revenue consensus estimate slightly in other words sales were marginally lower than expected but since costs were lower than expected as well and by a wider margin the company nevertheless was more profitable than forecasted along with profits shareholders also care about cash flows of course cash flows after all allow suncor energy to reduce its debt pile to buy back shares and to offer growing dividends during the most recent quarter suncor energys funds from operations basically operating cash flows adjusted for working capital movements came in at cad32 billion or almost cad13 billion annualized for a company that is currently being valued at cad66 billion that makes for a very nice cash generation pace as the cash flow yield is 197 not all of that cash is available for shareholder returns and debt reduction of course as suncor energy also needs to invest in current and future assets while its oil sands assets are longlived and do thus not require heavy maintenance capital expenditures some maintenance capital spending is needed and suncor energy also invests in new assets on top of that these investments in new assets are partially to grow production in the long run and partially to replace existing assets production eventually since even longerlived assets will not produce oil forever suncor energys growth capital spending and ma in the past has allowed the company to hit a new recordhigh level when it comes to production as production averaged 835000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the most recent quarter not surprisingly production mostly came from suncor energys oil sands assets where a recordhigh was hit as well with 785000 barrels per day suncor energys capital expenditures including maintenance and growth spending totaled cad12 billion during the most recent quarter which translated into a free funds flow number of almost cad2 billion which would be equal to the companys free cash flow at unchanged working capital levels cad8 billion annualized in free cash flow would make for a free cash flow yield of close to 12 at the current market capitalization of cad68 billion macro environment of course commodity companies such as suncor energy do not generate the same profit and cash flow every quarter after all commodity price movements in this case the movements in the price of oil have a significant impact on a quartertoquarter basis even if underlying business growth in terms of production and refining levels is growing reliably looking at oil prices we see the following wti price per barrel in 2024 seeking alpha the price per barrel of wti has risen nicely so far this year while the start of the year was not especially strong in q1 the average was around 75 while the second quarter average was a little higher the q2 high was higher than the q1 high and the q2 low was also higher than the q1 low the current quarter q3 has started nicely as well with wti trading close to the 2024 high right now from an oil price perspective the second quarter thus was a little better compared to the first quarter which should be positive for energy companies when they report their q2 results in the coming month or so on top of that canadian energy companies also benefitted from another tailwind the trans mountain expansion started moving oil in may adding transportation capacity to the west coast and the export terminals located there this has had a positive impact on the differential between us crude oil and canadian crude oil with wti crude oil rising by 18 so far this year while syncrude sweet premium has risen by a much stronger 35 so far this year according to oilpricecom other canadian blends have performed well too but since suncor energy has the biggest ownership stake in the syncrude joint venture at around 60 this blend looks especially meaningful for suncor suncor energy refines some of the oil it produces so it will not capture all of the benefits of improving differentials but between some differential tailwinds and firming oil markets q2 and q3 so far look quite good suncor energys updated shareholder return framework the covid crisis with very low oil prices forced many oil companies to add debt and in the following years interest rates rose which made debt more costly in order to drive down interest expenses and to prepare for potential future crises suncor energy and many other energy companies decided to reduce their debt levels suncor energy installed a capital allocation framework that would dictate how the company would use its available cash depending on how large its debt position was at any specific time the plan foresaw rising shareholder returns and a declining focus on reducing debt levels as debt reduction efforts progressed the higher the debt level the larger the focus on reducing debt while low debt levels would mean that more cash would be diverted toward the companys owners the company recently showed a new capital allocation framework in its 2024 business update suncor energy capital allocation policy seeking alpha while the company previously planned to lower its net debt to 5 billion the floor has now been lifted to 8 billion the company will thus begin to return 100 of its excess free funds flow via buybacks sooner than previously thought as fewer dollars will have to be used for debt reduction purposes right now suncor energy is at the 75 buyback level which is already an increase compared to the last couple of years when the company was putting 50 of its excess free funds flow towards buybacks investors can thus expect an increased buyback pace going forward which will mean the share count will decline even faster in the future all else equal combined with the expected free cash flow growth stemming from cost reduction programs improving differentials and production growth from growth investments should result in highly compelling free cash flow per share growth in the coming years in its business update presentation suncor energy guides for a free funds flow per share growth rate of 24 in the 2023 to 2026 time frame which would be excellent but even if the company missed that goal and would deliver just twothirds of that ie 16 that would still be a highly attractive performance considering the energy industry is seen as a lowgrowth industry by many the dividend yields around 42 at current prices which is way above the broad markets spy 13 dividend yield suncor energy guides for dividend growth of 3 to 5 per year as we can see in the above slide which would make for a very solid combination but with free fund flows per share forecasted to grow way faster than that i wouldnt be surprised if suncor eventually decided to up the dividend growth rate over the last five years the dividend was increased by 53 per year and this includes the dividend cut we saw during the initial phase of the pandemic when many oil companies were struggling if su was able to grow the dividend by more than 5 per year despite this onetime macro crisis i believe that there is a solid chance for dividend growth of more than 5 per year in the future too is suncor energy still attractive shares have rallied by 18 so far in 2024 so in retrospect buying half a year ago was better than buying today but even today suncor seems like a pretty appealing pick shares trade for 9x this years expected net profits while the dividend yield is attractive as well at 4 as noted above buybacks are getting even better and between business growth macro tailwinds from rising oil prices and the trans mountain expansion and costsaving programs suncor should deliver highly compelling profit and cash flow growth going forward while i do not believe that su is ultracheap any longer i believe that suncor remains undervalued today buying this growing energy company with excellent shareholder returns at a singledigit earnings multiple seems like a good idea for longtermoriented investors,,,,,,,,Very Old

calls from fellow democrats to end his campaign for reelection us president joe biden on saturday gave no hint that he was considering stepping aside after a pair of defiant public appearances a day earlier biden 81 is facing a slowboil uprising from congressional democrats and some influential donors who have grown concerned he lacks the capacity to defeat republican donald trump 78 in the nov 5 election a muchanticipated interview the president gave to abc news that aired friday evening seemed to do little to temper those worries in that interview biden said only the lord almighty could persuade him to abandon his campaign dismissing the possibility that democratic leaders could band together to try and talk him into standing down he held a businessasusual call with the national cochairs of his campaign on saturday the white house said pressure from congress seems only likely to ramp up in the coming days as lawmakers return to washington from a holiday recess with biden perhaps facing one of the most consequential weeks of his presidency even as his future will be debated on capitol hill biden will host dozens of world leaders at a highstakes nato summit in washington and is scheduled to hold what is sure to be a closely watched press conference on saturday us representative angie craig of minnesota became the first democratic member of the house of representatives in a battleground district to call for biden to relent “given what i saw and heard from the president during last week’s debate in atlanta coupled with the lack of a forceful response from the president himself following that debate i do not believe that the president can effectively campaign and win against donald trump” craig a top 2024 target of house republican efforts posted on x some democratic house lawmakers are circulating two separate letters calling for biden to step aside house democratic sources have said many of those lawmakers had been waiting to see the abc news interview before moving forward house democratic leader hakeem jeffries scheduled a virtual meeting on sunday with senior house democrats to discuss biden’s candidacy and the path forward us representative lloyd doggett of texas who had previously called on biden to step aside told cnn after the abc interview every day biden delays makes it more difficult for a new person to come on board to defeat donald trump meanwhile on the senate side us senator mark warner was contacting some fellow democratic senators to invite them to a possible meeting on monday to discuss bidens campaign biden spent saturday at his home in delaware with no public events on his schedule although he attended an evening church service sunday will be a busy day for him with two pennsylvania campaign events in philadelphia and harrisburg at a campaign rally in madison wisconsin on friday biden vowed to stay in the race i am running and gonna win again biden told supporters some polls show trumps lead over biden widening and democrats worry concerns about the president could weigh on downballot races but biden registered his best showing yet in a bloomberg newsmorning consult tracking poll of battleground states with trump leading biden by only 2 percentage points 47 to 45 in the critical states needed to win the november election one bright spot for biden came early saturday when the palestinian militant group hamas accepted a us proposal to begin talks on releasing israeli hostages including soldiers and men a move that could pave the way for a ceasefire to end the ninemonthold war between israel and hamas in gaza vice president kamala harris the top choice to replace biden if he were to step aside as the democratic partys standardbearer spoke in new orleans at the essence festival of culture an annual culture and music festival sponsored by essence magazine whose target audience is black women harris attacked former president donald trump and the us supreme court for

madison saying the president had devoted his life to fighting for americans in this moment i know all of us are ready to fight for him she said margaret washa 75 a retired physical therapist from middleton wisconsin saw biden at the madison rally and thought he looked more vigorous but grew dismayed after watching the interview its starting to be about him and whether he can do it and rather than about whats best for our nation and about turning over leadership to the next generation she said its time to pass the baton there are so many good strong younger intelligent more charismatic

A0396,2024-07-06,310,Here's Why the Petrodollar Isn't Going Anywhere,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-the-petrodollar-isnt-going-anywhere-200649715,recently a few media outlets have warned of the imminent demise of the petrodollar agreement commonly called the petrodollar with such narratives comes investor anxiety consider the following headlines on the topic opec will sever link with dollar for pricing oil the new york times the petrodollar is dead and that’s a big deal fx street after 50 years death of the petrodollar signal end of us hegemony the street pro before jumping to conclusions let’s discuss what the petrodollar is and isn’t with that knowledge we can address concerns about the death of the petrodollar furthermore we can discredit menacing headlines like petrodollar deal expires why this could trigger ‘collapse of everything’ before starting we need to make a disclaimer the new york times article we bullet point above is not recent we added it to show this is not a new story the article dated june 1975 starts as follows libreville gabon june 9 — the oil‐producing nations agreed today to sever the link between oil prices and the dollar and to start quoting prices in special drawing rights the governor of the iranian national bank mohammed yeganeh said what is the petrodollar in 1974 following the economically devastating oil embargo in which the price of per barrel rose fourfold sparking a surge in inflation and weakening the economy the us desperately sought to avoid another embargo at all costs us politicians theorized that a stronger relationship with saudi arabia would go a long way toward achieving its goal fortunately the saudis also hoped for a beneficial relationship with the us and they needed a trustworthy investment home for their new oil riches they also desired better military equipment at the time saudi arabia was running a huge budget surplus because of its windfall from high oil prices and relatively minor spending needs from within the country while there was never a formal petrodollar pact it is widely believed that the us and saudi arabia had a handshake agreement to meet each other’s needs saudi arabia was encouraged to invest its surplus in safe highyielding us treasury securities in exchange the us would sell saudi arabias military equipment both hoped a better relationship would be a productive byproduct such is the petrodollar agreement the petrodollar was not really about the dollar we think the petrodollar discussions were principally about saudi arabia needing a safe home for their surpluses and the us seeking dollars to fund her large fiscal deficits while the dollar would be the currency for said transactions it was not likely the focus of the talks in dealing with the immense costs of the vietnam war and ambitious social spending to pacify social unrest america sought deficit funding saudi arabia needed to invest in its surpluses given the unprecedented liquidity and safety of the us treasury market compared to other options the “agreement” made a lot of sense for both parties furthermore because saudi oil revenue would be used to buy dollarbased us treasury bonds it made sense for saudi arabia to require other oil buyers to pay in us dollars we share two graphs to better appreciate the deteriorating us fiscal position at the time the first graph below highlights the deficits during the mid1970s today many would consider a 50—or 60 billion deficit minimal but then the deficits incurred were a sharp departure from the norm the second graph provides proper context the nation was experiencing more significant federal deficits in the midto late 1970s than it faced during world war ii given the immense spending on world war ii that fact was stunning to many people at the time saudi arabia doesn’t have investible dollars today the situation is different america still desperately needs funding but saudi arabia doesn’t have budget surpluses to invest per a bloomberg article entitled the petrodollar is dead long live the petrodollar fast forward to today and saudi arabia doesn’t have a surplus to recycle at all instead the country is borrowing heavily in the sovereign debt market and selling assets including chunks of its national oil company to finance its grand economic plans true riyadh still holds significant hard currency reserves some of them invested in us treasuries but it’s not accumulating them anymore china and japan have significant more money tied up on the american debt market than the saudis do the reserves monopoly many believe the us government bullies foreign countries into using the dollar thus forcing them to have dollar reserves such seems logical as the reserves must be invested and can help fund our deficits we do not know what our politicians say to other countries behind closed doors but we presume some “persuasion” presses other countries to use the dollar regardless there are not many options for the dollar the us offers other nations the best place to invest for four primary reasons as we outline in the four reasons the rule of law liquid financial markets and economic and military might all but guarantee the death of the dollar will not occur anytime soon no other country has all four of those traits china and russia lack the rule of law and liquid financial markets russia also has a small and fragile economy europe does not have liquid enough capital markets or military might and are often rumored candidates to usurp the dollar for starters they do not earn a return on investment possibly more problematic their prices are incredibly volatile there are many other difficulties precluding them from fullfledged currency status which we will save for another article summary notwithstanding whether there was a formal agreement the petrodollar is not going anywhere even if saudi arabia accepts or gold for its oil it will need to convert those currencies into dollars in almost all instances consider that saudi arabia keeps its currency value pegged to the dollar as shown in the graph below courtesy of trading economics they also hold approximately 135 billion of us treasury securities a threeyear high does it seem like saudi arabia is trying to disassociate from the us dollar and us financial markets stories like those on the petrodollar and others on the “imminent” death of the dollar have been around for decades someday they will be right and the dollar will follow the way of prior global reserve currencies but for that

became obsessed with magic while many might enjoy watching the theatrics of a magic show my mind was always on how everything was done i would record david copperfield and watch rewind watch rewind until the video was worn out i was always trying to figure out the secret of the magic trick id go to the library and read books about magic tricks and take what i learned there to deduce how various performers tricked the mind it turns out that many magic tricks have their basis in math those who create magic tricks use their knowledge of math science and psychology to devise illusions that create an entertaining show today i am going to perform a magic trick which has its basis in math while the trick probably isnt going to get me an invitation to replace criss angel it does provide great insight into how we should think about our investment portfolios and how we withdraw cash from them dividends dont matter some have developed the theory that dividends dont matter and that an investor could achieve the same effect by selling off shares as they need cash their reasoning is that cash paid in dividends are paid from the company and therefore the value of the company is reduced by the exact amount of the dividend indeed cash paid from the company is not available for other uses the book value of a company is reduced by the exact amount of the dividend with each payment so what is the one detail that this theory is missing out on the reality is that the stock market does not value companies based on book value thats a good thing for the magnificent 7 as they trade at enormous premiums to book value data by ycharts alphabet goog googl trades at the smallest premium of just 785 it would only have to fall 83 to trade at book value nvidia nvda trades at the largest premium to book value and would have to fall over 98 to reach book value ill go out on a limb and suggest that these kinds of collapses among these companies arent likely to happen while one might argue that certain types of companies are likely to trade closer to book value even those that some suggest should trade at book value often dont for example annaly capital nly is a mortgage reit that invests primarily in agency mortgagebacked securities agency mbs is a very liquid asset that you can buy directly through your brokerage account as a result many suggest that book value should be the prime measure of valuation historically nly has traded from 80 to 160 of book value data by ycharts since stock prices arent directly tied to book value 1share paid in dividends could be worth more or less than 1 in share price movement share prices move every day the value of a dividend in your pocket doesnt this isnt always a meaningful distinction if you are in a bullish stock market and prices are always going up then selling shares can result is very similar cash flows as a stock with identical returns that pays a dividend if shares are trading at large premiums then 1share on the balance sheet might generate far more than 1share in share price however when a bear market happens and everything in the market is trading at a significant discount receiving a dividend or selling shares can be the difference between you destroying your portfolio and coasting through the bear market this is due to sequence of returns risk the magic of sequence of returns im going to show you a magic trick here is a chart of annaly capital nly compared to invesco qqq trust qqq and the sp 500 from april 1999 through june 26 2024 portfolio visualizer on a 1000000 original investment qqq more than doubled in the following year before the dotcom bubble burst causing it to underperform from 2002 through 2024 qqq caught back up and outperformed nly portfolio visualizer so if you could go back in a time machine and had to choose one of these holdings to buy and hold no matter what qqq would be your choice right after all it ends with an extra 13 million in value who doesnt want an extra 13 million now for the magic trick the same time period the same tickers with one small change you see the investor with 1 million in 1999 likely felt very good about retiring 1 million is still a good bit of money today but in 1999 if you were a millionaire people thought you were set for life so if that investor retired and started withdrawing 40000year indexed to inflation aka the 4 rule here is what that looks like portfolio visualizer nly goes from slightly underperforming to dramatically outperforming the investor in qqq using the 4 withdrawal rule has to be extremely concerned they have 129564 left from the original 1 million and the 4 rule prescribes withdrawing over 75000 in 2024 something that clearly could not be done safely meanwhile the nly investor has 65 million in share value income of over 765000 in 2023 and is withdrawing less than 10 of the income to meet the target withdrawal portfolio visualizer how can such a relatively small withdrawal cause such an enormous difference lets go back to where the wheels came off and look at the annual returns in the early years pay attention to the value of qqq in 2000 through 2001 without withdrawals portfolio visualizer now compare the same numbers with cash being withdrawn portfolio visualizer the withdrawals caused the qqq position to be worth 215 less by 2002 than it would have been if the funds stayed invested in essence the investor was forced to sell shares at poor prices so by 2007 without withdrawals qqq was able to fully recover and survive the great financial crisis with withdrawals it was only able to recover to 489k and in 2008 it was at 234k while withdrawals were approaching 51k forcing the selling of even more shares at low prices tell me again how selling shares is no different than dividends selling low destroys capital its math if you are selling shares at low prices then when the price recovers you will hold fewer shares and therefore it will take more upside to get you back to even with an income approach where the amount of dividends you receive is greater than your withdrawals you are buying more shares when prices are low the fastest way to devastate your retirement portfolio is to be forced to sell when prices are low the income method is a strategy designed to avoid ever being forced to sell shares to withdraw income this way you can decide to sell on your own time at good prices note that dividend investments are not magic they do not guarantee that you will get a particular dividend indefinitely they can perform exceptionally well or poorly dividends can be cut raised or even suspended also if you withdraw more cash than is produced by your dividends you may be forced to sell shares at poor prices creating the same problem qqq had above a wellconstructed income investment strategy incorporates these risks this is why we recommend having a diversified portfolio of at least 42 incomeproducing investments rather than all your investments in a single ticker we recommend an allocation to fixedincome which tends to be more stable finally we suggest planning on reinvesting at least 25 of your dividend income both to provide a source of income growth and also to provide a buffer in the event that we see a period of higher than average dividend cuts what dividends are not dividends are not magic money conjured out of thin air they are payments paid by a company or fund to shareholders those payments come from cash that the company or fund acquires where does the company or fund get that cash it can vary it can vary for the same company across different payments cash on hand sometimes a company might have excess cash sitting on their balance sheet operating cash flow many companies will pay dividends from the cash that is generated by their operations various nongaap metrics often aim to measure the amount of recurring cash flow being produced by the companys operations these include ffo funds from operations affo adjusted funds from operations fad funds available for distribution and cad cash available for distribution these metrics can often be a fantastic way to estimate the sustainability of a dividend however be aware that even if the metric carries the same name the calculation may vary from company to company it is essential that you look at the reconciliation to gaap earnings so that you understand what adjustments have been made if comparing two different companies make your own adjustments so that the metrics are comparable investment income some businesses primarily make money through investments mortgage reits or bdcs are examples of companies that generate most of their earnings through investments capital gains capital gains can be sources of cash that is eventually distributed in many cases large capital gains are a source of onetime special dividends however for other investments it might be a recurring part of their strategy for example cefs closedend funds are required to distribute most of their realized capital gains so if you invest in a cef you can expect a significant portion of your dividends to stem from capital gains borrowing a company might borrow money usually on its revolver to fund a dividend payment raising capital companies can raise cash from issuing common or preferred equity when evaluating a dividendpaying investment it is critical that we take the time to understand the business model of the company and where its dividends are going to be paid from obviously we want to avoid companies that are funding their dividends primarily through temporary or unsustainable sources like borrowing unless we have a very clear picture for how they will achieve coverage in the future there is no shortcut using a metric to screen investments to narrow down the number of options you want to do a deep dive on can be helpful however you cannot rely on headline metrics to tell you how a dividend is being paid and whether or not it is safe there are always numerous things going on within a company they might be increasing their overall debt level to expand but the dividend is comfortably covered by existing operations or a company might have significant capital gains that wont be recurring making the dividend appear covered when it wont be in the long run conclusion dividends arent magic but they are capable of performing a very incredible magic trick they can prevent you from being forced to sell shares during a market downturn share prices are volatile and they can often have very little to do with the underlying business for those of us who are not forced to sell shares the volatility of share prices is an advantage we get to choose on any particular day whether we want to be a buyer or a seller for those who are forced to sell shares the volatility of market prices is a great risk selling shares at poor prices is the greatest threat to a retirement portfolio unfortunately it is something that many find themselves doing out of fear or necessity an incomebased strategy can help deal with some of the complications created by volatile prices we have a tangible measure of what we are getting paid just like with your job you know exactly how much you got paid live on less im not going to tell you i have the secret code to avoid losses life isnt a video game there is no cheat code anyone who tells you they have a way to guarantee you make x without a risk of loss buyer beware what i will tell you is that if you take time to approach the market in a reasoned and logical manner it can be a great generator of wealth for you you will need to keep a level head avoid panicking and work to identify the best investment options for your goals focus on what the companies do and how they generate cash to pay the dividend make your best estimate as to whether or not they will be able to continue to do that sometimes you might be wrong and that is ok focus on building your income and make sure you are withdrawing less maintain a cushion of excess dividends and if that cushion shrinks that is a warning sign for you to change things in your portfolio the greatest benefit of an income strategy is that you are not faced with the decision that so many had to make in 20012002 on whether or not it was safe to withdraw funds since you arent spending money until it is paid to you you know the budget you have to work with and you know if you need to do something to either increase your income or reduce your spending before it is too late more often than not investors who take an income approach to the market will be surprised at just how much income their portfolio is capable of producing they often get to enjoy the magical feeling that comes with having a lot of cash flow,,,,,,,,Very Old

infrastructure applications and logs through unified dashboards that streamlined approach helps them spot potential problems before they become more serious issues pagerdutys platform helps it professionals quickly respond to major incidents by organizing their oncall schedules escalation policies and alert mechanisms datadog and pagerduty both went public in 2019 datadogs stock has surged 388 since its ipo but pagerduty still trades about 8 below its debut price lets see why the proactive player outperformed the reactive one by such a wide margin image source getty images how fast is datadog growing datadogs revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 67 from 2019 to 2022 while its number of large customers which generated at least 100000 in annual recurring revenue arr more than tripled but in 2023 its revenue only rose 27 as its large customer base grew 15 its net dollarbased retention rate which stayed above 130 in all of 2022 slipped to the mid110s by the end of 2023 like many of its industry peers datadog attributed that deceleration to the macro headwinds that drove many companies to rein in their cloud spending but on the bright side it turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis in 2023 as it trimmed its expenses looking ahead datadog still faces fierce competition from similar platforms like ciscos appdynamics dynatrace new relic logicmonitor microsofts azure monitor and ibms instana its core market is also maturing the global observability tools and platform market might only expand at a cagr of 117 from 2023 to 2028 according to markets and markets from 2023 to 2026 analysts expect datadogs revenue to grow at a cagr of 25 as its gaap eps increases at a cagr of 85 those growth rates are impressive but its stock isnt cheap at 78 times its forward adjusted earnings and 17 times this years sales thats probably why datadogs only advanced about 9 this year and why its insiders sold slightly more shares than they bought over the past 12 months how fast is pagerduty growing from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023 which ended in january 2023 pagerdutys revenue rose at a cagr of 30 as its total number of paying customers grew 20 its still unprofitable on a gaap basis but its nongaap earnings turned positive in 2023 story continues but in fiscal 2024 pagerdutys revenue only grew 16 as its total number of paying customers declined 1 its dollarbased retention rate slipped to 107 in the fourth quarter compared to 120 a year earlier like datadog it seems to be struggling with the tough macro headwinds for the cloud software market but it also operates in a crowded market filled with bigger competitors like ciscos splunk and the digital workflow services leader servicenow from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 analysts expect pagerdutys revenue to increase at cagr of only 12 as its adjusted earnings grow at a cagr of 20 to put that into perspective servicenow generated more than 20 times as much revenue as pagerduty last year but its expected to grow its revenue at a cagr of 21 from 2023 to 2026 servicenow is also firmly profitable on a gaap basis based on those lackluster estimates pagerdutys stock isnt cheap at 33 times forward earnings and 5 times this years sales thats probably why its stock still trades at discount to its ipo price however its insiders have still been net buyers over the past year and ark invests cathie wood has been accumulating more shares in recent months the better buy datadog datadogs stock might tread water at these levels until its revenue growth and retention rates stabilize but it seems to have a much brighter future than pagerduty pagerduty needs to meaningfully widen its moat and grow faster than its larger competitors again before

believe that to achieve outsize returns its necessary to find undertheradar businesses that can grow rapidly but this just isnt true compelling investment ideas could be hiding in plain sight theres one fantastic company whose shares have catapulted 1090 higher in the past decade this enterprise is currently valued at greater than 2 trillion but i believe it still deserves a closer look heres the ultimate growth stock to buy with 1000 right now which would afford you five shares secular trends the business in question is none other than amazon nasdaq amzn the tech titan is one of the most wellknown companies on earth despite its scale as exemplified by trailing12month revenue of 591 billion there is still meaningful growth potential in the years ahead thanks to multiple secular tailwinds with a whopping 38 share of all online retail sales in the us amazon is the clear leader in the ecommerce space this has been true for a long time the business sells virtually every product category you can think of a far cry from the days when all it offered was books according to the federal reserve bank of st louis 84 of retail spending in this country is still represented by brickandmortar shopping amazon is in a prime position to benefit as online shopping increases its penetration rate over time another growth area is streaming entertainment the decline of traditional cable tv bundles has made way for new ondemand services to flourish with amazon prime video which has more than 200 million members the company has a top competitor in the socalled streaming wars prime video also gives amazon a hand in the digital ad industry given that the popular amazoncom site attracts billions of visitors each month the business has opportunities to monetize this attention via advertising revenue while alphabet and meta platforms currently dominate the digital ad market amazon is in the third position in terms of revenue share the company should see healthy sales growth for a long time as it benefits from longterm tailwinds in the ecommerce streaming and digital ad industries investing in ai astute readers will notice that a crucial segment still hasnt been discussed and thats amazon web services aws the companys cloud computing segment that commands industryleading market share its important to understand that the shift of businesses spending more money on offpremises tech infrastructure will continue to propel amazon story continues aws is a major growth engine as sales were up 17 in the first quarter of 2024 ended march 31 moreover its an extremely profitable segment reporting an outstanding operating margin of 376 in q1 the entire companys profitability can mostly be attributed to aws this division also positions amazon favorably in the artificial intelligence ai race i believe that ai regardless of how much excitement there seems to be wont necessarily create groundbreaking new products and services instead i think ai can bolster existing offerings that companies already provide to their customers by more aggressively leaning into ai innovation and capabilities aws is poised to become an even more missioncritical partner to its client base with plans to invest 100 billion in data centers over the next 10 years to expand ai capacity the business is positioning itself for lasting success what about the valuation despite amazons monster performance historically which has surely made some investors rich the stock still looks reasonably valued today this might be surprising to market observers who believe they might have missed the boat the companys market cap is about 20 times the companys estimated 2026 free cash flow fcf of about 100 billion because of the likelihood that fcf is poised to grow for many years

A0420,2024-07-07,309,Stitch Fix: Short-Term Pop Won't Fix Longer Term Issues (NASDAQ:SFIX),Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702726-stitch-fix-short-term-pop-wont-fix-longer-term-issues?source=feed_all_articles,photosomniae via getty images wall street loves a good rebound story but the critical question is if turnarounds can be sustained one of the stocks that surprised us over the past month is stitch fix nasdaqsfix the ecommerce company that used to be known for sending its customers a box of five stylistcurated items called fixes from which customers selected their favorites and sent the rest back when the novelty of this approach receded and especially amid weaker consumer spending postpandemic stitch fix started to tank but an earlyjune fiscal q3 april quarter earnings print started to reverse the story and stitch fix has now rallied from its ytd lows and is up nearly 10 year to date data by ycharts but again we have to ask critically is the company capable of retaining this rally in my view the answer is no i last wrote a bearish note on stitch fix in april when the stock was trading in the 2 range and while i certainly didnt foresee the postq3 earnings pop i am standing by my sell rating on this stock as a plethora of short and longterm risks have emerged stitch fix primarily popped on the companys outlook for q4 stitch fix q4 outlook stitch fix q3 earnings materials for q4 as shown above the company has guided to revenue declining only 14 to 12 yy which is a sequential improvement from a 16 decline in q3 and a 18 decline in the preceding q2 the midpoint of the companys guidance range of 317 million is 10 million or 3 points of growth better than wall streets 3066 million initial expectations that being said we have to recall how stitch fix is getting there earlier this year the company noted that it would be throwing all of its resources behind improving customer retention through a combination of both heavier marketing spend plus increasing customers touchpoints with its human stylists all of these efforts are going to be costly and as reflected in the guidance the company is expecting only a 1631 adjusted ebitda margin the midpoint of which is lower than 27 in the prior year q4 and the peak 40 margin that stitch fix hit in 2021 the company is effectively eroding the gross margin benefits its gaining from selling a higher mix of private label items by spending more on sales outreach here are several other core risks to be mindful of here stitch fixs unique elements have lost their novelty is it just a fad now the idea of getting a fix of five items and keeping only what you like was the whole selling point

on the retail scene amid basic convenience buyers its unclear where stitch fix fits in uniqlo zara and a number of upstart directtoconsumer brands have exploded on the retail scene amid basic convenience buyers its unclear where stitch fix fits in losing customers despite higher marketing spend despite stitch fixs efforts to draw more customers in it keeps bleeding active clients steer clear here stitch fix is very likely to unwind its recent rally q3 download to me despite the aboveexpectations guidance in q4 the companys actual results in q3 did little to inspire continued confidence in this name take a look at the q3 earnings summary below stitch fix q3 results stitch fix q3 earnings materials revenue declined 16 yy to 3227 million which beat wall streets expectations of 3062 million 20 yy by a fourpoint margin revenue growth did accelerate two points from a 18 yy decline in q2 but we also have to note that the companys comps are getting easier as we are lapping very weak sales in 2023 meanwhile stitch fixs core problem of losing clients has continued to feature prominently the q3 ending client count was 263 million down 20 yy and representing a loss of 172k clients from q2 alone stitch fix q3 customer metrics stitch fix q3 earnings materials and we also point out that this is in spite of stitch fix spending 53 of its revenue on selling general and administrative expenses five points higher than 48 in the yearago quarter and 9 on advertising two points higher than 7 in the yearago quarter which more than nullified three points of higher gross margins from a higher mix of private label sales there are small product tests that the company is running to try to improve results one new initiative is quick fixes which gives customers the optionality to add a second fix upon checkout ceo matt baer noted that this effort has helped to boost average order values on the q3 earnings call in q3 we leveraged our analytics capabilities to improve the profitability of fixed transactions while strengthening client satisfaction following a robust analysis of client interactions we found opportunities to reduce underperforming shipments as an example we currently offer quick fixes which provide clients the option to schedule an additional fix immediately following checkout utilizing our proprietary demand algorithms we improve the performance of quick fix’s by only offering them to clients when we know the new fixes have a high likelihood of success within three weeks of this change quick fix average order value improved by 25 that said new initiatives plus the companys heightened expense on advertising has cut sharply into profitability adjusted ebitda declined 50 yy to 7 million as shown in the chart below while adjusted ebitda margins of 21 were 140bps weaker yy stitch fix adjusted ebitda stitch fix q3 earnings materials key takeaways with stitch fixs customer base continuing to recede despite heavier efforts in advertising i continue to be wary of stitch fix despite the stocks recent rebound in confidence longer term i find it very difficult to believe that the company can compete in a world of much larger

inc nyseayi should deliver good revenue growth in the coming quarters thanks to its healthy backlog and improved order pipeline in the infrastructure business further the company’s revenue growth should benefit from its expansion into new verticals like refueling stations and horticulture in addition the company’s focus on product vitality and innovation should contribute to volume growth and improve pricingmix on the margin front the company’s margins should benefit from operating leverage on higher sales product vitality initiatives and marginaccretive acquisitions further the full integration of the optotronics business should also contribute to margin growth while i like the company’s growth prospects i can’t say the same for its valuation the stock has seen a 50 increase since my previous bullish article and is trading in line with its historical averages on consensus fy25 pe i believe the company’s growth prospects are already reflected in the stock so i am moving to the sidelines and rating ayi neutral revenue analysis and outlook over the last few quarters the company has been seeing downbeat revenue trends due to macroeconomic headwinds and challenges from difficult yy comparisons in its acuity brands lighting and lighting controls abl segment in the third quarter of 2024 the abl segment also faced some labor shortagerelated issues that impacted the company’s ability to meet production targets as a result the segment saw a yy decline in sales across its independent sales network direct sales network retail sales and oem and other channels this decline more than offset sales growth in its corporate accounts which benefitted from a large retail relight project and much easier comparisons as it lapped last year’s 249 decline on the other hand the intelligent spaces group isg segment’s sales grew by 15 yy driven by higher sales of distech products and contribution from the acquisition of ke2 therm on a consolidated basis the company’s net sales declined by 32 yy to 9681 million as sales decline in the abl segment more than offset higher sales in the isg segment ayi’s historical revenue growth company data gs analytics research looking forward i am optimistic about the company’s revenue growth outlook on its last earnings call management noted that the company’s order rates consistently exceeded shipments last quarter resulting in a healthy backlog growth further the company also noted increased quoting activity particularly in the infrastructure sector which indicates a healthy order pipeline this backlog growth and improved order pipeline should translate into good sales growth in the coming quarters as management addresses labor shortages and related production issues the company is also expanding into new verticals such as refueling stations and horticulture where there is a good demand for sustainable and efficient lighting solutions further the company continues to expand its solutions from intelligent spaces business across geographies last quarter the company continued to add system integrator capability in the uk australia and asia as a part of geographic expansion in my last article i mentioned acuity’s focus on product vitality and innovation to be a key revenue driver in the medium to long run the company has continued to introduce new and improved products such as lithonia frame and advanced lighting solutions from alight luminis and eureka the company’s acquisition of optotronics a few years ago also has given it more control of technology in its luminaries and provided significant flexibility both in design and operations driving innovation in addition to helping volumes the company’s focus on innovation should also help the company in terms of pricingmix margin analysis and outlook in q3 2024 despite a 32 yy net sales decline the company saw a 200 bps yy increase in gross margin to 467 and a 100 bps yy increase in adjusted operating margin to 173 this increase was attributed to product vitality initiatives effective pricecost management and productivity gains which more than offset the impact of lower net sales and higher production costs on a segment basis the abl and isg segments grew adjusted operating margin by 100 bps yy and 340 bps yy respectively ayi’s adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin company data gs analytics research ayi’s segmentwise adjusted operating margin company data gs analytics research looking forward i am optimistic about the company’s margin improvement prospects the company’s revenue outlook is positive and the company’s margins should benefit from operating leverage due to increasing sales the company’s margins should also benefit from the product vitality initiatives as the newimproved products usually command better pricing and margins further the company has fully integrated the optotronics business acquired a few years back which should enable it to have more flexibility both in design and operation this vertical integration should also improve margins the company has also been implementing a bolton acquisition strategy and acquiring a highmargin business ke2 therm is a good example i expect management to continue implementing this strategy which should help improve the margin mix in the long run valuation and rating ayi stock is trading at 1541x fy24 consensus eps estimate of 1552 and 1454x fy25 eps estimate of 1645 over the last 5 years the stock has traded at an average forward pe of 1447x ayi consensus eps estimates seeking alpha while the companys fy24 pe is at a premium to its historical valuations its fy25 pe is almost in line many of the electrical components and equipment companies like eaton etn and hubbell hubb are trading at a premium to their historical valuations these days one reason behind this premium is they supply components related to data centers or grid resiliency and their endmarket demand is benefiting from secular megatrends however acuity brands is primarily into lighting products and is not as exposed to some of those secular themes so i dont think its pe multiple can rerate meaningfully above historical levels further the company imports 15 of its finished products and some of the raw components to manufacture its products from asia with elections approaching there is a good chance of debate around import tariffs reigniting which might keep some pressure on ayis valuation multiple this is another reason why i dont see much probability of pe multiple rerating from these levels with the companys eps expected to grow around 67 over the next couple of years consensus estimates i believe the stock can give midsingledigit cagr assuming pe remains constant this is not enough for me to give a buy rating last year when i covered the stock with a buy rating it was trading at a meaningful discount to its historical levels however the stock has given over 50 upside since then after this meaningful price appreciation i believe that the current valuations appropriately reflect the companys prospects hence i am downgrading my rating to neutral takeaway i am optimistic about the company’s revenue and

parliamentary runoff election on sunday that will reconfigure the political landscape with opinion polls forecasting the farright national rally rn will win the most votes but likely fall short of a majority such an outcome could plunge the country into a chaotic hung parliament severely denting the authority of president emmanuel macron equally if the nationalist eurosceptic rn did win a majority the probusiness proeurope president could find himself forced into a difficult cohabitation marine le pens rn scored historic gains to win last sundays firstround vote raising the spectre of frances first farright government since world war two but after centrist and leftist parties joined forces over the past week in a bid to forge an antirn barricade le pens hopes of the rn winning an absolute majority in the 577seat national assembly seem less certain polls suggest the rn will become the dominant legislative force but fail to reach the 289seat majority that le pen and her 28yearold protégé jordan bardella believe would allow them to claim the prime ministers job and drag france sharply rightward polls open at 8 am 0600 gmt and close at 6 pm in towns and small cities and 8 pm 1800 gmt in larger cities with initial projections expected the moment voting ends based on partial counts from a sample of polling stations much will depend on whether voters follow the calls of leading antirn alliances to block the far right from power or support farright contenders raphael glucksmann a member of the european parliament who led frances leftist ticket in last months european vote said he viewed sundays runoff as a simple referendum on whether the le pen family takes over this country france is on the cliffedge and we dont know if were going to jump he told france inter radio last week a longtime pariah for many due to its history of racism and antisemitism the rn has increased its support on the back of voter anger at macron straitened household budgets and immigration concerns french people have a real desire for change le pen told tf1 tv on wednesday adding that she was very confident of securing a parliamentary majority even if the rn falls short it

political allies and supporters when he called the snap election after a humbling by the rn in last months european parliamentary vote hoping to wrongfoot his rivals in a legislative election whatever the final result his political agenda now appears dead three years before the end of his presidency bardella says the rn would decline to form a government if it doesnt win a majority although le pen has said it might try if it falls just short prime minister gabriel attal who looks likely to lose his job in the postelection shakeup has dismissed suggestions macrons centrists could seek to form a crossparty government in the event of a hung parliament instead he would like moderates to pass legislation on a casebycase basis an rn majority would force macron into an awkward cohabitation with bardella as prime minister with thorny constitutional tussles and questions on the international stage about who really speaks for france if the rn is deprived of a majority and declines to form a government modernday france would find itself in uncharted territory coalition building would be difficult for any of the blocs given the policy differences between them french assets have risen on expectations the rn wont win a majority with banking shares up and the risk premium investors demand to hold french debt narrowing economists question whether the rns hefty spending plans are fully funded an rnled government would raise major questions over where the european union is headed given frances powerful role in the bloc although eu laws are almost certain to restrict its plans to crack down on immigration for many in frances immigrant and minority communities the rns ascent has already sent a clear and unwelcoming message they hate muslims they hate islam said 20yearold cinema student selma bouziane at a market in goussainville a town near paris they see islam as a scapegoat for all of frances problems so its bound to be negative for the muslim community the rn pledges to reduce immigration loosen legislation to expel illegal migrants and tighten rules around family reunification le pen says she is not antiislam but that immigration is out of control and too many

emmanuel macrons together ensemble alliance and the leftwing new popular front nfp have called on voters to reject the party in the second round and have withdrawn candidates in many constituencies where another candidate was better placed to beat the rn by offering voters a starker choice and fewer candidates rns opponents hope that the electorate will opt for the nonrn candidate analysts predict that national rally — the nationalist antiimmigrant and euroskeptic party led by 28yearold jordan bardella and party figurehead marine le pen — is now less likely to be able to achieve an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577seat national assembly but is still likely to gather the most votes marine le pen and jordan bardella at the final rally before the june 9 european parliament

aim of making it substantially more difficult for the rn to obtain an absolute majority still its unclear how voters will react to a being told who to vote for by the political establishment b being asked to vote for party candidates they might instinctively oppose and c to mixed messages from political leaders who are now telling them to vote for rival candidates they were disparaging just a few days ago in the campaign race several senior figures from the promacron camp have provided different suggestions on what their voters should do antonio barroso deputy director of research at consultancy teneo said in a note wednesday for instance former prime minister edouard philippe has said voters should vote neither for the rn nor candidates from the farleft france unbowed lfi party at the same time current prime minister gabriel attal has called for everyone to vote against the rn an opinion poll published by ifop on july 3 suggested voters might tend toward the centrist promacron or leftwing candidate rather than the rn candidate if that was the choice they were presented with on the ballot paper if the choice was between a farleft and farright candidate however the picture was more nuanced showing a split vote teneos barroso also sounded a note of caution that the poll data related to attitudes at the national level ignoring the local dynamics in each constituency what could happen the first poll to be published after the creation of a crossparty antirn alliance showed rn and its allies would get 190 to 220 seats far short of the 289 needed for a majority the harris interactive poll for challenges magazine published wednesday and reported by reuters also showed that the centerright republicans were likely to win 3050 seats meaning that even in the bestcase scenario a rightwingled minority government would be hard to form the harris poll showed that the leftist nfp alliance would win 159 to 183 seats while macrons together alliance would win

in the event of a hung parliament prime minister gabriel attal suggested this week that moderates in the national assembly could work together to pass legislation on a casebycase basis but little else has been said on the matter as parties focus on maximizing their own vote share political analysis by teneo assesses the chance of a hung parliament is at 35 a result it said would not allow it to negotiate an alliance with other parties in this situation such a scenario would be the most uncertain one as there would be no easy solution leading to the formation of a government prime minister gabriel attal has suggested that the republican forces in the national assembly ie nonrn parties could coalesce to support a government however such a coalition would be difficult to assemble given the differences between the parties policy preferences teneo believed there was a 35 chance rn will get close to an absolute majority in which case its likely marine le pen would try to court mps from

A0434,2024-07-07,309,"Nvidia will win the race to a $4 trillion market cap—but the long-term big tech battle might be different, experts say",Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/07/nvidia-win-race-4-trillion-market-cap-big-tech-outlook-google-microsoft-amazon-apple/,a surprisingly resilient economy and profitfilled ai boom are driving the united states’ big tech giants toward a milestone that would have seemed impossible just a few decades ago nvidia microsoft apple have all surpassed the 3 trillion market capitalization mark and google and amazon are following close behind in the 2 trillion range combined these five tech giants alone are now worth more than 145 trillion and make up roughly 32 of the sp 500 for reference in 2002 after the dotcom bubble burst the total market capitalization of every us stock was 111 trillion according to siblis research data big tech’s performance has been particularly impressive this year with nvidia for example surging from a 2 trillion market cap to a 3 trillion market cap in under 100 days that begs the question which tech giant will hit the next big milestone 4 trillion in market cap first some bears argue that big tech companies’ record run of performance can’t continue forever given their elevated valuations and the slowing economy while the bulls believe this is just the beginning of a streak of aiinduced wins for big tech “i think a year from now we will have three 4 trillion market cap companies nvidia apple microsoft” wedbush tech analyst dan ives told fortune he argued that many of his peers on wall street continue to underestimate the ai revolution and the health of the us economy “unless you have a telescope you can’t find a recession and the fed their next move is a cut not a hike so to me all signs are bullish” he said “it’s 9 pm and the party goes to 4 am…the haters will hate continuing to say that this is a bubble” nvidia there are of course a wide range of views on where big tech companies are headed but many experts are convinced that chip giant nvidia will be the first to reach the 4 trillion market cap mark driven by the seemingly unending thirst for its aienabling hardware “the first one to get there is likely to be the godfather of ai jensen huang and nvidia because they’re the only game in town—their gpus are the new oil or gold in the tech world with no real competition” ives said nvidia stock has surged roughly 160 year to date and more than 3000 over the past five years that’s led some analysts to warn that the tech giant’s valuation has become stretched and doesn’t account for rising competition in the semiconductor market as david trainer founder and ceo of research firm new constructs told fortune’s shawn tully last month “nvidia’s valuation is ridiculous it’s facing the same curse as tesla but when tesla got profitable loads of competitors entered the ev space cutting margins and slowing sales the same will happen with nvidia” but ives noted that even though nvidia’s shares have surged its revenues and earnings have followed suit nvidia raked in a record 26 billion in revenues and 148 billion in net income in the quarter that ended this april in 2021 during the same quarter the company had revenues of just 58 billion and net income of 19 billion louis navellier founder and chairman of family office navellier associates also brushed off the competition argument claiming nvidia essentially has a “monopoly” on key ai chips which will lead to consistent sales and earnings growth for years to come “and you know jensen is kind of like the new elon he’s got kind of a cult status” he said adding that will continue to drive retail investors in the stock nvidia’s market capitalization as of july 5 314 trillion microsoft microsoft’s booming cloud business and big investment into chatgpt creator openai have buoyed its shares over the past few years but it’s the company’s diverse and sustainable revenue streams that will lead it to a 4 trillion market cap according to tim pagliara founder and chief investment officer of independent wealth management firm capwealth he said nvidia may briefly touch the 4 trillion milestone first due to what he called the current ai “mania” but microsoft will be the “more sustainable” 4 trillion company “theyre embracing ai but they also have just a tremendous number of things in the pipeline and i know as a small business owner we just gladly keep paying them more per user per month for everything from azure to some of the additional add ons that they have created for security and things like that” he added referencing microsoft’s azure cloud computing business pagliara thinks microsoft’s big tech rivals have riskier business models as well apple is dependent on consumers buying into its new iphone offerings every few years and nvidia is benefiting from a lack of competition in the near term he said meanwhile microsoft has multiple avenues for consistent revenue growth from the azure cloud business and office 365 to windows and linkedin market cap 348 trillion apple when it comes to a longerterm outlook apple is high on many analysts’ lists because of its potential to use ai to get customers to upgrade their current phones and lure in more iphone customers it may not be the first to reach a 4 trillion market cap but it will get there soon these bulls say “i think over the next two three years the largest market cap that we will see is apple because they have 22 billion ios devices” ives predicted “consumer ai is going to go through the walls for cupertino—they are only in the beginning of an aidriven supercycle” louis navellier was also optimistic about apple’s future but he said it will need a few “little breakthroughs” to get more customers to buy new iphones he pointed to new ai tools and the potential for folding iphones as examples “i dont know if theyre going to announce that in september but if they do it will be a 2500 phone and it will sell like crazy and send that stock soaring” market cap 346 trillion what about alphabet and amazon the google parent’s market cap is currently 236 trillion leaving it well shy of the 4 trillion mark analysts said alphabet will be able to capitalize on the ai revolution but its missteps with hallucinations have left it behind and its cloud business isn’t performing as well as others however the search giant is taking talent from its peers in an attempt to catch up recent reports have shown it’s a similar story for amazon which just recently passed the 2 trillion milestone and experts expect it will take time for share prices to nearly double wedbush’s ives argued that amazon’s cloud business aws has also lost out to microsoft “​​i think there was some hubris in underestimating what nadella and microsoft are doing and with the crosstown rivals and in that 206 area code its been a bit of a gut punch for amazon” he said and when it comes to ai amazon is just “behind the eightball” too according to the veteran tech analyst however ives noted that ceo andy jassy has made changes to the company’s cloud business and with a massive base of customers amazon should benefit more from ai moving forward to be sure every tech giant on this list also faces risks antitrust regulations cyber attacks a slowing economy and a reduction in ai spending should all be considered but for now the bulls remain bullish–and they think you should be too “the tech bears with their spreadsheets and valuations will stay in hibernation mode” ives said “but when everyone meets for breakfast at 6 am after this ai party the bulls will have won and the bears just sound smart”,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0435,2024-07-07,309,Struggles at Belfast’s Titanic shipyard reflect UK’s faded naval power,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/07/struggles-at-belfasts-titanic-shipyard-reflect-uks-faded-naval-power,the harland wolff hw shipyard in belfast is famous for having built the titanic the largest passenger ship of its time before it hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage across the atlantic but things have moved on since 1912 in recent weeks samson one of the two yellow gantry cranes that dominate belfast’s skyline has been straddling a giant oil processing vessel this is the canadianowned searose which is being upgraded by hw in a contract worth more than £90m the searose is even larger than the titanic weighing in at 150000 tonnes the sight of a massive ship in belfast harbour recalls the city’s glory days as a shipbuilding superpower hw collapsed into administration in 2019 but now the shipyard is back at the centre of british hopes to restore something of the industry’s past glories those hopes now appear to be under threat as hw waits for keir starmer’s government to decide whether to proceed with a controversial £16bn deal that would see the small aimlisted company given a £200m loan guarantee completely underwritten by the uk taxpayer it has six months to find new money to replace previous debts the yard’s travails illustrate the gap between the uk’s pretensions to be a major military power and the reality in the industry for all its herculean endeavours hw is a minnow valued at only £145m before its shares were suspended last week after it failed to file accounts on time britain once had the most powerful navy in the world – albeit one built to sustain an empire rather than for defence – and even during the falklands war in 1982 it could muster 23 destroyers and frigates it now has 17 plus two aircraft carriers the days of naval supremacy are long gone but the uk is still a midranking military power with a nuclear arsenal a permanent seat on the un security council and a pledge to spend 25 of gdp on defence view image in fullscreen bae systems is building royal navy frigates in govan near glasgow photograph iain mastertonalamy in may grant shapps who was defence secretary until the general election hailed a “new golden age for british shipbuilding” with six new warships to be built in the uk with another 22 military vessels already in the pipeline most of the ships will be built by the uk’s two dominant naval shipbuilders with type 26 frigates being made by bae systems in govan and scotstoun near glasgow and type 31 frigates by babcock international at rosyth near edinburgh bae also builds submarines for the royal navy at barrowinfurness in cumbria however the programme also includes three “fleet solid support” ships which carry ammunition and other supplies to aircraft carriers that £16bn contract has been awarded to a consortium of hw spain’s stateowned shipbuilder navantia and british design firm bmt the government said the contract would create 900 shipyard jobs in belfast plus another 300 at a yard in appledore devon bought by hw’s owner infrastrata in 2020 after it closed in 2019 made in belfast hundreds of new jobs will provide a huge morale boost for belfast but the city will still be a long way from reliving its former glories in the 19th century belfast’s growth matched anything seen in england’s northern industrial cities according to graham brownlow senior lecturer in economics at queen’s university belfast the city’s population rose from 75000 in 1841 to 387000 in 1911 and by 1914 hw had 14000 employees this rapid growth was he says an early example of what is now known as industrial strategy with the city’s harbour commission reclaiming land to build docks john parker the veteran industrialist who now chairs builder laing o’rourke joined hw as an apprentice in the late 1950s when it ran the largest single shipyard in the world building on 19 slipways at a time “it was just the most massive operation” and “an amazing training ground” said parker who went on to become chief executive from 198393 yet from the late 1960s international competition surged and northern ireland’s troubles took a lot of energy out of the city the ship now under the belfast cranes the searose was built in south korea which together with china and japan dominates global nonmilitary shipbuilding making 94 of the world’s merchant fleet according to un figures “the collapse of uk shipbuilding wasn’t because of a lack of local tonnage being produced” said brownlow “it was because the share of tonnage was falling as the rest of the world caught up” view image in fullscreen the samson and goliath cranes at the harland wolff shipyard photograph paul faithafpgetty images there’s very little chance of the uk which contributed no new ships to the merchant fleet in 2023 winning many commercial shipbuilding orders – barring perhaps a dramatic new technology to lower emissions so any british shipbuilding revival will have to rely on warships – plus perhaps contracts for maintenance repairs and upgrades that can be handled by smaller yards labour has promised a strategic defence review within its first year before it sets its spending priorities the party has already made some firm commitments on how it will spend the equivalent of 25 of gdp on defence including sticking closely to the conservatives’ plan to build four new nuclear submarines the review would look in detail at every large contract including the fleet solid support ships a party source said this will take time because security classifications mean opposition politicians like the general public see only the bare minimum of information about any defence deal none of that augurs well for the quick turnaround of the hw loan guarantee expected by chief executive john wood who claimed in may on social media that the general election would not delay the deal financial troubles view image in fullscreen harland and wolff workers protest at the yard’s threatened closure in 2019 photograph liam mcburneypa a threatened strike has been called off after the company reached a pay agreement with workers but if the loan guarantee is not given hw could be in trouble last monday the company blamed its share suspension on a dispute with auditors over when it could recognise revenues from future years and released unaudited figures showing it lost £43m in 2022 it also said “should there be any material delays to securing the facility post the general election the company’s ability to execute new and large contracts would be adversely affected” the situation is urgent because hw is carrying massive liabilities these include 115m £91m in loans agreed from march 2022 with riverstone credit management a private us lender which is charging it interest of more than 14 a year hw said it had made repayments and reported debt costs of £18m for 2023 the loan must be repaid by 31 december significant further delays to the uk loan guarantee would probably eat into the £77m hw earmarked for capital investments including new robotic welding machines and an expanded fabrication hall riverstone holds charges over hw’s key properties including appledore the main shipyard its leases of smaller yards in methil and arnish in scotland plus land off northern ireland’s coast related to a gas storage project this means that if hw defaults on its loans the yards could fall into the lender’s hands an hw spokesperson said “our number one priority is investing in our yards and people so that we can capitalise on the significant opportunities facing us including the landmark fleet solid support contract we have supportive financing partners and are progressing alternative solutions that are better suited to the longterm growth of our business “turnover has increased substantially with the completion of multiple projects and market forecasts are projecting a revenue line of £200m this financial year” whatever hw’s fate its struggles illustrate the difficulty of spreading warship construction work beyond the big scottish yards mps have raised concerns that much of the building may be carried out in navantia’s yard in cádiz spain with only superficial work being done in belfast and north devon trevor taylor professorial fellow at the royal united services institute thinktank said he believed it was technically feasible to spread some warship work to other uk yards – as recommended by parker in a 2016 report for government – because modern ships are built in blocks and then joined together the navy’s two queen elizabeth class aircraft carriers were built in blocks at seven yards across britain before being floated around the coast for assembly at rosyth north of edinburgh however taylor warned that the political attraction of revitalising belfast is matched by “risks in delivery” because of the need for funding if hw were to drop out one option would be to bring back the previously rejected consortium led by bae and birkenhead’s cammell laird shipyard both taylor and parker said the industry had withered to such an extent that companies such as hw would struggle to build a workforce with the right skills hw said this was “categorically not true” and that it had already increased its workforce from 46 to almost 1600 emma evans defence policy adviser at ads a lobby group for the uk defence industry said the government could change a “feast and famine approach to contracting which leads to a drain of skills and makes it very difficult for industry to train invest and retain skilled workers” for parker the prize of billions of pounds of economic value being spread across the uk is worth it “this can be a great source of economic growth” he said “belfast certainly needs that type of opportunity to create highly skilled jobs” marine adventures while hw’s main focus is now on shipbuilding the company and its chief executive have a history of unorthodox marine projects before buying the shipyard out of administration in 2019 and taking its famous name hw was called infrastrata it emerged out of a gas drilling company in 2008 and tried to frack for gas in northern ireland drawing the ire of avengersstarcumcampaigner mark ruffalo in the process it then pivoted to a project for storing gas in salt caverns at islandmagee on northern ireland’s east coast hw suffered a severe blow last month when belfast’s court of appeal ruled that government approval of the project had not been lawful the company said it was considering whether it could take its case to the supreme court wood joined infrastrata in 2018 having previously been a director of msc europe a southampton ship refitter that collapsed in 2007 reportedly owing suppliers £3m the company said that wood had since then “delivered multibillion contracts and run businesses delivering major programmes” after a stint managing ship repairs at bae systems and then working for consultancies he led

Now he must think again | William Keegan,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/07/keir-starmer-ruled-out-rejoining-the-eu-now-he-must-think-again,the first moves of a new prime minister can have lasting consequences when clement attlee went from being wartime deputy prime minister to labour prime minister in 1945 he had little alternative but to offer the nation the peacetime equivalent of churchill’s blood toil tears and sweat the age of austerity was born as the uk rebuilt its wartorn economy shortages necessarily involved rationing until a fully fledged peacetime economy could be restored the contrast with the conservativeliberal democrat policy of austerity from 2010 onwards could hardly have been starker post2010 austerity championed in particular by the then chancellor george osborne was founded on a false economic premise and on a rightwing approach to cutting back on previous rates of growth of public services in favour of tax cuts the false premise was that the financial crisis and rise in the budget deficit had been caused by labour’s putative overspending whereas the culprit had been the banking ­crisis absurd comparisons were made with the plight of the greek economy which was in much more serious trouble these were made the justification for austerity last week’s election result was in part the electorate’s reaction to the cumulative impact of the austerity programme austerity seems to have been a slow burner but by the time the hapless rishi sunak called what turned out to be a historic election one could hardly move without being told that the country was broken and nothing worked the examples that have stoked public anger are legion the strains on the nhs the state of the railways the overcrowded prisons the pollution of the rivers caused by the privatised water companies soaring poverty necessitating food banks – you name it there are many reasons why people expressed their frustration in the runup to last thursday keir starmer had several field days rubbing in the conservatives’ disgraceful record but he spent precious little time on what should be done about the brexit horrors which were superimposed on an economy already suffering from austerity i come back to my opening line and the lasting consequences of early action or inaction by new prime ministers a classic example of inaction with deleterious consequences came in 1964 when the newly elected harold wilson overruled his advisers and resisted their calls to devalue a patently overvalued pound the misalignment of the currency was hampering the export drive a series of sterling crises forced resort to deflationary measures which did no good to the government’s growth plans eventually devaluation was forced by the markets on

error is a decision which is likely to inhibit his growth plans with echoes of wilson in 1964 in this case however it was not his first major economic decision in government no he took it last week from what we might call a poll position which more or less guaranteed that he would be in government within a few days although starmer and his shadow chancellor rachel reeves had several times been dismissive about rejoining the single market and customs union many proeuropeans were hoping that this merely reflected starmer’s fear of upsetting socalled red wall voters who had deserted labour last time after all the press – especially the rightwing press – has been replete in recent months with examples of starmer changing his mind but last week the now prime minister dug in his heels saying he was ruling out rejoining the european single market in his lifetime “i’ve been really clear about not rejoining the eu the single market or the customs union or a return to freedom of movement” this at a time when the thinktank uk in a changing europe has concluded that labour’s existing plans to improve our trading relationship with europe will have “minimal” impact on reducing the huge and mounting costs of brexit and when the same thinktank finds that 78 – repeat 78 – of labour ­voters say they would vote for a return to the eu in labour’s manifesto the party commits itself to tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade if ever there were an unnecessary barrier to trade it is surely our exclusion from the european union don’t get me wrong the above is intended to be constructive ­criticism i admire starmer and happily join the chorus in ­marvelling at his achievement in making the labour party electable in such a short time this succession of dreadful conservative governments was crying out for its comeuppance but starmer has got to get his act together over the eu not in his lifetime in 1988 chancellor helmut kohl said that he did not expect german unification in his lifetime two years later germany was reunified,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0438,2024-07-07,309,QQQI: Opportunistic Way To Access Double Digit Yield Without Losing Upside Potential,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702741-qqqi-opportunistic-way-access-double-digit-yield-without-losing-upside-potential?source=feed_all_articles,torsten asmus neos nasdaq100r high income etf nasdaqqqqi is an actively managed etf focusing on the nasdaq 100 companies against which the etf managers sell and in some instances also buy call options to generate abnormal income qqqi is a relatively recently established etf end of january this year hence its assets under management figure is quite small just around 330 million in addition to this there is no long history available for qqqi that we could factor into our assessment if we look at how qqqi has performed since its inception we will notice two interesting dynamics that are reflected in the chart below ycharts first while qqqi has delivered strong doubledigit total return performance it has still lagged behind the pure play nasdaq 100 index this is only logical given that the etf employs some covered calls to enhance its yield level which in turn comes at a cost of foregone upside potential second if we isolate the return data from the distributed income streams we will notice that qqqi has still managed to register positive price appreciation at around 6 this is a rather significant level compared to what other covered call etfs typically record in their price performances ie usually the etf level remains flat and the lions share of the returns are explained only by the distributed income avenue with this in mind let me explain why i am bullish on qqqi thesis there are three fundamental reasons why i am bullish here the first is related to the current yield level which is very attractive as one might expect from yieldfocused etf structures the thing with qqqi is that if we look at the ttm dividend yield level we will arrive at a yield of circa 58 this is not a correct way to interpret this as such calculus is based on the past twelve months from which in five qqqi was operational so if we correct for this aspect and annualize the distribution levels received over the past 5month period we will get a yield that is closer to 15 in fact i would argue that such math underestimates the dividend growth potential as it is quite clear that in those 5 distribution data points there is a clear momentum in distributing gradually increasing current income streams so a yield at this is level could be easily deemed as one of the highest in the option driven etf space where the vehicle is structured so that the underlying portfolio is not synthetically created this leads us to the second reason why in my view qqqi is an attractive choice the reason lies in the fact that while qqqi is an option driven etf with a goal to capture abnormal income streams it does not stick only to covered call option strategy which inherently puts a massive cap on the upside potential instead qqqi employs an active or dynamic option strategy which could also include a presence of both buying and selling options against the underlying index ie the nasdaq 100 in this way investors can also potentially participate in the upside movements of the nasdaq 100 without losing the attractive income component just as we can observe it in the chart above another source of a magnified income is the process how qqqi takes advantage of tax loss harvesting by trading the ndx index options which are classified as section 1256 contract these are the contracts that are subject to lower tax rate regime as a result of this investors can access high yield that is also partially driven higher by more favorable taxation the third reason relates to the depressed volatility levels or the vix as for any etf which seeks to generate abnormal yield from option strategies higher volatility levels come in handy to really access attractive income this is especially true for etfs that mostly rely on selling options to pocket the premiums that could be then distributed as income without having to sell the underlying assets however as we can see in the chart below the vix is currently at rather depressed levels which should per definition imply cheaper call options ycharts even with such headwinds in place qqqi is still able to generate close to 15 in income in case the vix shot higher and remains there for some time it is extremely likely that qqqi would be able to accommodate more enticing current income streams in my opinion this is an embedded potential in qqqi to eventually benefit from rising vix and thus becoming an even higher yielding etf alternative the bottom line the essence of investing in qqqi lies in the combination of accessing abnormal yield in conjunction with some price appreciation potential that stems from the dynamically managed option strategy at the same time by investing in qqqi investors effectively can go long the underlying index the nasdaq 100 which is comprised of high growth names thus offering incremental returns from the partially opened upside risk in addition we have to also keep in mind that the vix is currently at rather depressed levels and even despite this qqqi is able to accommodate close to 15 in yield in my humble opinion it is worth considering adding qqqi into the portfolio to enhance the yield and or complement the incomeseeking etf share,,,,,,,,Very Old

A0440,2024-07-07,309,Abbott Laboratories (ABT): The Fantastic Mix Of Growth And Value - At A Great Price,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702736-abbott-laboratories-the-fantastic-mix-of-growth-and-value-at-a-great-price?source=feed_all_articles,hapabapa introduction bloomberg hit the nail on the head when it wrote highpriced sp 500 powers head untroubled by political stress essentially the market went back to doing what it does best which is betting on the fed easing rates going forward this allowed it to ignore poor employment numbers construction in the services industry and weakness in manufacturing sentiment the sp 500 gained 2 in the week the most since april as data showing a contraction in services industries and an uptick in the unemployment rate reinforced optimism on rate cuts tenyear treasury yields which initially spiked after biden’s disastrous june 27 performance spurred wagers that trump’s return to office would herald looser fiscal policy erased the increase as did the dollar falling for the first week since may bloomberg bloomberg dont get me wrong im not hating i know i may sound incredibly bearish when i write stuff like this i dont have any shorts in fact i dont even have cash after my latest investment this is all about the riskreward although we can make the case that stock market valuations are horrible tools for market timing the current situation hints that we may need to lower our expectations regardless of what happens in november or in general currently the sp 500 trades at 26x earnings which is higher than any election since at least 1990 bloomberg again this doesnt mean the market is toast especially not because these valuations are driven by fewer than ten megacap tech stocks what this means is that im looking for opportunities elsewhere which includes other areas with secular growth and companies that havent done so well recently one of them is abbott laboratories nyseabt the medical devices giant with a 180 billion market cap has been disappointing since its stock price peak in 4q21 back then the pandemic ended leaving covid19 winners in the dust while weakness is deserved after the valuation started to run redhot i have become a big believer in the potential this dividend king brings to the table my most recent article was written on april 22 when i went with the title why i believe abbott is much better positioned in todays rising inflation scenario since then shares are down 32 lagging the 116 return of the sp 500 by a substantial margin it has also allowed the sp 500 to beat abt over the past ten years including dividends it has beaten the healthcare giant by exactly 34 points data by ycharts as we slowly approach the companys earnings release on july 18 ill use this article to update my thesis and explain why i like the value abt brings to the table so lets get to it forget covid abbott is back i say this with the utmost respect for people who suffered from the pandemic but it was one of the most bullish periods for healthcare companies like abbott who sold hundreds of millions of tests and related products google news 2020 the problem is that it pushed so much money into the industry that it took many years to unwind all of the bullishness for example the ishares us medical devices etf ihi which returned 223 over the past ten years excluding dividends hasnt gone anywhere since january 2021 data by ycharts this has created an extremely tough situation for investors as its hard to deal with an industry that goes from skyhigh growth to contraction followed by an uncertain path of growth that really does a number on our ability to find appropriate pe multiples the good news is that 2024 seems to be the first year of elevated optimism for example in the first quarter the company raised its fullyear guidance expecting adjusted eps between 455 and 470 it expects organic sales growth excluding covid19 testing of 85 to 100 abbott laboratories this was driven by strong underlying growth including the achievement of excovid doubledigit organic sales growth for the fifth consecutive quarter with a 14 growth rate in medical devices and established pharmaceuticals what makes abt so powerful is diversification and its ability to innovate in each of its key segments this includes the news that it obtained product approvals and has seen major milestones in critical clinical trials in a number of key areas for example in diagnostics abbott received fda approval for a pointofcare diagnostic test that can determine if someone suffered a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in just 15 minutes run on its istat alinity product abbott laboratories as we can see below the diagnostics segment was the only segment with a negative impact from covid19 i highlighted organic growth and noncovid organic growth in the table below abbott laboratories moreover the company has seen 8 higher sales in its nutrition segment driven by doubledigit growth in pediatric nutrition and market share gains in the us infant formula business on top of that the launch of protality which is a new nutritional shake aimed at adults pursuing weight loss is expected to further support growth in this segment on a side note this makes abbott a winner of the current weightloss pill trend as its products go well with other weightloss treatments meanwhile in diabetes care freestyle libre sales reached 15 billion in the quarter this translates to a 23 growth rate abbott laboratories freestyle libre also benefited from the expansion of reimbursement coverage in major european markets like france and germany the company is also rapidly growing in heart health which is one of my favorite areas due to heart issues being the number one death cause using 2019 numbers old but still relevant a third of all deaths came from heartrelated issues our world in data in structural heart the company saw a 13 growth rate this was supported by products like navitor amulet and triclip moreover the recent fda approval of triclip which is designed for treating tricuspid regurgitation supports the companys ability to address major demand in another fastgrowing market abbott laboratories last but not least the company saw 17 growth in neuromodulation supported by the launch of eterna and liberta which are devices for pain management and movement disorders like parkinsons also two important growth markets wheres the shareholder value one major benefit of owning abt stock is its fantastic dividend for starters abbott laboratories is a dividend king which means it has hiked its dividends for more than 50 consecutive years please note that the dividend decline in 2013 was the abbvie abbv spinoff since then both abt and abbv have raised their dividends every single year data by ycharts that said a dividend king title is great but its not enough after all when a company is mature enough to gain dividend king status sometimes its so mature that dividend growth is slow hence while i respect dividend kings its not a criterion im aiming for in my research luckily abt is different its a dividend king that comes with a lot of dividend growth yielding 21 the company has a 48 payout ratio and a fiveyear cagr of 121 which is a great deal for at least two reasons a 21 yield with doubledigit dividend growth is a great combination we can expect elevated dividend growth to last as analysts are very upbeat about abts future after what we discussed in this article so far it may not be a surprise that analysts are upbeat using the factset data in the chart below analysts expect 4 eps growth this year including pandemic headwinds 2025 and 2026 are both expected to see 11 growth fast graphs as i have written in prior articles i believe this recovery deserves a higher multiple than its longterm 198x average looking at prior growth recoveries the company used to trade at 2425x earnings using that number would pave the road for 1214 annual returns in the years ahead that said i dont own abbott while i was looking to add it to my portfolio i bought too many new positions this year to justify adding another one at least for the next few months instead i decided to focus on my investment in danaher dhr which has a very high correlation to abt so dont be surprised im not long abt despite my bullish thesis takeaway i believe abbott laboratories presents a compelling opportunity due to its strong fundamentals and diversified growth across various segments with significant advancements in diagnostics nutrition diabetes care and heart health abbotts impressive dividend growth track record and innovative capabilities make it a solid longterm investment in its 2q24 earnings call i expect the company to shed more light on innovation and its ability to move beyond the challenging postpandemic environment while i currently dont hold abbott stock its potential for doubledigit returns in the coming years makes it a fantastic longterm play pros cons pros diversified growth abbott excels in multiple segments including diagnostics nutrition diabetes care and heart health which provides it with diversification and elevated growth abbott excels in multiple segments including diagnostics nutrition

A0441,2024-07-07,309,Kinross Gold: The Impressive Operational Performance Continues (NYSE:KGC),Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702728-kinross-gold-the-impressive-operational-performance-continues?source=feed_all_articles,bjoern wylezichistock via getty images overview kinross gold nysekgc is a large gold mining company that is guiding for a gold equivalent production of 21moz in 2024 which is roughly inline with what the company has produced over the last couple of years i have covered kinross a couple of times per year since 2022 and the prior articles on the company can be found here figure 1 source annual reports the company has much of its production coming from north and south america nowadays but a substantial amount of earnings and cash flows still comes from the lowcost tasiast mine in mauritania overall it is a relatively welldiversified gold mining company figure 2 source kinross presentation the stock price of kinross is this year up 41 outperforming the vaneck gold miners etf gdx by a decent margin and most peers the strong gold price has naturally been a tailwind for the company but the strong operational performance has also been a significant factor the company delivered a good q1 result figure 3 source koyfin operations figure 4 source kinross quarterly reports in the above chart we can see the gold equivalent production and costs on a consolidated level over the last couple of years for kinross the production volume has increased slightly compared to a couple of years ago and main contributing factor to the production increase is the ramp up of la coipa in chile the allin sustaining cost aisc has also been relatively flat lately which is better than many peers la coipa did in the most recent quarter have a gold equivalent production of 71koz together with a very competitive production cost of 733oz that is up from effectively no production in q1 2022 so it is fair to say la coipa has been a very welcomed addition to kinross portfolio of producing assets figure 5 source kinross quarterly reports figure 6 source kinross quarterly reports with that said paracatu in brazil and tasiast in maurtania are the two largest and most important producing assets for kinross the q1 2024 gold equivalent production for the two assets were 128koz for paracatu and 159koz for tasiast the production cost was 1059oz for paracatu in q1 and costs will be slightly elevated for paracatu during 2024 due to planned mine sequencing but the cost should come back down in 2025 the production cost was 660oz at tasiast which has both the highest production volume and lowest production cost among the assets so it accounts for a disproportionate percentage of the consolidated earnings and cash flows the three remaining producing assets in the us are slightly smaller and the production costs are also higher however they have like most assets of kinross performed reasonably well lately the production costs have decreased some at round mountain and bald mountain over the last couple of quarters figure 7 source kinross quarterly reports production was lower in the most recent quarter at fort know and the production cost has ticked up slightly over the last couple of quarters however the processing plant will see a substantial boost to the production volume when the ore from the manh choh project starts to get processed at fort know which is on track for first production in early q3 2024 this will be a welcomed nearterm catalyst for kinross there is also a resource update and a preliminary economic assessment “pea” due to be released on great bear during the second half of 2024 while we can likely expect great bear to continue to grow for some time due to the ongoing drilling the pea will provide some more accurate initial estimates on what great bear can be valued at peer comparison in the chart below we can see the forwardlooking price to earnings and ev to ebitda ratios over the last few years a couple of years ago the valuation multiples were much cheaper for kinross both on an absolute level but also compared to peers figure 8 source koyfin the valuation multiples for kinross are now more in the middle of the range some of the companies in the chart below have more jurisdictional risk which probably justifies a lower valuation alamos gold agi and agnico eagle aem have slightly higher valuation multiples which is also makes sense given the lower operating costs and less jurisdictional risk so that kinross today is somewhere in the middle of the ranges seems fair with that said kinross still has slightly more financial leverage than most of its peers even if the company has deleveraged some over the last couple of years so there is more balance sheet risk with kinross than most of the peers but the absolute level of financial leverage isnt at an alarming level figure 9 source koyfin conclusion kinross has some highquality assets which have performed very well lately so the management team has done great job the company also has an interesting nearterm catalyst with the manh choh project and the potential of great bear makes kinross a very interesting longterm investment as well figure 10 source kinross presentation with that said the stock price performance of kinross has been strong and the company feels relatively fairly valued at this point so i am neutral on the stock here i last bought kinross in mid2022 when the stock was really out of

A0451,2024-07-07,309,Scammed by the fake Chinese police,BBC Business,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p2lq0qk41o,scammed by the fake chinese police 8 hours ago by elaine chong and ed main bbc trending share bbc helen young was targeted by scammers who posed as chinese police officers chinese people around the world are being targeted by an elaborate scam in which criminals pretend to be chinese police a britishchinese woman has told the bbc that she handed over her life savings to con men who wore uniforms in video calls and gave her a virtual tour of what appeared to be a police station helen young still has nightmares about the fortnight that she was made to believe she was on china’s most wanted list scammers posing as chinese police manipulated the londonbased accountant into believing she was under investigation for a massive fraud back in her homeland helen was presented with a mountain of fabricated evidence which appeared to implicate her in a crime she knew nothing about when the fake police then threatened her with extradition to a jail cell in china helen sent them her £29000 life savings as “bail money” in a desperate attempt to stay in britain “i feel a bit stupid right now” she says “but theres no chance i can know thats not real its so convincing” helen’s story may sound extraordinary but there have been numerous similar cases in the chinese diaspora china’s embassies around the world have issued public warnings about police impersonation scams as has the fbi after a number of cases in the us one elderly woman in los angeles reportedly handed over 3m believing it would stop her extradition the fbi and chinese embassies around the world have issued warnings about police impersonation scams typically these scams begin with the target receiving a relatively innocuous phone call in helen’s case it was somebody claiming to be a chinese customs officer who told her they had stopped an illegal parcel sent in her name helen hadn’t sent anything and she was told she must file a police report if she believed someone had stolen her identity although she was sceptical helen didn’t hang up “chinese people like myself because we were born and bred in china we were taught obedience” she says “so when the party asked me to do something or my parents asked me it’s very rare that i will say no” helen was transferred to a man who said he was a policeman in shenzhen called “officer fang” helen asked for proof and he suggested they went on a video call when they connected helen saw a uniformed man whose face matched the police id he flashed officer fang then used his phone to give her a tour of what looked like a fully functioning police station with several uniformed officers and a desk with a large police logo “that moment all my suspicions are gone so i say im sorry i just have to be careful nowadays there are a lot of criminals out there” helen says while they were talking helen heard a message on the tannoy in the background telling officer fang to take a call about her officer fang put her on hold and when he returned he was no longer interested in the illegal parcel he said he had been informed that helen was suspected of involvement in a large financial fraud “i said that’s nonsense he said nobody says they’re guilty so it’s the evidence that counts” helen was shown what looked like a bank statement for a vast amount of money in her name officer fang told her that if she was innocent she must help them catch the real crooks he made her sign a confidentiality agreement promising not to tell anyone about the investigation helen was warned that if she did she would get an extra six months in prison “he said if you tell anyone you have been interviewed by the chinese police your life will be in danger” the scammers also made helen download an app so they could listen in to what she was doing day and night over the next few days helen tried to act normally at work she spent her evenings working on a personal statement that she was ordered to write detailing every aspect of her life then officer fang called back with the news that several suspects were now in custody he showed her written statements in which several people accused her helen was sent a video which appeared to show a male prisoner confessing to police and naming her as his boss in the fraud helens scammers used a personalised video confession to convince her she was facing criminal charges we have taken a closer look at the video and because the suspect is wearing a large covid mask it’s impossible to tell if what you’re hearing matches his lip movements it would be easy to add a fake soundtrack that mentions helens name or another victim but for helen who had been convinced she was dealing with genuine police officers the effect was devastating “after i heard my name like that i was vomiting it convinced me i was in deep deep trouble” helen believed officer fang when he then told her she would be extradited to china even though she’s a british citizen “he told me so you got 24 hours you pack your bags the police are coming to take you to the airport” helen was told she could halt her extradition if she could raise bail after sending over her bank statements for inspection she was told to transfer £29000 “i felt terrible because i promised my daughter to give her money for her first flat” helen says but a few days later the fake police were back helen was ordered to find another £250000 or be extradited “i was fighting for my life if i go back to china i may never come back” after helen tried to borrow the money from a friend he alerted her daughter helen broke down and revealed everything but not before she had put her phone in a kitchen drawer and taken her daughter into a bedroom and put a duvet over their heads so the scammers couldn’t listen in her daughter listened patiently and explained it was a scam helen’s bank eventually refunded her money but her ordeal could easily have had a bleaker ending “for two weeks i hardly slept how can you sleep when somebody is monitoring your phone in her sleepdeprived state she crashed her car twice on the second occasion she wrecked it entirely “i didn’t kill anyone but i could have these types of criminal scam could kill people” other victims of police impersonation scams have been pushed to even greater extremes in some extraordinary cases some chinese foreign students who can’t meet the financial demands of the fake police have been persuaded to fake their own kidnappings in order to seek a ransom from their families detective superintendent joe doueihi of new south wales police fronted a publicity campaign to warn about socalled virtual or cyberkidnappings after a series of cases in australia “victims are coerced into making their own video of them being in a vulnerable position to appear as if theyve been kidnapped tied up with tomato sauce on their body to make it look like theyve been bleeding and calling for help from their loved ones” he says new south wales police police in australia have issued warnings after a spate of virtual kidnappings the students are then ordered to isolate themselves while the scammers send these images to families back in china with a ransom demand the scam victims may also find themselves being manipulated into helping to scam others “scammers will trick a victim into believing that they are working for the chinese government they will send them documentation and swear them in as a chinese police officer” det supt doueihi says he says the victim who may have already handed over money to the criminals is sent to monitor or intimidate other chinese students in australia the bbc found ai filters which could help scammers mimic police for sale online many of these frauds are thought by experts to be run by chinese organised crime groups operating from compounds in countries like myanmar cambodia and laos chinese state media has reported that tens of thousands of suspects have been returned to china over the last year awareness of these types of scams is growing we spoke to a student in japan who realised he was being targeted by criminals and recorded their conversation he asked not to be named but shared the recording with the bbc in it the scammers tell him that if he revealed anything about the call to anyone then he would be jeopardising the investigation he refused to hand over any money and they stopped pursuing him he’s aware that he had a lucky escape i never thought it would happen to me just be really careful when you get a call from a number that you dont recognise”,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0452,2024-07-07,309,Of the UK economy’s two possible endings the happy one is more likely,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/07/uk-economy-two-possible-endings,just as in the movie sliding doors there are two endings to the story that began on thursday with labour’s victory in the 2024 election one is happy one is sad and either is possible what happens to the economy over the next five years will determine which one materialises let’s start with the happy ending the one where the credits roll as keir starmer wins big for a second time in 2029 the script for that one starts slowly the scale of labour’s win means it doesn’t have to rush things but has time to put in place the supplyside reforms such as changes to planning rules that will boost growth structural changes don’t bear fruit overnight but by the early 2030s it should be possible to notice the difference in the meantime the economy will benefit from a muchneeded period of stability business investment was depressed during the period when there was uncertainty over whether the uk would leave the eu or not it suffered another hit during the pandemic and a third after russia’s invasion of ukraine a chaotic period in which the uk had three prime ministers and five chancellors in a single parliament is now over the poor showing of the snp in the election means the prospects of a second referendum on scottish independence in the next five years are much diminished likewise starmer is unlikely to reconsider his decision to rule out rejoining the eu or even the single market with reform uk breathing down labour’s neck in so many seats as things stand britain looks a safer place for investment than france or germany much has been said about labour’s baleful economic inheritance but growth is set to surprise on the upside in the coming months consumer spending power has been boosted in recent months because wages have been rising more rapidly than prices but there tends to be a lag before households realise they are better off the election result will be the catalyst for higher consumer spending and it will also prompt businesses to give the goahead for investment decisions put on hold in recent months the boost to growth will provide rachel reeves with a bit more scope in her autumn budget she may also be tempted to make changes to the government’s debt rules which would provide her with some additional wriggle room it won’t be a massive windfall and the new chancellor says money will be tight but she might have an extra £20bn to spend on public services starmer and reeves won’t need to rush because the tories will spend the postelection period at war with each other over the future direction of the party rather than in opposing what labour is doing one big problem for rishi sunak in his period as prime minister was that the economic and political cycles became misaligned with tough decisions such as the freeze on tax allowances and thresholds biting in the last years of the parliament the prospects of a second labour victory will be much enhanced if reeves gets the unpopular stuff out of the way early and then lets up as the next election approaches the alternative ending is not nearly so cheerful the gentle recovery in the economy runs out of steam as stubbornly high inflation in the service sector deters the bank of england from cutting interest rates business investment continues to disappoint while dearer fixedrate mortgages and stagnant house prices make consumers cautious about spending money the situation cries out for the new government to boost public spending or cut taxes but reeves is boxed in by her own selfimposed fiscal rules public demands for better public services go unanswered and disillusionment quickly sets in starmer and reeves insist that their structural reforms will eventually pay dividends but as was the case when sunak tried the same line of argument nobody is listening labour’s landslide victory was the result of a collapse in support for the conservatives rather than a ringing endorsement of starmer’s offering never before has a party won so big a majority with such a modest share of the vote 34 jeremy corbyn won a bigger percentage of the vote when labour was defeated in 2017 starmer and reeves are on probation as far as britain’s sceptical and impatient voters are concerned and they are deluding themselves if they think this is 1997 redux the economy is weaker and public services are in a worse state sitting tight for two years is not an option it may take time for the conservatives to recover from the pasting they have just taken but there are alternative sources of opposition the green party threatens to pick up unhappy labour voters from the left while reform uk could do the same from the right the liberal democrats will be attractive for those who want a closer relationship with the eu the tories won big in 2019 but last week lost more than 250 seats something similar could easily happen to labour in 2029 so which ending is it going to be on balance the happy ending looks slightly more likely that’s not because the country is set for an economic boom the uk has deepseated problems that are not going to be solved overnight but such was the desire of voters to be shot of the conservatives that it will take time before they are trusted again the tories need labour to screw up the economy to have a chance of a quick comeback but it is reasonable to assume that the next five years will be better than the previous five that might not be saying much but it should be enough,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0453,2024-07-07,309,Precision Drilling Stock: Automation Makes It A Buy (TSX:PD:CA),Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702754-precision-drilling-automation-makes-it-a-buy?source=feed_all_articles,phonlamaiphotoistock via getty images investment thesis precision drilling corporation nysepds is experiencing a significant increase in the number of service rigs and more could come thanks to the trans mountain pipeline expansion and regulatory spending requirements for well abandonment increase the recent plans for reduction of the debt levels and distribution of 2535 of fcf generated to shareholders could accelerate demand for the stock price target based on my own discounted cash flow analysis the fair value is 104105 per share business review drilling is the most relevant activity precision drilling is an energy company based in the united states and canada that has also developed international activity in some areas of its business during 2023 close to 87 of its revenue came from drilling activity under specific contracts the remaining net sales came from the other segment which offers completion workover and ancillary services to oil gas exploration and production companies international activity consists of drilling services which include technology for the development of platforms and consulting to comply with environmental regulations in each case cwc energy services accretive on a 2024 cash flow pershare basis during the year 2023 precision drilling accomplished the acquisition of cwc energy services which meant an expansion in its activities in canada adding 62 drilling service platforms in this country in addition to equipment inventory and operating facilities that were added to the 111 platforms that were already active the acquisition was valued at 127 million on november 7 2023 in my opinion the most relevant is that the company expects the transaction to be accretive on a 2024 cash flow pershare basis hence we could see an increase in cash flow per share in 2024 as compared to that in 2023 with the projected synergies we expect the transaction to be accretive on a 2024 cash flow per share basis and to support our ongoing deleveraging plan source press release precision has achieved headcount and operational annual runrate synergies of approximately 13 million source annual report automation and data processing software to enhance drilling activities one of the differentials that precision has found within the competitive markets of the energy sector is the development of its alpha digital platform which uses automation and data processing software oriented towards each of its clients in addition the company maintains evergreen technology developed to optimize environmental pollution rates through the automation of the operation of drilling equipment and data processing during 2023 the company had the most modern drilling equipment in canada which not only has alpha and evergreen technology but also maintains some robotic functions adding to the automation capabilities as well as increasing general safety levels in the development of activities in my view these technologies could enhance future drilling activities and offer an enhancement in the environmental pollution rates in addition clients may demand more drilling services as robotic functions offered increase according to market research survey the use of robotic drilling equipment in the petroleum industry is projected to rise at 85 cagr through 2033 i incorporated these assumptions in my forecasts new international rigs and the trans mountain pipeline expansion represent a net sales driver in the last management report i could read about eight rigs running throughout 2024 which is expected to represent a 40 increase in activity compared to 2023 we are talking about a 50 increase in the companys international eps which i think may benefit future earnings expectations and the demand for the stock i could also observe a significant optimistic outlook for the business coming from rig activations and new bids besides if clients continue to show up thanks to the trans mountain pipeline expansion and regulatory spending requirements for well abandonment increase revenue growth could also accelerate we continue to bid our remaining idle rigs within the region and remain optimistic about our ability to secure additional rig activations as the premier well service provider in canada with size and scale the outlook for this business is positive source management discussion and analysis growing number of service rigs compliance with covenants signed and debt reduction plans there is a significant momentum growth in the number of well servicing rigs in the quarter ended march 31 2024 the number of service rigs was 183 in the same quarter in 2023 the number of rigs was 118 the change in the number of service rigs was 55 in my view further increase in momentum growth could bring new revenue growth source management discussion and analysis besides the company is in compliance with covenants signed as of march 31 2024 precision drilling reported consolidated covenant ebitda to consolidated interest expense of 74x the covenant signed was 25x source management discussion and analysis according to the last annual report one of the central objectives of the companys present strategy is to reduce the total amount of debt in the long term the reduction objectives are 500 million by 2025 the company plans to reduce debt by 150 million to 200 million in 2024 during the year we reduced our debt by 152 million and allocated 15 of our free cash flow to share repurchases our focus on our debt reduction strategy remains firmly in place and in 2024 we plan to reduce debt by another 150 million to 200 million source annual report besides in the last quarterly report precision promised once again to return 2535 of fcf generated to shareholders in my view further reduction in the debt levels could lead to increases in the evfwd ebitda ratio precision remains on track to reduce debt between 150 million and 200 million in 2024 and return between 25 and 35 of free cash flow to shareholders in 2024 source management discussion and analysis the cfo brings investment banking expertise i reviewed the board of directors and the business profile of different members of management i think that wall street analysts may like the profile of carey t ford cfo of precision he brings expertise accumulated in investment banking in my view if the company needs to assess potential mergers or acquisitions with other competitors or even the sale of precision drilling he will offer beneficial judgment to bring a beneficial opinion to the board of directors besides he may know well what the company needs to offer to market participants and shareholders to enhance the valuation of the company carey t ford currently serves as senior vice president chief financial officer for precision he joined the company in may 2011 mr ford previously held the positions of vice president finance investor relations and senior vice president finance operations before being named interim chief financial officer in march of 2016 prior to joining precision mr ford spent seven years as an investment banker at simmons company international serving clients in the oilfield service sector source precisiondrilling the balance sheet shows a significant decrease in total debt precisions balance sheet shows an assetliability ratio of more than 22x this ratio increased from close to 19x in 2019 precision drilling reports an increase in the total amount of property and equipmenttotal liabilities from 2019 to 2024 which i think is quite beneficial the company appears to be reducing its total amount of liabilities at a faster rate than the property and equipment source authors compilations based on data from the 10q in the last report the company reported 22 billion in total assets and 1 billion in total liabilities so the book value per share is lower than the current stock price according to seeking alpha the sector median pricebook value is close to 15x given these figures precision drilling appears quite undervalued source authors compilations based on data from seeking alpha as shown in the image below the total amount of longterm debt decreased by around 13 in 2023 8 in 2022 and 9 in 2021 in my view a further decrease in the total amount of debt will most likely lead to an increase in the companys evfwd ebitda source authors compilations based on data from seeking alpha discounted cash flow analysis in connection with rendering the opinion given and performing my related financial analyses i reviewed the companys annual report and the most recent report from management besides for the assessment of future adjusted ebitda growth the calculation of ebitda changes in net working capital taxes and capex i reviewed sas tool source seeking alpha i also assumed a growing number of service rigs fcf growth thanks to the trans mountain pipeline expansion and regulatory spending requirements for well abandonment increase besides i also expect growth as a result of the use of automation and data processing software with the previous assumptions i included net sales growth of 4 from 2026 to 2028 with growing da growing capex and growing unlevered free cash flow under my own assumptions unlevered fcftotal revenue would be close to 13 and 11 from 2025 to 2028 these numbers were based on my own judgment previous assumptions and previous cash flow statements source authors work for the selection of the terminal evttm ebitda i had a look at the multiples currently reported by peers competitors trade at close to 4x ttm ebitda and 10x ebitda i used an exit multiple of 45x besides after reviewing previous quarterly reports and 10ks i incorporated a cost of capital of 9 source seeking alpha finally i performed a dcf to calculate the implied equity value by summing the discounted unlevered free cash flow from 2024 to 2028 and the discounted terminal value and subtracting the net debt i obtained a target equity value of 1532 million dividing by the total number of shares outstanding my target value is close to 104105 per share precisions ev fwd sales and ev fwd ebitda show significant undervaluation a quick look at the evfwd sales and evfwd ebitda ratio reported by precision drilling and that from the industry indicates significant undervaluation the companys evebitda appears to offer a 27 discount as compared to peers source seeking alpha other companies focused on drilling such as helmerich payne hp as well as nabors nbr show an ev fwd ebitda between 4x45x which is not far from that of precision drilling hence i think that by means of a merger of precision drilling with another company offering more services from drilling the total evfwd ebitda of the new entity may increase equity research share price targets i reviewed publicly available consensus estimate stock price targets for the company i could find wall street analysts covering the stock who published research with an average price target of 100 these numbers are in line with my expectations and price target of 104105 it appears clear that most people in the market think that precision drilling is undervalued we saw mergers in the sector in 2023 pattersonuti energy inc pten and nextier oilfield solutions inc signed a merger in 2023 which included 200 million of annual cost savings and operational synergies within 18 months following close precision drilling could also team with another large player in the united states or canada to generate synergies i could not blame shareholders for expecting such a similar transaction with other players like helmerich payne nabors liberty energy profrac holding rpc calfrac well step energy or trican well potential cost synergies observed in the merger between pten and nextier could appear risks from changes in the oil price precisions revenue will most likely fluctuate in relation to the oil price lower oil price and gas price may lead to lower drilling activity in the united states and canada if clients decide to reduce their activities precision drilling would see decreases in the unlevered fcf under this case scenario analysts could lower their expectations about the future and the demand for the stock could lower generally we experience high demand for our services when commodity prices are relatively high and the opposite is true when commodity prices are relatively low the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices accounts for much of the cyclical nature of the oilfield services business in recent years increased volatility and other factors beyond our control have led to greater uncertainty in the demand for our services source annual report risks from trans mountain pipeline and regulatory uncertainty in western canada precision drilling could suffer from delays in the construction of the trans mountain pipeline in western canada besides management noted that other proposed lng facilities in canada could also suffer from delays if the company fails to complete their expected timelines expected net sales growth may decrease in the worst case scenario future unlevered fcf may also decline and the implied fair price would be lower than expected construction is progressing on the trans mountain pipeline in western canada and may be in service in the first half of 2024 canada generally has also lagged behind other natural gas producing countries in taking advantage of rising global demand and prices for natural gas primarily as a result of canadas lack of liquified natural gas facilities and by extension export capacity owing to regulatory delay and uncertainty source annual report other proposed lng facilities in canada are at earlier stages of development including woodfibre lng and ksi lisims lng completions currently anticipated between 2027 and 2028 there is no assurance that lng projects in canada will be completed on their expected timelines or at all source annual report risks from violence in the middle east region as noted precision drilling maintains activities internationally specifically in the middle east region where the capitalizable market is large and oil activity is highly concentrated based on the signing of new contracts and the insurance of its activity within the middle east for the short and medium term the company increased its lines of credit for insurance on this activity from 30 million to 40 million in any case with regard to this region specifically the outlook is uncertain due to the growing violence between the israeli state and neighboring countries at some point i think that the activities of precision drilling could be affected by the war in the region conclusion precision drilling is currently experiencing a growing number of service rigs and offered a beneficial outlook thanks to the trans mountain pipeline expansion and regulatory spending requirements for well abandonment increase i would expect net sales growth as a result of new robotic functions and the use of automation and data processing software in addition management recently promised to lower its debt levels as well as to return 2535 of fcf generated to shareholders i think that these initiatives could represent successful future price catalysts for the stock based on my own dcf model peer review and research of other opinions from analysts my price target is 104105 per share,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0454,2024-07-07,309,Armour Residential: The 15% Yield Indicates Trouble May Be Brewing (NYSE:ARR),Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702750-armour-residential-15-percent-yield-indicates-trouble-may-be-brewing?source=feed_all_articles,art wagere via getty images introduction armour residentials nysearr shares have been headed in one direction and one direction only and thats down over the three years shares of armour have tumbled 66 losing two thirds of their value while the company has been paying a fat dividend to shareholders i view the current distribution as being unsustainable even in spite of several cuts with the current yield at 15 the market seems to be hinting at signs of trouble in this article ill explain the risks i see with armour residential and why i would avoid the companys shares today data by ycharts company overview armour residential is a real estate investment trust reit that is primarily involved in the mortgagebacked securities market specifically in residential mortgages mortgagebacked securities are financial instruments that are comprised of pools of mortgages where the securities represent an ownership interest in them essentially armour residential invests in mortgages rather than physical properties and it earns income from the interest payments on the underlying mortgage loans in its portfolio as a reit armour residential is required to distribute at least 90 of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends to pay its distributions and earn income on the mortgagebacked securities armour residential arbitrages the difference between what it can borrow at versus what it can earn in returns the mortgages it invests in are generally those issued by a government sponsored entity like fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae otherwise known as agency securities these usually consist of fixed rate loans but some portion is also backed by hybrid adjustable rate or adjustable rate loans in addition to mitigate interest rate risk the company uses hedges sometimes to manage risk within the portfolio background when looking at the share price action of armour residential over the last three years investors have lost nearly half of their investment 43 even when including huge dividends paid to shareholders comparing the return over the last three years to the sp500s positive total return of 33 illustrates a widening divergence in performance over time particularly one that i would characterize as destructive of shareholder value data by ycharts so whats been going on in my view armour residential pays out an unstable amount of dividends to shareholders that isnt backed up by current free cash flow and earnings the mortgage reit model in general is one thats highly levered so any movement in spread between the cost of borrowing and return on investment of securities could have serious implications to the business we see this impact through the companys dividend history over time as observed below theres been a series of at least four cuts in the last five years to the dividend highlighting that the current dividend warrants scrutiny and could be at risk seeking alpha whenever you see dividend cuts like this its often helpful to ask whether the current dividends are supported by current cash flows and earnings over the last five years with the exception of 2021 when interest rates were near zero armour has been generating losses in earnings per share since the situation has become somewhat troubling on the earnings call management noted that it is suspending management fees until further notice previously the company suspended management fees during the pandemic due to the uncertainty surrounding the business and since then they havent reinstituted that back data by ycharts outlook can armour right the ship in my view if the latest results are any indication management hasnt been making the right bets to generate earnings for shareholders at the end of the quarter book value per share was 2207 per common share in the 23 days after quarter end the book value fell 72 to 2048 per common share when looking at the yield spreads during the quarter net yield on interest earning assets was 53 million vs net interest income of 122 million while the quarter had positive net income of 145 million this was in large part due to a favorable move in interest rates and spreads going back to fy22 and fy23 net income was a loss of 230 million and 67 million which i think are more reflective of what returns would look like in this business during this interest rate environment at present the company pays 30 million in dividends to preferred stockholders and 353 million in dividends to common shareholders each quarter which is much higher than current earnings run rate even for this most recent quarter of positive net income company filings how should one approach armour as an investment with respect to the macroeconomic outlook the way i would think about armour is essentially a bet on interest rates if youre constructive on spreads longer term and that the fed will begin to aggressively start cutting rates then an investment in armour could make sense based on whats being priced into the curve jerome powells latest comments noted that if the federal reserve cuts too much and too quickly inflation could reaccelerate which would force policymakers to reverse course and impose punishing rate hikes on the other hand if they wait too long to reduce borrowing costs the fed risks a weakening of the economy which could trigger a recession if the market isnt ready at present inflation is at 327 slightly above the feds longterm target of 2 in my view i dont foresee the fed cutting too much why the dollar remains strong ability to print more money if needed given political issues in europe rhetoric from the fed has been hawkish and overall gdp growth looks poised to climb at least 2 this year overall i think most investors have underestimated the resiliency of the us economy and it may in fact turn out that we get few rate cuts than previously expected earlier this year the market was pricing in 5 rate cuts and its looking less likely thats about to happen given this im inclined to avoid shares of armour with implied leverage of 74 and debtequity of 68 i find armour to be carrying risk above my comfort level conclusion ultimately an investment in armour is a levered bet on interest rates however even if you think interest rates are going to come down faster than expected id still avoid shares over the last ten years shares have lost about 88 of their value and so even as interest rates have dropped over time theres still been somewhat of an impairment in value while the company pays generous dividends at a 15 yield investors should be cautious investing in what i see as a value trap and a yield thats not adequately supported through the companys earnings and cash flows in my view with an unsustainable yield and a leveraged balance sheet i would avoid shares today and rate shares as a sell,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0455,2024-07-07,309,PotlatchDeltic: Inflation Hedge Being Given Away For Cheap (Rating Upgrade) (NASDAQ:PCH),Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702748-potlatchdeltic-inflation-hedge-being-given-away-for-cheap?source=feed_all_articles,andrei metelev some would say that we are stalking potlatchdeltic corporation nasdaqpch and they would be in the ballpark of being right just look at the most recent three reviews of the company from our side 1 when we reviewed pch in september of last year we highlighted the rapidly declining operating income the company was not even generating sufficient cashflow to cover its distribution there were a few positives that offset some of the negatives noted above and we noted them in that piece on the whole we were neutral on the stock and suggested 45 strike covered calls expiring in may 2024 for those bullish cost basis net of premium 4092 data by ycharts 2 we wrote on this ticker again and if you guessed it was in december 2023 you would not be wrong if you guessed that we became bearish on the stock we would be uncomfortable with how well you know us seeking alpha the three reasons that made us mildly optimistic on the stock back in september no longer held true and we told you run for the hills and away from the timberlands 3 the most recent piece we wrote on this ticker was in april of this year the stock had declined further and was trading at 4119 then and we felt this was time once again to upgrade the stock to a hold it would be an understatement to say all of these tactical trading calls have paid of far better than a buy and hope methodology the price is getting closer to where we said we would start getting interested in the covered calls for this stock data by ycharts but do the current fundamentals justify the stock price lets review the recent numbers and find out q12024 pch had a tough 2023 relative to 2022 but things were way rougher in early 2024 adjusted ebitda was just at 294 million and the previously strong wood segments delivered negative numbers pch q12024 presentation you can see the variance work up from q42023 in the slide below that looks a bit better and the key detractor there was lower developmental real estate sales pch q12024 presentation timberlands has held steady here and it is the only one providing pch with some cash flow today pch q12024 presentation wood products while negative was a big improvement from q42023 pch q12024 presentation we can see the overall trend in the next picture as lumber prices have lost all lumbar support pch has seen its adjusted ebitda dwindle pch q12024 presentation even the comparatives from 2023 dont really pain the full picture you can see 200 million generated in adjusted ebitda for all of 2023 compare that to the adjusted ebitda for just one quarter in 2021 generated record total adjusted ebitdda of 2750 million and total adjusted ebitdda margin of 61 source pch not only has the ebitda dropped precipitously even the modest leverage the company carries has now become enormous ebitda leverage which generally runs at around 2x for pch is now near 50x pch q12024 presentation cash available for distribution or cad has been running negative for two straight quarters pch q12024 presentation so you would have to be blind to not see just how challenging the current setup is we are doing what the thing with cyclical sectors is that things look horrible at bottoms there is no end in sight to negativity here we have some of the worst lumber prices in a long time these prices are even lower when you adjust for inflation after all you need labor to cut down trees and then you need the mills which cost a lot more than they did 2 decades back to get your lumber from your timber so yes prices are bad we have the very obvious possibility of a recession and housing demand cannot possibly move up into that so the chart below which looks pretty bad will get worse itso we also have apartment construction peaking we know because we have been dangling the chart in front of anyone who will look at it the reits themselves are telegraphing that inflation pressures are still strong and a rapid cut cycle is not in the immediate future so the confluence of negativity is epic that is also precisely what cyclical sectors look like at bottoms pch trades here at a solid 40 discount to consensus nav as well there is nothing stopping that nav from moving lower there is nothing stopping the discount from widening but this is a price where if you have a long term outlook you have to be fairly excited you were not that chaser who went after it because pch was producing heaps of cash flow in 2021 you are the methodical investor who realizes that this is an inflation hedge coming to you for cheap think about the possibilities when supplydemand equation turns as it always does for commodities pch could easily double from here and dole out massive dividends along the way our favorite indicator is also flashing green this is the commitment of traders cot number which shows the smartmoney also known as the commercials heavily long those unfamiliar might want to read our sell rating article where we were bearish on pch because of this we have not seen such a bullish setup on lumber before barchart verdict while the debt to ebitda may look scary we evaluate this more in terms of debt to nav on that metric the total debt is about 1520 of nav they also have a ton of liquidity but if they dont like the cost of debt they can always dispose of the debt worst case scenario here is that pch may have to liquidate a little timberland for 2024 and 2025 maturities pch q12024 presentation all in all pch offers a trading opportunity as well as a longer term accumulation opportunity those buying for the long term may want to average in here slowly and possibly use covered calls to buffer their entries one example is shown below authors app this one also offers potential for some capital appreciation we rate this a buy please note that this is not financial advice it may seem like it sound like it but surprisingly it is not investors are expected to do their own due diligence and consult with a professional who knows their objectives and constraints,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0456,2024-07-07,309,Tesco: Euros And Olympics Should Accelerate Revenues (OTCMKTS:TSCDF),Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702747-tesco-euros-and-olympics-should-accelerate-revenues?source=feed_all_articles,mammuthistock unreleased via getty images tesco plc otcpktscdf continues to maintain the guidance of a flat profit development into next year meaning that their strategy of funneling sales into finest which has a positive mix effect as discussed in our previous coverage is working it also means that they expect revenue acceleration in the coming quarters thanks to the euros and the olympics these positives are needed because there has been a major minimum wage effect of 9 the businesses under pressure in booker are not major profit contributors in all we think that the guidance is reasonable and achievable however tesco trades in line with peers and we dont see them having any special edge at this point in a relative sense in an absolute sense we think that better and more obscure businesses can be bought at lower multiples on broader markets and tesco will always have to battle with fierce competition and pressure from wages q1 trading update as usual tesco does not provide profit data in its q1 and q3 trading updates with more significant disclosures only happening at the h1 and fy marks nonetheless the trading update is a useful moment for analysts to ask questions and for qualitative disclosure to be made the first thing we note are the current sales changes they are solid at around 34 growth in revenues and the inflation impact is now quite minimal at not more than 2 volumes are strong in several of the segments and the focus on keeping cost increases minimal has meant significant market share gains by tesco in a continuing trend their policy is an aldi price match our progress is clearly demonstrated by our growth in market share with the latest kantar read showing the highest gains for the last two years this has been supported by 15 consecutive periods of switching gains ken murphy ceo of tesco sales highlights q1 tu the uk is seeing strong growth in volumes and one of the elements at play is that they are commanding the midmarket within their shops with supermarket label finest which is an uptrade from their other tesco labeled products but still more competitive in pricing than the branded products on their shelves in our last coverage we noted that branded sellers were getting more aggressive with promotional pricing in order to compete with tesco products which is good for the national inflation situation and of course for tesco customers reflecting the highly competitive nature of the business finest is being expanded with pub classics now on offer in order to capitalise on what should be a solid couple of quarters for sports events the euros is the current consideration with england continuing to get deeper in the tournament and tesco hopes it will get some biannual benefit from customers treating themselves when eating in to watch the games the olympics comes after and should offer some similar benefit the weak segment has been bookers best food logistics was acquired at a nominal price and provides distribution services to customers like burger king and pret in the uk they are downsizing their reach to try to improve profits since the profitability is marginal in the business look i mean on your first question on best food logistics and profitability look its not a material piece of the profit so its less than a handful of million imran nawaz cfo of tesco tobacco is in secular decline taking a comp of logista otcpkcdnif which also does tobacco distribution we see that tobacco distribution might be more of a profit detractor the tobacco distribution business should have similar operating margins to the tesco average based on this comp but it is only around 3 of revenues still and even annualising the 5 decline we are only talking about 45 million gbp lost booker breakdown q1 tu they also made a new acquisition within booker of a spirits and drinks business that they can integrate and provide wholesale valuation and risks the wage increase of employees is going to cost tesco around 300 million gbp sainsbury otcqxjsnsf will also be investing around 200 million gbp labour costs are sampled at around 912 of sales for grocers the figures provided by sainsbury and tesco imply a lower rate at their stores around 6 for sainsbury and around 5 for tesco knowing that both are doing around 10 wage increases at their stores however by another calculation 220000 employees affected are getting a 2000 gbp annual pay increase which amounts to an increase in costs of around 440 million gbp for tesco or a little less than 10 of gross profit regardless to hit profit targets we think a comprehensive 5 sales growth will need to be achieved based on last years annual figures before wage hikes this estimation is based on the assumption that some commodities have deflated and it should be possible to grow revenues while keeping incremental cogs growth outside of the wage increases flat a more conservative guess would be to assume that tesco manages to control gross margins at current levels of around 7 as of the fy which would require an 8 sales increase to offset around 400 million gbp in increased wage costs a midpoint of the given figure and our back of the envelope calculation is snapshot fy 2023 pr with mix effects not all of that 5 needs to be volumes importantly the euros and the olympics should be able to accelerate revenues beyond the current 39 mark to be able to hit 5 for the year more mix and less volume effects are more likely to accrete the gross margin since volume is more operationally intensive we think these numbers are doable although the 8 sales growth would maybe be a stretch but more importantly we arent that happy with tescos valuation its pe is almost exactly in line with another supermarket and grocer stock in the uk sainsbury there is no relative valuation case at around 125x pe and there isnt a super absolute case either the reciprocal of the pe is the earnings yield and it is less than 8 businesses like tesco arent without risks there are significant competitive challenges at all times reflected in the fact that a major operational policy is to make sure that all prices are matched to aldi which is low cost and there is meaningful pressure from labour prices as well reflected in the substantial wage increases theyve had to undertake and the intensity of coverage of the cost of living crisis in the uk we feel that there are plenty of businesses at that pe or lower that are under less pressure and face fewer potential issues in more obscure markets avoiding the supermarket and grocery business altogether which has a challenging industry structure editors note this article

Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702744-my-top-15-high-growth-dividend-stocks-july-2024?source=feed_all_articles,pavel muravevistock via getty images quality stocks the spdr sp 500 trust etf spy added 353 in june posting its 7th positive month out of the last 8 calendar months vanguards dividend appreciation index fund etf shares vig posted a more modest gain of 141 and my watchlist performed the weakest of the three positing a gain of 069 the watchlist continues to struggle in 2024 thus far trailing spy and vig every single month this year yeartodate my watchlist is down 485 meanwhile vig is up 766 and spy is up 1523 while this underperformance is very large strong past performance has kept the watchlist relatively close to vig since inception this isnt the first time the watchlist found itself in a rough patch and it likely wont be the last however relying on longterm data i have conviction the strategy will bounce back and recoup lost ground in the months to come this is the first 6 month streak of underperformance for the watchlist relative to spy and vig since inception previously the longest losing streak was 4 months on two separate occasions even though spy and vig are off to a better start my watchlist remains within a reasonable range to vig and sees its gap to spy continue to widen since inception september of 2020 the watchlist has a cagr of 1107 compared to 1118 for vig and 1402 for spy my goal is not to beat spy or vig but to generate a longterm rate of return of at least 12 even though the watchlist posted a positive gain in june its long term cagr declined the main goal of this watchlist is to find the best combination of highquality companies trading for attractive prices i believe this is the optimal longterm strategy for building wealth the top 15 dividend growth stocks for july 2024 offer an average dividend yield of 156 collectively they have increased dividend payments at a rate of 2225 during the last 5 years based on dividend yield theory these 15 stocks are about 31 undervalued right now and i think they are poised to offer strong longterm returns i would suggest considering two approaches to dividend investing the first involves dollarcost averaging into a diversified portfolio comprising at least 1020 highquality dividendpaying stocks spanning various sectors and industries by adopting a dollarcost averaging strategy you mitigate the risk associated with attempting to time the market over an extended period this method allows you to acquire shares at market highs lows and inbetween ultimately establishing an average cost basis situated in the middle the second method introduces a slightly higher level of risk it entails investing in undervalued stocks while still adhering to a dollarcost averaging strategy in this approach you diversify across a minimum of 1020 distinct highquality companies spanning multiple sectors and industries the increased risk stems from the possibility that your valuation methodology may prove inaccurate however by spreading investments across multiple stocks the likelihood of correctly identifying undervalued opportunities may improve the potential upside resulting from accurate selections may well outweigh any underperformance stemming from less successful picks watchlist criteria the criteria used to determine which stocks are included in my highgrowth dividend stock watchlist remain unchanged for july 2024 it is made up of the 8 factors listed below that have historically outperformed the broad universe of dividendpaying stocks when analyzed collectively market cap of at least 10 billion payout ratio no greater than 70 5year dividend growth rate of at least 5 5year revenue growth rate of at least 2 5year eps growth rate of at least 2 sp earnings and dividend rating of b or better wide or narrow moat morningstar exemplary or standard management team morningstar the rules identified 114 stocks for the month that were all ranked based on the abovementioned metrics with the exclusion of market cap i then computed the current valuation for each stock using dividend yield theory all stocks were ranked for both quality and valuation and sorted by the best combination of both next i computed a forecasted rate of return for the next 5year period for each of the stocks this return is based on forecasted earnings growth a return to fair value and the dividend yield the highestranked 15 stocks with a forecasted return greater than or equal to 12 were chosen for the watchlist the longterm hypothesis for this watchlist is that it will outperform a broadquality dividend fund such as vanguards dividend appreciation etf vig and that it will generate a 12 annualized rate of total return watchlist for july 2024 created by author above are the 15 stocks i am considering for further evaluation during the month they are sorted in descending order by their rank and 5year dividend growth rate the ou column represents potential undervalue this is a comparison of the current dividend yield to the historical dividend yield as a function of share price the expected return in the table above was computed using a discounted 5year eps forecast a return to fair value and the current dividend yield there is also a margin of safety built into the forecasted return these figures are just assumptions based on the available data and there is no guarantee these returns will be attained there are 3 changes to the top 15 list from the prior month elevance health elv fedex fdx and tjx companies tjx have fallen further down the list or do not meet the 12 expected rate of return threshold and were replaced by albemarle alb coca cola europacific ccep and canadian national railway cni past performance the top 15 list from june posted a modest gain of 069 underperforming both benchmarks and as a result the longterm alpha has shrunk further the longterm annualized rate of return for the watchlist decreased from 1112 last month to 1107 my target rate of return is 12 and the modest setback in june has moved the watchlist further from its target month top 15 all vig spy 1 month 069 078 141 353 3 month 347

stocks along the way five of the stocks presented during the last 46 months have gone on to lose more than 50 a watchlist much like an index includes both good and bad companies its very difficult to create an automated stock selection strategy that only produces great ideas however rather than focusing on the few bad apples that have appeared on this list lets shed a little light on its success eleven stocks identified by this process have gone on to produce returns in excess of 100 and another eight have generated returns in excess of 50 i have used this list to find many great stocks that i have added to my personal portfolio but i encourage you to use it primarily as a starting point for further research the watchlist aims to find the best combination of highquality companies trading

A0458,2024-07-07,309,PepsiCo: Consistent Earnings Growth Despite Challenging Conditions (NASDAQ:PEP),Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702734-pepsico-consistent-earnings-growth-despite-challenging-conditions?source=feed_all_articles,fotoatelie overview as a dividend growth investor i love the ability to collect income from companies that have very visible product portfolios the cusp of summer is here and that means lots of barbeques family gatherings and events that will have pepsico nasdaqpep products i previously covered pep and discussed how the price drop made it more attractive than cocacola ko this time around i wanted to provide an updated valuation and talk about how the lackluster recent performance can be attributed more to cyclical vulnerabilities rather than fundamental issues within i will be providing my personal thoughts on the upcoming earnings as well data by ycharts we can see that pep has lagged the sp 500 spy over the last fiveyear period however this isnt unique since we can also see that the consumer staples sector xlp has also be underperforming this underperformance can likely be linked to factors such as elevated interest rates and continued high inflation levels month after month this sort of environment encourages tightening consumer spend and as a result pep has experienced slower sales growth than normal despite the slower growth rates pep has managed to offset this by strengthening their balance sheet with increased cash positions in addition pep remains attractively priced from a valuation perspective i believe that the price of pep remains heavily suppressed by the current high interest rate environment despite the slower growth rates pep has still ultimately managed to grow when other consumerbased peers are struggling to maintain the same momentum lets first take a look at the current financial picture and why i believe that pep still remains a buy despite the underperformance pepsi earnings preview peps portfolio of products has allowed the company to have several different avenues that generate revenue the north america beverage channel brings in about 30 of the net revenue while the fritolay portfolio brings in about 27 of the net revenue data compiled by deloitte shows us that consumer spending has continued to decrease while consumers prioritize saving in an effort to offset higher inflation levels and higher interest rates deloitte despite these challenges pep has been able to grow year over year net revenue taking a look at their last annual report we can see that net revenue increased by 6 year over year most importantly free cash flow has increased by 39 year over year totaling 81b pep has boosted their free cash flow by shaving down expenses through different costsaving initiates and job layoffs for instance pep continues to lay off employees within the fritolay segment as a way to offset slower sales growth and maintain profitability momentum creating a larger emphasis on cash during times where the sector goes through lower sales volume helps put pep in an ideal situation to manage these headwinds efficiently if pep is able to maintain this level of free cash flow growth going forward theres a likely chance that the dividend will also continue to grow at a sufficient pace this free cash flow can also be used to increase capital expenditure to continue growing their strong portfolio of products capital spending did increase 6 year over year and this trend is likely to continue as it attracts new customers through new products and promotions they are able to grow these cash flow levels by implementing price increases in all segments across all regions of operations while this was a good way to offset lower volumes throughout the pandemic era i dont know how necessary these price increases are to maintain growth going forward as interest rates are cut and inflation continues to cool these things may serve as a catalyst to higher consumer spending weve already seen inflation tick down for two consecutive months and this could give the consumer a bit of relief which translates to an increased likelihood of sales volumes increasing the higher volume of spending could eliminate the absolute need to continue increasing prices i stay cautious that squeezing customers too much could cause them to shift their focus to cheaper alternatives in the snack and beverage category pep annual report pep will be announcing their q2 earnings on july 11th and i believe that the quarter will show continued strength in their balance sheet even if sales are slumped since pep continues to prioritize strong cash management i think theres a possibility that we see free cash flow grow earnings per share for their q1 results amounted to 148 but q2 has historically been a stronger quarter for pep this leads me to believe that its possible we can see a higher eps of at least 210 220 which would align with the consensus eps estimate of 216 q2 earnings per share has continued to grow year after year since 2020 after all the fiscal year guidance still sees an estimated 4 increase in organic revenue and an 8 increase in core constant earnings per share seeking alpha liquidity remains strong however with cash and equivalents totaling 8b as of the latest report for reference pep ended the year 2022 with cash equivalents sitting at 49b additionally when rates were near zero levels in 2020 their longterm debt total sat at 403b but this has since come down to 377b which is more ideal in this high interest rate environment pep should be able to navigate these headwinds as cash from operations totals 1279b and cash per share sits at 585 which sits well above the sector median of 163 vulnerabilities comparison interest rates remain a vulnerability to consumerfacing companies like pep its no coincidence that as interest rates were cut to near zero levels in 2020 the price of pep started to rapidly appreciate consistently until interest rates started to get hiked throughout the course of 2022 interest rates were consistently increased and as rates approached their peak peps price lost its upward momentum and eventually retracted back to the current level and stabilized data by ycharts interest rates increase the cost of borrowing and may slow any growth initiatives that pep may want to pursue their longterm debt sits at one of the highest levels ever over the last decade now totaling 377b if portions of this debt were issued on a floating rate bases this would mean that it is more expensive to maintain this debt balance as interest payments would rise on the consumer side of things higher interest rates also contribute to lowered consumer spend taking a look at the consumer price index changes we can see that food related costs have increased by about 25 between 2019 to 2023 as a result this may cause lots of consumers to shift their spending to cheaper alternatives this is a huge vulnerability since there are plenty of storebranded alternative potato chip and soda options out there there is survey data to support the fact that 54 of shoppers say theyll choose storebranded grocery items as a substitute for national brands usda store branded alternatives are typically cheaper which adds to their appeal during these unfavorable market conditions i imagine that a lot of consumers out there are able to stomach the marginal difference in taste and quality of these snack and soda products if it means they get to save a bit of money as mentioned the continual price increases that pep has been implementing have a finite lifespan and itll eventually tire the consumer and cause them to shift their dollars elsewhere the consumer sector continues to underperform the rest of the market but pep has remained one of the top choices in the sector just to serve as a comparison ive grouped together some beverage and snack peers that operate in similar market spaces we can see that the revenue growth of pep has outpaced these peers totaling 36 over a fiveyear span data by ycharts even when comparing the total return over the last five years we can see that pep is on the top end of the range only being beat by cocacola however ko has a much slower dividend growth rate and doesnt have as steady of an earnings growth performance since the pandemic data by ycharts even when looking at the dividend growth over the last five years pep also remains at the top end of the range the combination of these performance metrics makes pep the most wellbalanced option to gain exposure to the consumer sector pep provides an excellent level of dividend growth revenue consistency cash and equivalents buffer and strong pricing strategy that has offset lower volumes data by ycharts the recovery valuation pep remains attractive priced in terms of valuation metrics peps valuation has always traded at a premium to the sector medians so in this case it would be more appropriate to compare pep to its own fiveyear average ratios for instance pep currently trades at a price to earnings ratio of 247x compared against the sector median price to earnings ratio of 196x however peps fiveyear average price to earnings ratio is closer to 265x in addition peps price to book ratio sits at 118x which undercuts its fiveyear average price to book ratio of 136x these metrics may indicate that there is some upside to be captured here when conditions in the sector improve wall st analysts seem to agree with this consensus based on their average price target of 18503 per share this would represent a potential 125 price upside from the current level the highest price target sits at 210 per share while the lowest price target sits at 151 per share in order to get another source of reference for an estimated price target i also wanted to run a discounted cash flow calculation free cash flow per share sits at 527 and while management provided an estimated eps growth target of 8 i wanted to manage expectations and consider any potential underperformance therefore i thought a 7 estimated growth rate was a reasonable input here i wanted to keep the estimated growth rate at 7 even after the initial two years in the table below so that expectations can be aligned with the sector median the yearoveryear median ebitda growth for the sector sits at 69 additionally peps own fiveyear average revenue growth is about 725 so i think that using a 7 baseline growth rate is totally reasonable when looking forward money chimp with these inputs in mind we come to an estimated fair value of 18796 per share from the current price level this indicates a potential upside of over 14 which closely aligns to the wall st price target when you consider this potential upside is accompanied by a growing dividend we have the opportunity to capture a doubledigit return by accumulating here pepsi dividend growth peps management has proven to value the dividend growth by maintaining consistent raises pep recently increased their dividend by 7 and the latest quarterly dividend sits at 1355 per share making the current dividend yield 33 the dividend remains wellsupported despite the ongoing headwinds the payout ratio currently sits at 66 which is aligned with the fiveyear average payout ratio of 67 i believe that the payout ratio can be improved once sales start to increase and operating profit margins improve as long as the payout ratio doesnt rise above the 70 mark i feel confident that pep will be able to maintain pep has crossed into dividend king territory by consecutively raising dividends for over 51 years in a row the dividend growth has been quite solid and delivers the level of growth sufficient enough to compound dividend income over time for instance the dividend has increased at a cagr compound annual growth rate of 81 over the last ten years even on a smaller time frame of five years the dividend has increased at a cagr of 66 this level of consistent growth makes it ideal for dividend growth investors that wish to have a source of reliable dividend income to visualize this i ran a back test of a 10000 investment over the last year this graph also assumes that you added a fixed monthly contribution of 500 to your investment as well as reinvested all dividends back into pep to help accumulate more shares and compound your income quicker portfolio visualizer in 2015 your dividend income would have totaled 392 fast forwarding to 2023 reveals that through a combination of a longterm outlook and continual accumulation of more shares your dividend income would have now grown to 3178 this means that your income would have almost 10xed over the last decade holding period most importantly the dividends received from pep are classified as qualified dividends this means that the income received from pep would be treated at the most favorable tax rates this is what makes pep such a valuable holding for investors looking to eventually retire off their dividend income takeaway in conclusion pep remains a compelling buy at these levels the companys efficient cash management and ability to continue growing revenue in unfavorable conditions is a testament to the high quality here the upcoming earnings will likely show continual improvements in the balance sheet as cash equivalents grow while debt gets eliminated from a valuation standpoint i think there is the potential for a solid doubledigit upside to be captured here which can be fueled by the eventual increase in sales volume from lower interest rates the combination of lower interest rates and cooling inflation should ultimately contribute to earnings growth moving forward in the meantime i plan to continue collecting a growing stream of dividends until market conditions improve,,,,,,,,Very Old

Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-phenomenal-stock-could-join-090100044.html,the pace of artificial intelligence ai adoption has only accelerated over the past year and has shuffled the ranks of some of the worlds largest companies with several household names vying for bragging rights microsoft currently leads the pack having unseated apple each with a market cap of roughly 34 trillion nvidias rise through the ranks has been breathtaking to behold having nearly tripled over the past year to take the third spot at 3 trillion several other major purveyors of ai namely alphabet amazon and meta platforms boast valuations of between 13 trillion and 23 trillion with a market cap of just 49 billion as of this writing it might seem like sacrilege to propose that super micro computer nasdaq smci also called supermicro might be headed for the 1 trillion club however the accelerating adoption of ai has increased the need for servers capable of running and training ai systems and the companys long track record of success makes supermicro a clear candidate for inclusion in this elite fraternity image source getty images flexible server options while supermicro has made a splash in recent years investors might be surprised to learn the company has been creating customized servers for more than three decades the accelerating adoption of generative ai shone a spotlight on the undertheradar server maker bringing it out of the shadows supermicros claim to fame is the companys highly customizable buildingblock architecture which helps the company provide server solutions for customers of all sizes and shapes furthermore supermicros long focus on energy efficiency has taken on greater significance as cost becomes a factor it also offers a variety of freeair liquidcooling and traditional aircooling technologies giving each customer just what theyre looking for the company has partnerships with all the leading chipmakers giving it access to the most indemand ai processors this includes strong working relationships with nvidia advanced micro devices and intel among others this approach has served the company well for its fiscal 2024 third quarter ended march 31 supermicros revenue surged 200 year over year to 385 billion while its earnings per share eps of 665 jumped 308 management is guiding that its tripledigit growth will continue raising its fullyear guidance to revenue of 149 billion and adjusted eps of 2369 which would represent growth of 109 and 100 respectively management reports that supermicro is growing at nearly 20 times the industry average which clearly shows the company is taking market share from the competition analysts at bank of america agree suggesting supermicro will increase its market share from 10 last year to 17 by 2026 story continues the path to 1 trillion supermicro is one of the premier names in the ai server market the companys agility has been paramount in taking share from its rivals as its buildingblock server architecture means it has something for everyone supermicro has also established critical partnerships with the chipmakers that supply the company with the most requested processors giving it ample supply to meet the accelerating demand despite those advantages it will still be some time before supermicro ascends the ranks to become a trillionaire according to wall street supermicro is poised to generate revenue of 149 billion in 2024 giving it a forward pricetosales ps ratio of roughly 33 assuming its ps remains constant supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about 305 billion annually to support a 1 trillion market cap its important to put this in context the company is ramping up its production capabilities just to be able to generate sales of 25 billion annually so a nearly 20fold increase in revenue is still off in the distant future if the company were able to keep up its tripledigit yearoveryear growth rate supermicro could reach the 1 trillion market cap by 2029 however keeping up that frantic pace of growth for five years would be unparalleled for a wellestablished company yet even if we cut its growth rate in half supermicro could hypothetically reach a 1 trillion market cap by 2032 while that might sound farfetched the evidence suggests its more likely than you might think bofa analyst ruplu bhattacharya posited the ai data center market will grow at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 50 over the coming three years and by taking share from its rivals supermicros revenue could grow even faster hes not the only one who thinks the data center upgrade cycle is about to take off nvidia ceo jensen huang believes the installed base of data centers will double to 2 trillion over the next four to five years to support the

A0462,2024-07-07,309,"Generative AI Sales Could Soar 2,040%: My Pick for the Best AI Stock to Buy Now (Hint: Not Nvidia)",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/generative-ai-sales-could-soar-081200004.html,generative artificial intelligence ai uses large language models and other machine learning models to create text images video audio and computer code use cases range from digital assistants that improve worker productivity to intelligent avatars that make video games more lifelike bloomberg intelligence expects generative ai revenue to exceed 13 trillion in 2032 up from 635 billion in 2023 put differently bloomberg believes spending across generative ai hardware software and services will surge 2040 over the next nine years some analysts see an even bigger market for instance mckinsey company research suggests generative ai will eventually contribute 79 trillion annually to the global economy opportunities like that come along rarely so investors should position their portfolios accordingly nvidia nasdaq nvda is a logical stock to own in fact i think most investors should have some exposure to the chipmaker but nvidia is by no means the only company that will benefit and owning a single ai stock is a poor strategy heres why i think super micro computer nasdaq smci is the best ai stock to buy now nvidia dominates the market for artificial intelligence processors nvidia graphics processing units gpus have long been the gold standard in accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence the spotlight has certainly intensified over the past year given that nvidias revenue and net income have grown at a tripledigit pace for four consecutive quarters but investors should understand that nvidia did not stumble mindlessly into its recent success nvidia has dominated the data center gpu market for nearly two decades and the company has been setting performance records at the mlperfs objective benchmarks that measure how quickly ai systems can perform ai training and inference tasks since those tests were created in 2018 one reason for that success is the cuda programming language which lets nvidia gpus originally built for computer graphics accelerate other data center workloads nvidia introduced cuda in 2006 and the platform has since expanded to include hundreds of frameworks and software libraries that streamline data preparation model training and ai application development no other chipmaker has a supporting software ecosystem that is remotely comparable so nvidia has naturally emerged as the leader in ai processors to quote the wall street journal nvidia chips underpin all of the most advanced ai systems giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80 story continues the problem if there is one is valuation wall street expects nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33 annually over the next three to five years if that number is divided into its current pricetoearnings ratio of 74 the result is a priceearningstogrowth ratio peg ratio of 22 that is not exorbitant in fact that multiple is a discount to the threeyear average of 31 so risktolerant investors should consider buying a small position today however i think super micro also called supermicro is the better buy right now because the stock is much cheaper yet the company stands to benefit greatly as businesses invest in generative ai hardware supermicro is gaining share in the artificial intelligence server market supermicro builds accelerated computing platforms its portfolio spans individual servers and storage systems to fullrack solutions purposebuilt for enterprise and cloud data centers the company works closely with partners like nvidia intel and advanced micro devices to equip its hardware with the latest chips samik chatterjee at jpmorgan chase sees supermicro as the leading company in the ai compute market more importantly supermicro is quickly gaining market share the company accounted for 10 of ai server sales through the quarter ended in december but tom blakely at keybanc says that figure could reach 23 this year he also believes supermicro has competitive moats that should sustain if not expand this share in coming years blakely is referring to internal manufacturing capabilities and a unique buildingblock approach to product development engineers comprise about half of supermicros workforce and the company handles most research and development internally in silicon valley in turn supermicro can quickly and efficiently bring new products to market and its modular approach only enhances that ability specifically supermicro is often first to market with new technologies because it can quickly assemble a broad portfolio of solutions by leveraging common building blocks across product lines in other words the company can quickly outfit partially preassembled servers with the latest central processing units cpus gpus memory and interconnects such that it often beats its competitors to market ceo charles liang recently highlighted that advantage we provide optimized ai solutions at scale offering a timetomarket advantage and shorter lead times over our competition supermicro trades at a more reasonable valuation than nvidia the number of annual ai server shipments is expected to increase sixfold between 2023 and 2028 according to 650 group supermicro is well positioned to benefit as demand increases given its market leadership which itself is supported by internal engineering capabilities and a unique approach to product development wall street expects supermicro to grow earnings per share at 48 annually over the next three to five years if that number is divided into its current valuation of 47 times earnings the result is a peg ratio below 1 to be clear supermicro is not a hidden gem in fact it was the bestperforming stock in the sp 500 during the first half of 2024 but its valuation is very reasonable especially compared to nvidias peg ratio of 22 should you invest 1000 in nvidia right now before you buy stock in nvidia consider this the motley fool stock advisor analyst team

A0463,2024-07-07,309,Prediction: 2 AI Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Palantir 3 Years From Now,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-2-ai-stocks-thatll-083500685.html,palantir technologies nyse pltr stock price has rallied about 50 this year as the data analytics company dazzled the bulls with its accelerating revenue growth and soaring profits its revenue rose 17 in 2023 and it expects 2021 growth in 2024 as its government business stabilizes and its us commercial business accelerates its also stayed profitable for six consecutive quarters and analysts anticipate 71 earnings growth this year from 2023 to 2026 analysts expect palantir to grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 20 as its eps increases at a cagr of 56 that rosy outlook along with palantirs growth potential in the ai market drove its stock higher image source getty images but palantirs stock isnt cheap right now at 21 times this years sales and it could struggle to maintain those premium valuations if the macro and competitive headwinds throttle its nearterm growth so if youre worried the stock will lose its luster again you should check out two less valuable ai companies that might just be worth more than palantir in three years super micro computer nasdaq smci and baidu nasdaq bidu what do these two ai companies do super micro computer more commonly known as supermicro produces highperformance liquidcooled servers for demanding data center tasks it generates about half of its revenue from dedicated ai servers and its longterm partnership with nvidia grants it access to the chipmakers new data center gpus before many of its top competitors bank of america expects its share of the dedicated ai server market to grow from 10 to 17 over the next three years baidu owns the largest online search engine in china it also owns a majority share of iqiyi one of the countrys leading streaming video platforms the apollo software platform for autonomous vehicles and the baidu ai cloud platform it generates most of its revenue from online ads but its been diversifying that core business with managed business pages which empower it to manage a clients entire brand presence within its ecosystem to reduce its dependence on traditional search and display ads its also beefing up its mobile app with more tools and expanding its nonmarketing cloud ai and other division to reduce its exposure to the macrosensitive advertising market why could these two companies become more valuable than palantir supermicro and baidu could become more valuable than palantir because they both look cheaper relative to their estimated sales growth over the next three years story continues company market cap pricetosales ratio current year estimated revenue cagr next 3 years palantir 576 billion 213 20 supermicro 496 billion 33 58 baidu 310 billion 16 6 data source yahoo finance marketscreener if palantir maintains its lofty pricetosales ratio through 2026 it could be worth 806 billion in a bull case scenario by 2026 but if the macro or competitive headwinds unexpectedly curb its growth its pricetosales ratio could easily be cut in half if supermicro matches analysts expectations and simply maintains the same pricetosales ratio over the next three years it could be worth about 93 billion by 2026 it should fetch an even higher valuation if its finally revalued as a highergrowth ai stock instead of just a legacy server maker like dell technologies baidus recent growth has been throttled by competitive and macro headwinds in china but its valuation is being severely compressed by the ongoing tensions between the us and china if those tensions ease we might see baidus stock trade at about 4 to 5 times its forward sales again as it did about four years ago if baidu merely matches analysts estimates and trades at about 4 times sales by 2026 it would be worth 88 billion but thats a base case scenario it could be worth a lot more if its new cloud and ai investments pay off and significantly boost its sales again but are supermicro and baidu better buys than palantir we should take those estimates with a grain of salt but they indicate that palantirs stock is more richly valued than supermicro and baidu benjamin graham said in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine i believe palantir is still in the voting phase as investors pay a premium for its aidriven features but supermicro and baidu have advanced into the weighing phase so they could both outperform palantir

This Nasdaq-100 Stock Is Most Likely to Split Next.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-broadcom-announced-10-1-091200642.html,nvidia shares have surged 760 since the beginning of 2023 and broadcom shares have surged 205 during the same period nvidia has already reset its share price by completing a 10for1 stock split on june 7 and broadcom has a 10for1 stock split planned for july 12 importantly nvidia was the fourthmost expensive stock in the nasdaq100 prior to its split and broadcom is currently the thirdmost expensive stock in the index thats not surprising the primary purpose of a forward stock split is to reduce the share price thereby making the stock more accessible and more liquid with that in mind the nasdaq100 stock most likely to split next is the one with the highest price which is booking holdings however as my colleague jon quast eloquently describes ceo glen fogel opposes the idea of a stock split so we can strike booking holdings from the list and move on to the next most expensive stock mercadolibre nasdaq meli investors should never buy a stock just because they expect it to split but mercadolibre is a worthwhile longterm investment whether it splits or not read on to see why mercadolibre is the market leader in ecommerce and retail advertising in latin america mercadolibre operates the largest online commerce and payments ecosystem in

of fulfillment and advertising services indicating that mercadolibre is more effectively monetizing merchants on its marketplace additionally fintech sales benefited from accelerating growth in total

revenue growth has accelerated in four consecutive quarters given its strong presence in several markets investors have good reason to believe mercadolibre can maintain that momentum the company is

broadly the digital economy in latin america is expected to expand at 23 annually over the next three years mercadolibre stock trades at a reasonable price compared to wall streets earnings forecast wall street expects mercadolibre to grow earnings per share at 51 annually through 2026 in that context the current valuation of 742 times earnings appears reasonable especially when the twoyear average is 1097 times earnings investors should be cognizant of the risks most notably argentina mercadolibres thirdlargest geography behind brazil and mexico is suffering from hyperinflation such that domestic sales declined 22 in the first quarter as measured in us dollars despite surging 239 as measured in argentine pesos that will likely be a headwind for the foreseeable future mercadolibre

Can It Do It Again?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-beat-nvidia-first-half-081500992.html,nvidia nasdaq nvda added to its winnings in the first half gaining about 150 after already climbing 1300 over the past five years the company dominates the artificial intelligence ai chip market holding an 80 share and also sells a variety of related products and services to companies launching ai projects this has resulted in growth with earnings advancing in the triple digits quarter after quarter as great as this sounds though nvidia isnt the best performer of the first half another stock actually soared past the chipmaker skyrocketing 188 this company also operates in the ai space and has seen earnings climb and this player actually benefits from growth of nvidia and other chip designers could this nvidia and marketbeating stock offer investors a repeat performance in the second half lets find out image source getty images serving ai data centers the player thats wowed the market in recent times actually has been around for quite a while more than 30 years to be exact im talking about super micro computer nasdaq smci a maker of servers workstations full rack scale solutions and other equipment crucial to the operations of ai data centers supermicros revenue progressively rose over the years but the ai boom marked a clear turning point helping sales and net income to skyrocket earlier this year supermicro even reported its first 3 billion quarter that was the companys annual revenue level as recently as 2021 supermicro has benefited from demand for top ai chips because customers generally need not only a chip but a variety of equipment and the company integrates these chips into its products so when nvidia or intel for example launch a new chip this creates demand for supermicros products too to maximize the benefit supermicro works handinhand with these companies monitoring their development pipelines so that it can immediately include their innovations in its equipment and supermicros building blocks process with most of its products sharing common parts also makes it easy to quickly produce equipment tailored to customers needs all of this has helped the company grow five times faster than its industry over the past 12 months theres reason to be optimistic this will continue because ai market growth is in its early days analysts predict todays 200 billion market will reach beyond 1 trillion by the end of the decade and this should translate into sustained demand for supermicros products story continues a new growth driver on top of this supermicros direct liquid cooling dlc technology may serve as a new growth driver for the company ai data centers generate a tremendous amount of heat and this situation only will worsen as workloads intensify but supermicros dlc technology solves this problem and customers now are taking notice supermicros dlc solutions increasing from zero market share to less than 1 in the companys 30year history could take as much as a 30 share over the next couple of years the taipei times reported citing the companys chief executive officer charles liang all of this means supermicros spectacular growth may be far from over and in the second half of this year nvidias release of its gamechanging new architecture blackwell and chip could offer the equipment maker a new boost supermicro recently offered a sneak peek of its blackwell products and says its focused on developing new generative ai and inferenceoptimized systems accommodating the market leaders latest chips could supermicro beat nvidia now lets get back to our question could supermicro continue to beat nvidia and the general market in the second half i think its very likely this equipment giant will outperform the market thanks to its growth prospects and position in the hot area of ai as for surpassing nvidias gains its possible in spite of supermicros firsthalf increase the company trades at a significant discount to the chip designer about 24x forward earnings estimates versus 46x for nvidia at the same time the earningspershare growth estimate of 62 for the coming five years for supermicro tops average estimates of 46 for nvidia these points could attract investors and help supermicro soar in the second half but even if this top equipment company doesnt offer us a repeat

A0468,2024-07-07,309,6 foods that could be making you age faster,Fortune,https://fortune.com/well/article/foods-that-age-you-faster/,you know that the foods you eat affect everything from your waistline to your mood new research shows how your diet may also play a role in how well you age several studies have explored the connection between popular diets and aging the mediterranean diet has been shown to slow the progression of aging and foods rich in antioxidants and nutrients like vitamin e and choline—hello nuts eggs and fish—appear to have a protective effect on cognitive health but what about foods that have the opposite effect “there’s a lot of sugar fat and salt preservatives…and other chemical compounds in a typical american diet” says raelene brooks phd rn dietician and dean of the college of nursing at the university of phoenix “those types of foods lead to an inflammatory response that can affect our dna in a negative way which can lead to aging” these six foods could make you age faster 1 coffee ned a java jolt to get going in the mornings you might want to limit it to a couple of cups coffee drinkers who consumed more than six cups of coffee per day tended to have smaller brain volume and a 53 higher risk of being diagnosed with dementia compared to coffee drinkers who filled their cups less often some research even found that each 100 mg of caffeine about the equivalent of one cup of coffee was linked to 24 years of accelerated aging but you might not need to abandon your morning cup of joe altogether “there are many more studies suggesting benefits of coffee” explains alice h lichtenstein dsc leader of the cardiovascular nutrition team at the jean mayer usda human nutrition research center on aging at tufts university in fact moderate amounts of coffee have been linked to numerous health benefits from improved muscle strength to decreased risk of cardiovascular disease some research even found that those who drank between 15 and 35 cups of coffee per day were 21 less likely to die during the study period than noncoffee drinkers 2 dairy consuming milk has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease osteoporosis and colorectal cancer but a growing number of studies have explored the downsides of dairy whole milk might be especially problematic in addition to higher rates of prostate cancer and parkinson’s disease it’s been linked to higher rates of cognitive decline in older adults and increased biological aging “whole milk has a higher fat content and there has been research linked to a higher fat diets and inflammation” brooks says “when inflammation gets triggered…the cells are not able to regenerate efficiently and start to degrade” 3 spicy foods bland diets are well bland but adding too much spice to your food might put you at higher risk of developing dementia researchers followed a group of older chinese adults for 15 years and found that those who consistently consumed more than 50 grams about ¼ cup of chili per day had lower cognitive scores than those who ate less spicy meals it might not be a worrisome finding in the united states—45 of americans expressed a preference for “mild” foods—so don’t go giving up the chili paste hot peppers and curry powder just yet but brooks does suggest opting for fresh spices and over processed options “the combination of preservatives and sodium in some packaged spices and hot sauces could affect the brain” she explains 4 sodium it’s no secret that sodium is hard on your heart “in many people excess dietary sodium increases blood pressure” says lichtenstein “high blood pressure is associated with increased risk of stroke heart disease and agerelated chronic diseases” the us dietary guidelines recommend limiting sodium intake to 2300 milligrams per day but most americans consume 50 more possibly because sodium is hiding in foods ranging from condiments and cereal to processed cheese those sneaky sources of sodium may be harming your brain diets that were high in sodium which one study defined as greater than 12000 milligrams or 21 teaspoons per day were linked to lower cognitive function and a 330 increase in the risk of cognitive impairment 5 carbohydrates have a lovehate relationship with carbs so does science the high proteinlow carb keto diet might make your organs age faster or it could improve brain performance or not even though the research is contradictory one thing is clear carbohydrates trigger an inflammatory response which has a negative impact on your health but brooks has one word for those who think aging well means giving up pasta and bread “moderation” 6 artificial sweetener you might want to skip the diet soda drinking one diet soda per day was associated with an increased risk of dementia and higher artificial sweetener consumption was linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk including heart attack and stroke lichtenstein calls the link “tenuous” and notes that it could be attributed to other risk factors including diets higher in red and processed meats and ultraprocessed foods brooks is less surprised by the results “artificial sweeteners are manmade chemicals designed to trick the brain into thinking it’s eating sugar but without the calories” she says “anytime you’ve got that type of compound that’s triggering the brain and causing inflammation it’s a negative thing” more on aging well and living longer,,,,,,,,Very Old

Daily,https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/health-fitness/how-naomi-wakhu-tailors-workouts-for-every-age-and-stage-4682344,have you thought of hiring a personal trainer or group classes at the gym are working for you many fitness enthusiasts are now opting for personal trainers to help them stay consistent with their exercises push their limits and try new things such as adding weight training cycling boxing or weightlifting to cardio workouts naomi wakhu who has been a personal trainer for 12 years says people shy away from personal trainers as they consider them to be expensive however she underscores the need for a personal trainer saying “many people nowadays prefer working with a personal trainer because they can hold you accountable and keep you motivated “a personal trainer makes work easier for you you do not have to do anything no one can pay sh3000 for a session and not get value for their money clients get to interact with their trainers oneonone she says adding that personal trainers are flexible adapting to client schedules and physical abilities and accommodating weather making it easier for them to help you achieve your fitness goals naomi wakhu does a plank on the ring workout exercise at vmx fitness gym in nairobi on july 4 2024 photo credit bonface bogita nation media group she gives an example of one of her longest customers “i have been with my longest client for five years now and i have gotten to watch her through the different phases of her life within five years she has gotten pregnant twice i have seen her body change during the first pregnancy where she lost balance and developed a weak core after her first baby she came back as she wanted to be fit and welltoned we worked on this she got pregnant again and found she was unable to do some core workouts all over again i worked with her during the pregnancy helping her hips open up now eight months after her second birth her core is strong and she has more balance this is what i love to see” says naomi who trained at the alison caroline institute international school as a fitness coach i was to meet naomi at 2pm and by 204 pm she had arrived at vmx fitness gym in nairobis village market “as a personal trainer you cannot afford to be late for appointments” she says her typical day starts at 5am and you will always find her carrying her helmet “i use bolt boda or uber boda as it helps me to manoeuvre through the heavy traffic in the city as i rush to train my clients” over the years her clients list has grown “i do trainings from monday to friday i also have online sessions on zoom because i have clients from the us brazil and germany” she says the clientele the majority of her clients are couples and elderly people “older people are more driven to stay alive and energetic older people exercise to deal with hip and back problems and they cannot go to gyms so i go to their homes others have undergone several surgeries so i help them do exercises that help rehabilitate their bodies she says the younger clients i work with are more interested in losing weight growing their glutes bulking and gaining muscle she adds having seen a gap she is now focusing on being a personal trainer for the seniors helping them with movement “working with the older generation has taught me how crucial movement is to one’s general health what matters most is your mobility even if you build muscles but your mobility is not good you are going to struggle she says the exercise plan to come up with an exercise regime for her clients because personalised exercises work best naomi first has to check their height body measurements and blood pressure and find out if they have undergone any surgeries or any injuries this helps to determine everyones workouts” naomi says adding the exercises start with warmups and end with stretches i also incorporate a lot of mobility exercises these help ensure one does not get injuries mobility exercises make the joints move and exercise your spine when you do mobility exercises your muscles stretch fast and it is easier to get results because there is better blood flow in the system finally we do the main workouts to help you build strong muscles and bones these depend entirely on what the client wants some want to lose weight add weight or just feel good” naomi says naomi wakhu does pushups at vmx fitness gym in nairobi on july 4 2024 photo credit bonface bogita nation media group the equipment so what equipment do you need if you want to work from home with a personal trainer “most of my clients have fully equipped gyms but what you must have are resistance bands ankle weights sliders and dumbbells she says but bodyweight exercises for those who have no home gyms also help one lose weight and tone their muscles i teach pilates exercises to those who have no equipment as it helps strengthen their muscles and improve flexibility she says adding that she also carries her own resistance bands dumbbells and ankle weights to spice up the pilates classes one of the fears that people have in bringing a personal trainer to their home is privacy confidentiality naomi says she signs contracts with her clients this she says protects her as she goes to train people from one home to another “i ensure that i maintain professionalism with a client i do not get too personal with my clients once we sign the contract it ensures that my interests and those of my clients are protected” she says naomi’s personal training career stemmed from frustration she was a volleyball player “immediately after high school i left my home village in busia and moved to nairobi to join a volleyball team i played volleyball for three years before things took a different turn i was one of the best players and i was sure that i would be on the list of players on the 2013 team but when the list came out my name was not there this i believe was fuelled by the fact that i had an altercation with my coach” she says naomi wakhu poses for a photo during a boxing workout at vmx fitness gym in nairobi on july 4 2024 photo credit bonface bogita nation media group the pay personal training also pays well “in 2013 i got my first client and from then on my client base has grown mainly as a result of referrals now i train at least six clients a day a session costs sh3000 but many people pay in packages so i charge sh30000 for a package of 10 sessions” the 33yearold says she adds “when i finished school i was timid and naive i didn’t know how to get started back then i would even take sh500 per session then i started getting more client referrals and this gave me confidence that i may be doing a good job” when she is not training a client in their homes you will likely find naomi at vmx fitness gym and calisthens fitness centre her fitness journey “when i started training it was all because i wanted to feel and look good but now i am more interested in my mobility” she says to improve herself naomi is currently doing callisthenics which is mainly focused on “your mobility and flexibility naomi who says that your weight is also highly dependent on what you eat has taken up a highprotein diet,,,,,,,,Very Old

A0471,2024-07-07,309,The Stock Market Is In One Giant Trade That Is Near Its End,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702753-stock-market-one-giant-trade-near-end?source=feed_all_articles,fatcamerae via getty images if the rally in the sp 500 seems confusing it shouldnt be the rally is nothing more than a handful of names continuing to push the overall concentrated index higher at this point most of the gains are driven by the volatility dispersion trade as traders play ring around the rosie with the magnificent 7 names it may seem completely random to see amazon amzn suddenly break out of trading starting on june 20 after struggling for months coming on surging call volume and rising implied volatility it must be the ai trade that is the only explanation of course however notice in the chart below how the gains seemed to stop once the call volume subsided and implied volatility leveled off bloomberg it wasnt only amazon that was in on the action microsoft msft was too with the stock price surging driven by a big move higher in implied volatility and stronger option volumes bloomberg alphabet googl goog played along the week of june 20 with similar characteristics — surging call volume activity an up movement in the stock and rising implied volatility levels bloomberg the funny thing is that when amazon microsoft and alphabet stopped tesla tsla picked it up on june 26 with a surging stock price sharply rising implied volatility levels for an atthemoney 30day option and call volume surging bloomberg on july 5 it seemed to be metas meta turn because it appears to have been neglected for the most part the stock jumped by nearly 6 percent saw its implied volatility increase and saw call volume rise more than double bloomberg this is happening as the sp 500 has continued to climb and an atthemoney 1month implied volatility for the index continued to move lower with spiking on a few occasions above the usual range bloomberg a quarterly game typically we think about a gamma squeeze when considering a surging stock price rising call volume and increasing implied volatility however when we couple the rolling gamma squeezes across multiple names in the sp 500 as implied volatility for the index is falling it has the elements of a volatility dispersion trade which has been noted before this trade is the most notable around earnings season repeating seasonal and quarterly patterns typically the implied volatility levels for these stocks rise about a month before earnings due to earnings risk and then drop sharply once earnings have passed last year this trade in meta started around the end of june with iv flattening out around july 6 it also coincided with a sharp rise in call volumes beginning on july 5 and then coming down slowly the stock price rose from around 285 to 325 then however after the results iv crashed and the stock returned to around 285 over the next couple of weeks bloomberg this pattern repeats about every quarter starting one month before the earnings season begins and ending once earnings are reported bloomberg correlations at alltime lows this is why the 1month implied correlation index has pushed on to new lows falling below 4 and is now trading nearly three handles below its previous alltime lows set in 201718 this indicates that the current implied volatility across the 50 largest companies in the sp 500 and index implied volatility levels are not moving in the same direction and the lower the value the weaker the correlation bloomberg however once implied volatility levels in the stocks peak the implied correlation index will form a local bottom and in most cases turn higher this would indicate that some kind of local bottom in the 1month implied correlation is due very soon with the potential for a turn higher bloomberg the 3month 9month and 12month implied correlation indexes often flatten out or turn higher before the 1month implied correlation indexes this has happened many times over the past year alone the 3 9 and 12month indexes could already be near a turning point bloomberg blurred vision but this rotation into these differing stocks due to this trade is why we see this endless rotation in megacap names with big moves it is noticeable too when breaking down the movements and the weightings of the stocks over those preferred time frames from june 20 until june 26 the bloomberg 500 shows that the stocks with the biggest impacts in the index a proxy for the sp 500 were amazon alphabet and microsoft with tesla in fourth this was over a stretch where 229 stocks were higher while 261 were lower bloomberg the period between june 27 and july 3 saw teslas share surge leading to the bloomberg 500s rise followed by apple and microsoft teslas shares surged by more than 25 in that small trading window adding more than 130 billion in market cap during a period where the 257 stocks were higher and just 242 stocks were lower bloomberg on july 5 apple and meta led the tracking proxy higher contributing 50 of the days gains with meta up nearly 6 this was in the midst of a massive gamma squeeze as the number of stocks higher was just 257 with 241 down bloomberg overall the bloomberg 500 gained about 16 from june 20 through july 5 during which 252 stocks moved higher and 249 stocks moved lower this was mainly due to what appears to be a volatility dispersion trade among a handful of the largest stocks in the market bloomberg so again if it seems you are seeing things with a stock de jour weekly you are not it is accurate and there is a reason for it this trade is very close to its end because of the seasonal cycles,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0472,2024-07-07,309,"Sonoco Products Stock: Selloff Is Overdone, Buy To Lock In 4.2% Yield (NYSE:SON)",Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702755-sonoco-selloff-is-overdone-buy-to-lock-in-4-2-percent-yield?source=feed_all_articles,bunhille via getty images with markets currently sitting at alltime highs it may be prudent to increase allocations to defensive sectors like consumer staples health care and utilities one of the challenges with the consumer staples segment is picking the right brand or product category sonoco products company nyseson is a packaging supplier to many of the leader consumer products companies around the globe why not get broad exposure to consumer staples without the risk of choosing a single brand or category while collecting a growing dividend and 42 yield recently the shares have sold off from a high of 6150 to just under 50 on news that the company is acquiring eviosys a private equity owned company that was acquired from crown holdings cck in 2021 i think the selloff is too steep and the shares offer a compelling valuation company overview sonoco has been an innovator in packaging technology for 125 years and as a proof point they have received over 500 patents just since 2020 the company produces four categories of packaging and they focus on the segment of the broader packaging industry that is considered valueadd this means that they are not just a raw material paper supplier or steel producer which are relatively more prone to commodity price cycles sonoco 2024 investor day presentation after the close of the eviosys acquisition the combined company will generate about 92 billion in revenue rigid paper containers will constitute about 16 of revenue metal packaging 38 flexibles and thermoforming 14 and industrial paper packaging 27 the remaining 5 is other and is a variety of packaging materials including plastic paper foam and various other specialty materials why the market is sour on eviosys acquisition the selloff in son shares actually started prior to the acquisition announcement so we cant attribute all of the downturn to this that said shares opened 23 on the day of the announcement june 24th and traded as low as 57 theyve continued to drift lower to where they are now down about 106 since the acquisition news clearly the market does not like the deal and we need to understand why sonoco is paying 39 billion and funding it via the sale of 27 billion in new bonds issuance of 500 million of common equity and a 700 million term loan management also communicated that they will be raising 1 billion of cash from divesting noncore businesses including the thermosafe business depending on the timing of the sale of these businesses management said that they may not need the 700 million term loan but that even if they do they expect to pay it off in 3 months sonoco eviosys ma call presentation more debt and share dilution the bad looking at the new capital structure after the acquisition and the divestitures we see that son will carry 36x net debt to ebitda the common share count will also increase from 983 million to about 109 million assumes 10 million shares sold at 50 per share for proceeds of 500 million i also wonder if the market is skeptical of the strategic rationale for this purchase while eviosys does add scale in metal packaging when combined with the metal can business that son bought from ball in 2022 would it have been better to find an acquisition in the rigid paper packaging market where management says that the longterm growth rate is higher see above graphic accretive to earnings cash flow and no impact to investment grade rating the good managements strategic case for the acquisition is that it will create a more focused company better able to serve global customers and weighted more heavily towards consumeroriented end markets 70 financially they project that the combined company will generate higher ebitda margins of 17 or more from 16 today accretive by 25 to consensus 2025 eps based on 100 million of cost synergies and increase of 350mm free cash flow in 2025 on the ma call the cfo confirmed that the eps forecast includes the impact of the share dilution moodys and sp confirm ig rating on close and forecast is that leverage ratio will be under 30x in 24 months post close notably the cfo believes that the cost of debt on the new bonds will be in the vicinity of 45 aided by the fact that they will be eurodenominated and they will hedge some of the offering the 100 million synergy goal is very conservative in my opinion management indicated that a large portion of it will come from enhanced purchasing power and procurement savings especially in the large steel spend compelling valuation and dividend record the new sonoco will primarily 81 of revenue be a metal container and paperboardrigid paper manufacturer as such ive built a set of peers using the comparison tool on seeking alpa that you can access here sonoco trades at lowest forward pe on a gaap eps basis secondlowest forward evebitda lowest pricecash flow ttm seeking alpha comparison the valuation discount is not justified by poor performance sonoco is in the middle to upper half of the pack on profitability metrics with a clear path towards hitting 17 ebitda margins seeking alpha comparison in years past shares have generally traded for over 10 times cash flow with the exception of the pandemic period in 2020 to early 2021 the longrun average for the industry seems to hover around 7 to 8 times cash flow seeking alpha charting at this depressed valuation you are paid to wait for operating results to continue improving while collecting a 42 dividend yield sonoco is the king of dividends in its industry at the current share price the dividend yield is higher than where it has been during 96 of the past twenty years i like that management has expressly declared that the dividend is foundational and that they believe it drives discipline and creates shareholder value better yet 99 years of paying a dividend and 41 years of increasing it bring serious credibility to these statements koyfin percentile rank dataset over those 41 years the dividend has increased at just over 10 compounded annually while i dont expect that the dividend can continue growing at that rate i do think a 4 growth rate is very achievable and it is just a tad lower than the growth rate over the past 5 years the global population is projected to increase from 76 billion to 98 billion by 2050 or about 1 annually combine population growth with inflation of around 3 and real economic growth on top of that and a 4 dividend growth rate seems conservative growth outlook to 2028 the stock price probably does not show much improvement until management delivers on their goals for the acquisition namely paying down the debt and increasing operating margins as well as showing inline or better revenue growth i think management has done a good job streamlining the business having shed some noncore operations like timber lands and reorganizing from 20 business units to the current 4 core ones at the 2024 investor day management outlined a plan to increase adjusted ebitda by about 40 to 15 billion by 2028 the previously communicated target of 15 billion in ebitda will be revised upward with the acquisition to about 19 billion the plan to achieve the higher margins is built on investments in automation bringing regional backoffice shared services into one global center and reducing the number of erp systems from six to three looking out to 2028 i think the company can earn 760 million and with 109 million shares that translates to eps of 692 only one analyst on the street provides a 2028 forecast and it is at 744 gaap eps with some improvement in the pe multiple to 12 to 15 times shares could rise to between 83 and 104 without any valuation multiple expansion we still pocket the dividend yield and earnings growth signs of selloff is nearing the end the question is whether this is a value trap or is the floor in for the share price and thus presenting a good entry point one indication that the floor may be in or that we are near it is that a large institutional buyer seems to have bought the stock on the friday before the acquisition announcement which is a little fishy perhaps shares were trading down through a key support level at 56 all day and then in the last hour volume surged driving the shares back up over 1 before the close tradingviewcom this pattern of buying in the last 30 minutes of the trading day has continued the past week and i think the shares are stabilizing between 48 and 50 where support has rested in the past too risks and flags we need to watch and see where the cost of debt for the upcoming bond sale prices if it lands higher than the mid 4 range andor the company does not maintain its investment grade rating it is a sign of doubt from the credit market and would definitely impair the stock price there is also a risk that the company is unable to achieve at least 1 billion in proceeds from divestitures of noncore businesses thus impacting the ability and timing for the company to pay off the 700 million term loan right now the mergers acquisitions market is fair in my opinion and deals are getting done that could change quickly with a market selloff and if investors move to a risk off sentiment third while company revenues are geared towards consumer staples endmarkets it is categorized in the materials sector for the market which is generally viewed as procyclical any downturn in the economy could cause broadbased selling of materials stocks and sonoco shares could get dragged further down and not benefit from a rotation into consumer staples and other defensive sectors conclusion this is a stock for value investors or those who want to rotate into a consumer staples supply chain for defensive reasons given the market conditions right now its not often that you get to buy a company that has been paying a dividend for nearly 100 years and continues to increase the dividend for 41 years and counting at a compelling valuation its also a company that seems to have a reasonably good culture and my experience is that you dont last for 125 years if you dont treat people well i like their motto people build businesses by doing the right things,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0473,2024-07-07,309,Where Will Tesla Stock Be in 5 Years?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-tesla-stock-5-years-091400789.html,share prices of tesla nasdaq tsla are up roughly 21 in five days since it was reported that secondquarter vehicle deliveries beat wall streets expectations however the electric vehicle ev manufacturers longerterm downward trend remains in effect as it grapples with high interest rates competition and other macroeconomic factors could the secondquarter deliveries indicate a sustainable recovery or will tesla continue fading out lets explore what the next five years could have in store for this innovative ev leader secondquarter deliveries beat expectations or did they tesla investors dont have to wait until earnings expected to be released this month to get updated on the companys performance management typically releases production and delivery data along with other vehicle manufacturers on a quarterly basis it used to be released monthly and the muchanticipated secondquarter numbers were no exception with 443956 cars delivered in the second quarter tesla beat wall streets consensus forecast of 439000 but this is still down 48 from the prioryear period and represents the second consecutive quarter of declining deliveries after a 13 yearoveryear drop in the first quarter the betterthanexpected delivery numbers sparked a doubledigit percentage rally in the stock price but the automaker is not out of the woods yet the extent of the weakness could be revealed when the company releases its full quarterly report several key problems might come up first is pricing automakers can drive volume growth by lowering prices but this can come at the expense of revenue per car sold and margins for tesla this could pose a big problem because its previously high margins are the main thing differentiating it from its uninspiring massmarket rivals in the first quarter its operating margins fell from 114 to 55 and continued declines could turn the company into just another automaker musk to the rescue with a pricetosales ps multiple of 633 its stock trades at a significant premium over the typical large us automaker for context ford motor company and general motors trade for a ps of just 03 and 036 respectively and if tesla becomes just another car company it could lose much of its 560 billion valuation shareholders are betting that ceo elon musk wont let this happen fresh off securing an equitybased pay package worth 449 billion musk is incentivized to do everything possible to boost the stock price he seems to be downplaying the automotive opportunity in favor of new growth drivers like robotics and artificial intelligence ai story continues image source getty images the company is working on dojo a supercomputer designed to help train its machinelearning models for full selfdriving fsd while tesla isnt the only company tackling this effort it has some advantages because of the vast amount of user data it can gather from its customers with fsd software installed in their cars musk says its robotaxi will be revealed on aug 8 along with its nextgen vehicle platform if the robotaxis are consumerready they could unlock a new nonautomotive revenue stream for tesla while putting it in a prime position to explore other ai uses like warehouse automation or possibly even humanoid robots over the next five years and beyond is the stock a buy tesla has once again become a highly speculative company if current trends continue its previously highmargin ev business could become commodified over the next five years amid rising competition and lower pricing power this isnt enough to justify the stocks forward pricetoearnings pe ratio of 57 compared to the nasdaq composites average pe of 32 investors who buy the stock now are betting on elon musk and his ability to transform the company into more than just an automaker through ai and robotics this is a tall order and the controversial executive has a track record of overpromising and underdelivering with that said musk has rescued tesla from the brink on several occasions so there is good reason for the market to have

A0476,2024-07-07,309,Could Kamala Harris beat Donald Trump in November's presidential race? By Reuters,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/could-kamala-harris-beat-donald-trump-in-novembers-presidential-race-3509543,by nandita bose jeff mason and bianca flowers washington reuters she worries republican donors has name recognition and democratic party heavyweights are beginning to line up behind her vice president kamala harris would be president joe bidens natural successor if he bowed to growing pressure and stepped aside as the democratic candidate in the 2024 election top democrats say now party donors activists and officials are asking does she have a better chance than biden of beating donald trump biden is staying in the race he has said repeatedly harris 59 a former us senator and california attorney general would be the first woman to become president of the united states if she were the partys nominee and prevailed in the nov 5 election she is the first african american and asian person to serve as vice president her threeandahalfyear white house tenure has been characterized by a lackluster start staff turnover and early policy portfolios including migration from central america that did not produce major successes as recently as last year many inside the white house and the biden campaign team privately worried harris was a liability for the campaign the situation has changed significantly since then democratic officials have said as she stepped forward on abortion rights and courted young voters some polls favor harris recent polls suggest harris could do better than biden against trump the republican candidate although she would face a tight contest a cnn poll released on july 2 found voters favor trump over biden by six percentage points 49 to 43 harris also trailed trump 47 to 45 within the margin of error it also found independents back harris 4340 over trump and moderate voters of both parties prefer her 5139 a reutersipsos poll after last weeks televised debate between trump and a faltering biden found harris and trump were nearly tied with 42 supporting her and 43 backing him only former first lady michelle obama who has never expressed any interest in getting into the race polled higher among possible alternatives to biden internal polling shared by the biden campaign after the debate shows harris with the same odds as biden of beating trump with 45 of voters saying they would vote for her versus 48 for trump influential democrats including us representative jim clyburn the man who was key to bidens 2020 win rep gregory meeks a new york congressman and senior member of the congressional black caucus and summer lee a house democrat from pennsylvania have signaled harris would be the best option to lead the ticket if biden chooses to step aside house minority leader hakeem jeffries has also privately signaled the same to lawmakers a congressional aide said harris is taken so seriously two republican donors told reuters they would prefer for trump to face biden than her i would prefer biden to stay in place rather than be replaced by harris said pauline lee a fundraiser for trump in nevada after the june 27 debate who said she thought biden had proved himself to be incompetent and some on wall street an important democratic fundraising center are starting to indicate a preference biden is already behind trump and is unlikely to be able to overcome that gap given where his campaign is currently having vp harris likely improves democrats odds of taking the white house said sonu varghese global macro strategist at carson group a financial services company after the debate theres potentially more upside for her chances than bidens at this point a majority of americans see harris in a negative light as they do both men running for president polling outlet five thirty eight said 371 of voters approve of harris and 496 disapprove those numbers compare to 369 and 571 for biden and 386 and 536 for trump women black voters gaza since the supreme court repealed womens constitutional right to abortion in 2022 harris has become the biden administrations foremost voice on reproductive rights an issue democrats are betting on to help them win the 2024 election some democrats believe harris could energize democraticleaning groups whose enthusiasm for biden has faded including black voters young voters and those who do not approve of bidens handling of the israelhamas war she would energize the black brown and asian pacific members of our coalitionshe would immediately pull the dispirited youth of our country back into the fold said tim ryan a former democratic congressman from ohio in a recent oped democratic and republican suburban women may also be more comfortable with her then trump or biden he said as vice president harriss public israel strategy is identical to bidens although she was the first senior leader of the us government to call for a ceasefire in march simply swapping out the candidate does not address the central concern of the movement said abbas alawieh a member of the national uncommitted movement that withheld votes for biden in the primary based on his support of israel if biden were to step aside there could be a competition between other democrats to become the nominee if the party were then to choose another candidate over harris some democrats say it could lose the support of many black voters who were critical to bidens election win in 2020 there is no alternative besides kamala harris said adrianne shropshire executive director of black voter outreach group blackpac if the democratic party thinks that they have problems now with their base being confused jump over the black woman the vice president and i dont think the democratic party actually recovers too lefty however harris may struggle to reel in moderate democrats and the independent voters who like bidens centrist policies some democratic donors said both parties seek independents to help pull them over the finishing line in presidential elections her greatest weakness is that her public brand has been associated with the far left wing of the democratic party and the left wing of the democratic party cannot win a national election said dmitri mehlhorn a fundraiser and adviser to linkedin cofounder and democratic megadonor reid hoffman that is the challenge that she will have to overcome if she is the nominee harris would take over money raised by the biden campaign and inherit campaign infrastructure a critical advantage with just four months before election day on nov 5 but any democratic campaign still needs to raise hundreds of millions of dollars more before november to be successful strategists say and there harris could be a liability i can tell you we have a really tough time raising money for her said a source at the democratic national committee as a presidential candidate ahead of the 2020 election harris lagged biden in raising money she dropped out of the race in december 2019 the same month her campaign reported 393 million in total contributions bidens campaign reported 609 million in the same period however bidens campaign raised a record 48 million in the 24 hours after he named harris as his running mate in 2020 harriss prosecutorial background could shine in a headtohead debate against trump some democrats said she is incredibly focused and forceful and smart and if she prosecutes the case against the criminality of donald trump she will rip him apart said mehlhorn republican attacks on harris are ramping up as she has been floated as a possible biden replacement conservative talking heads are recirculating criticism leveled at her during the 2020 race including from some democrats that harris laughs too much that she is untested and unqualified kelly dittmar a political science professor at rutgers university said the attacks are part of a long history of objectifying and denigrating women of color in politics unfortunately the reliance on both racist and sexist attacks and tropes against women running for office is historically common and persists to this day said dittmar,,,,,,,,Very Old

everything,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/07/cramer-stop-worrying-and-learn-to-love-the-triumph-of-big-tech-.html,if you still doubt the power that the biggest stocks have over this market fridays performance should dispel it meta platforms added 2995 or 58 bumping its gain this year to more than 528 amazon rallied 241 or 12 and is now up roughly 316 in 2024 alphabet increased 478 or 25 for a yeartodate return of more than 366 microsoft put on 679 or 14 and is up 248 for the year apple tacked on 479 or 21 to give it a 179 gain they are simply staggering gains for these megacap tech stocks in the portfolio sure nvidia shed a few bucks on friday as the chipmaker continues to adjust to its 10for1 split but the stock is still up 1541 for year by comparison the broadbased s p 500 index is up 157 while the more techheavy nasdaq composite gained 222 put aside for a moment that we also own eli lilly shares of the drugmaker rose 1647 18 on friday bringing its total gain for the year to 574 — despite a vicious and gratuitously political attack by president joe biden biden who has waged a notsosubtle war on pharma since taking office on tuesday called on lilly and novo nordisk to cut the prices of their weightloss and diabetes drugs this is a triumph of titan tech over everything everything in the world how much of this rally is based on the strength of recent earnings versus a belief that earnings will not dissipate if gross domestic product slows with a concomitant decline in inflation the latter is something the june consumer price index cpi which comes out thursday could prove dispositive the answer is that these tech giants — plus lilly because of its explosive glp1 franchise thats way out in front of its competition — are viewed as triumphant regardless of the economys direction they are sainted plain and simple unlike the world of sports wall street is a place of theses we may think for example that there are elite teams within the purity of the national football league we ascribe their successes to management teams placing the best players on the field and moving them correctly we dont say they have a secular wind at their backs on wall street we have to attribute gains to something more than managements skill in putting the best products on the field and then moving them correctly we dont say apples business is much better than we thought we say that apple can transcend the economy because its consumer business is so strong that its colleagues — not competitors but colleagues — will shower it with the ai they have spent billions of dollars to build the only question is which ai company will pay apple the most to access the 22 billion active users of its devices because enterprise isnt big enough to continue its dominance these are companies that invent amazing franchises — youtube reels amazon web services copilot — that can manage the obstacles of a slowdown there are a few others costco and walmart are both up about 34 this year by capturing the zeitgeist of a frugal consumer in an economic squeeze of course theres the effervescent tesla the unsinkable brainchild of elon musk once again back in the black sheerly out of a cult of personality how dare anyone doubt his alchemy but the theses the endless theses they are almost novelistic — more fantasy than fact — in discrediting the ability of the best to get better they keep coming back to one main point you cant have these companies dominate without something bad happening to the stock market the lack of a belief that the ascension of these stocks is actually good for the market is a given do you ever hear thank heavens for these stocks nah its all about the impossibility of their ability to continue to dominate without a decline of some magnitude — perhaps a decline of great magnitude let me present a different factual manifesto the companies with these amazing gains are companies that just dont stop inventing there is never a moment when something new isnt working for them their stocks beat the averages because their businesses based on innovation and not financial engineering transcend the innovations of others is it really a fluke that the most inventive of pharmaceutical companies rivals the performance of the lower capitalized of these megacaps i dont think so theres a twofold pernicious nature to the denigration of a market based on the advances of a sainted few the first is that these stocks have gotten ridiculously overvalued and the second is that no one in his or her right mind would invest in a market dominated by a handful of stocks let me attack these two points the first one is true to some degree how did apple tack on such a high multiple 34 times earnings when we are used to 23 times at best the triumph of the consumer market over the enterprise but the multiples of alphabet and meta in the mid20s dont seem that expensive what are we supposed to pay for the best of the best in amazon and microsoft other than twice the market multiple and then a tad more i dont know like nvidia they might turn out to be cheap on next years numbers or we just dont know how to value them so we just pay the max amount like courtside nba tickets or a box on the fiftyyard line far more important to me why the heck does it matter to the overall market if you have most of the new money indexed what do you expect every new dollar is in more than quarters to these companies you want them to become smaller then you need index money to come out of the market but we all accept that most indexed money is sticky if not epoxied to the s p 500 so whats the deal why not complain about passive investing as the culprit and not some nonexistent cult of the titan you know my bias these are the best in good times and bad but their incredible market caps have much more to do with money in than with some sort of freak scenario that will be undone by events or treasury auctions like the 10year and the 30year we have this week in that sense i have had to adopt a quit your complaining view of their strength lest i feel compelled to sell them you could argue that the clubs strength is an insistence that we not be bound to faux dogma about these stocks the circes wont stop strap yourself to the mast for tomorrows round of unsustainable i will once again ask myself why the club is anomalous why do so many people have to be driven from the market because of concentration if it can be justified by invention and flows of funds isnt it enough to say the sheer mental acuity is enough to justify superiority and superiority means a bigger piece of a growing pie even if some of the multiples have gotten out of whack versus revenues so once again temptation to take profits will be there and once again that temptation justified by the fictional thesis of a market collapsing under the weight of the megacaps or a samsonlike etf must be resisted or ask yourself hasnt the complaint been front and center for many years has it ever been right with that the defense of the status quo rests let the prosecution begin anew perhaps with some sort of new theory or perhaps with no theory at all save this cant

boarded up windows left beach towns under evacuation orders and prepared for the powerful storm that has already cut a deadly path through parts of mexico and the carribean although beryl remained a tropical storm sunday as it churned toward texas it threatened to potentially regain hurricane strength in the warm waters of the gulf of mexico before making landfall early monday the storm was projected to come ashore in the middle of the texas coast around matagorda bay an area about 100 miles 161 kilometers south of houston but officials cautioned the path could still change texas officials warned the storm would cause power outages and flooding but also expressed worry that not enough coastal residents and beach vacationers in beryl’s path were heeding warnings to leave “one of the things that kind of trigger our concern a little bit we’ve looked at all of the roads leaving the coast and the maps are still green” said texas lt gov dan patrick who is serving as the state’s acting governor while gov greg abbott is travelling overseas “so we don’t see many people leaving” along the texas coast many residents and business owners took the typical storm precautions but also expressed uncertainty about the storm’s intensity in port lavaca jimmy may fastened plywood over the windows of his electrical supply company and said he wasn’t concerned about the possible storm surge he recalled that his business had escaped flooding in a previous hurricane that brought a 20foot 6meter storm surge “in town you know if you’re in the lowlying areas obviously you need to get out of there” he said farther down the coast in freeport mark richardson a 64yearold retiree said homeowners were busy “trying to tie everything down” and worried that beryl had people unsure about where along the texas coast it would make landfall he spent sunday morning on the beach and said ocean swells were quickly rising “the ocean is getting very angry very fast” he said the earliest storm to develop into a category 5 hurricane in the atlantic beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the caribbean on its way to texas the storm ripped off doors windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the atlantic’s record warmth three times in its one week of life beryl has gained 35 mph 56 kph in wind speed in 24 hours or less the official weather service definition of rapid intensification beryl’s explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm shows the literal hot water of the atlantic and caribbean and what the atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season experts said texas officials warned people along the entire coastline to prepare for possible flooding heavy rain and wind the hurricane warning extended from baffin bay south of corpus christi to sargent south of houston beryl lurked as another potential heavy rain event for houston where storms in recent months have knocked out power across the nation’s fourthlargest city and flooded neighborhoods a flash flood watch was in effect for a wide swath of the texas coast where forecasters expected beryl to dump as much as 10 inches 25 centimeters of rain in some areas potential storm surges between 4 and 7 feet 122 and 213 meters above ground level were forecast around matagorda the warnings extended to the same coastal areas where hurricane harvey came ashore in 2017 as a category 4 hurricane far more powerful than beryl’s expected intensity by the time the storm reaches landfall those looking to catch a flight out of the area could find that option all but impossible as beryl closed in hundreds of flights from houston’s two major commercial airports had been delayed by midafternoon sunday and dozens more canceled according to flightaware data in corpus christi officials asked visitors to cut their trips short and return home early if possible residents were advised to secure homes by boarding up windows if necessary and

to flooding local officials also banned beach camping and urged tourists traveling on the fourth of july holiday weekend to move recreational vehicles from coastal parks beryl earlier this week

had been widely expected to win the most seats — is seen coming in third after president emmanuel macron’s centrist alliance while money managers have spent the last week or so fretting over a le pendominated government the left’s success will likely still concern markets given it amounts to a fresh dose of uncertainty in the euroarea’s secondlargest economy and because the cohort is committed to a broad easing of fiscal policy that would exacerbate fears over france’s alreadybloated balance sheet and put the nation on a collision course with the european union which is already taking action to curb the budget deficit “french politics confounds yet again” said geoffrey yu senior strategist at bank of new york mellon “based on the results risks of expansionary fiscal policy remain and perhaps on the margins have picked up” while the left alliance is unlikely to win an absolute majority — potentially limiting how much it can do — the result could roil french assets in the coming days french markets plunged into a tailspin in june wiping out billions of euros from stocks and bonds as macron’s snap poll prompted concern that the farright would take power but over the past week traders pared a chunk of those losses as opinion polls indicated that the national rally would fall short of an outright majority france’s cac 40 index last week erased about half of the losses it endured in the aftermath of macron’s announcement the picture painted by initial projections sunday night is very different macron’s centrist party — favored by investors — is on track for second place despite a poor showing in the first round of voting the outcome could leave the president in a position to cobble together a centrist coalition still the inevitable political wrangling and anxiety about the influence of the left within a hung parliament could push up the yield on the nation’s 10year debt — known as oats — pushing the spread over safer german bunds wider once again that spread had eased to close at 66 basis points on friday after rocketing to more than 80 basis points last month — levels last seen during the euroarea’s sovereign debt crisis the “shocking result” could easily send the spread back above 80 basis points according to james rossiter head of global macro strategy at td securities “rates markets went into the elections with the oat vs bund spread pricing in a scenario for a hung parliament — but a hung parliament led by rn not nfp” he wrote in a note french bond futures start trading again at 210 am in paris followed by cash bonds at 8 am and stocks at 9 am an absolute majority for the left was identified by investors as the scenario they were most concerned about in the days ahead of the first round of votes but that possibility was discounted after le pen’s national rally convincingly won the first round among its pledges the left coalition wants to reverse seven years of probusiness reform and hike the minimum wage to implement its policies the leftist new popular front would require nearly €95 billion 102 billion in extra funds per year six times the spending planned by macron and his allies and almost double that proposed by the national rally think tank institut montaigne said before the vote france is already grappling with a budget deficit that at 55 far exceeds the 3 of economic output allowed under european union rules the international monetary fund predicts that — without further measures — debt would rise to 112 of economic output in 2024 and increase by about 15 percentage points a year over the mediumterm sp global ratings downgraded france in late may highlighting the french government’s missed goals in plans to restrain the budget deficit after huge spending during the covid pandemic and energy crisis vincent juvyns global market strategist at jp morgan asset management said tensions were likely with reforms spearheaded by macron now in doubt potentially hurting the value of french bonds versus their peers “markets may demand a higher spread as long as the new government hasn’t clarified its fiscal position” he said “the european commission and rating agencies are expecting 20 to 30 billions of cuts but the government will actually have to deal with a party which want to increase spending by 120 billion”,,,,,,,,Very Old

election,Fortune,https://fortune.com/2024/07/07/french-election-left-wing-coalition-shock-victory-macron-centrists-le-pens-far-right/,a coalition of the french left that quickly banded together to beat a surging far right in legislative elections won the most seats in parliament but not a majority according to polling projections sunday a stunning outcome that threatens to plunge the country into political and economic turmoil the projections put president emmanuel macron’s centrist alliance in second no longer in control of parliament and the bruised far right in third with no bloc securing a clear majority france faces uncertainty that could rattle markets and its economy the european union’s secondlargest and cast a shadow of political instability over the paris olympics opening in less than three weeks final results are not expected until late sunday or early monday in the highly volatile snap election that redrew the political map of france even before votes were cast galvanizing parties on the left to put differences aside and join together when macron announced just four weeks ago that he was dissolving parliament and calling the election in a huge gamble that the president hoped would shore up his centrist alliance it does not appear to have paid off for the deeply unpopular president projections forecast that his alliance would no longer be the largest single group in parliament possibly by a long way the national rally party of marine le pen greatly increased the number of seats it holds but fell far short of its hopes of securing an absolute majority that would have given france its first farright government since world war ii in paris’ stalingrad square supporters on the left cheered and applauded as projections showing the alliance ahead flashed up on a giant screen cries of joy also rang out in republique plaza in eastern paris with people spontaneously hugging strangers and several minutes of nonstop applause after the projections landed jordan bardella le pen’s 28yearold protégé who’d been hoping to become prime minister rued that the outcome of the vote “throws france into the arms of the extreme left” the most prominent of the leftist coalition’s leaders jeanluc mélenchon urged macron to invite the new popular front coalition to form a government the alliance he said “is ready to govern” the projections if confirmed by official counts will spell intense uncertainty for a pillar of the european union with no clarity about who might become prime minister — and the prospect that macron will be forced to govern alongside someone opposed to most of his domestic policies the results will influence the war in ukraine global diplomacy and europe’s economic stability the polling projections are based on the actual vote count in select constituencies french prime minister gabriel attal said he would resign but also that he would remain on an interim basis during the olympics or for as long as needed given that there could be weeks of negotiations to choose a new premier in a statement from his office macron indicated that he wouldn’t be rushed into inviting a potential prime minister to form a government it said he was watching as results come in and would wait for the new national assembly to take shape before taking “the necessary decisions” all while respecting “the sovereign choice of the french” a hung parliament with no single bloc coming close to getting the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority in the national assembly the more powerful of france’s two legislative chambers would be unknown territory for modern france unlike other countries in europe that are more accustomed to coalition governments france doesn’t have a tradition of lawmakers from rival political camps coming together to form a majority macron stunned france and many in his own government by dissolving parliament after the far right surged in french voting for the european elections in june macron argued that sending voters back to the ballot boxes would provide france with “clarification” the president was hoping that with france’s fate in their hands voters might shift from the far right and left and return to mainstream parties closer to the center — where macron found much of the support that won him the presidency in 2017 and again in 2022 that he hoped would fortify his presidency for his remaining three years in office but rather than rally behind him millions of voters seized on his surprise decision as an opportunity to vent their anger in last weekend’s first round of balloting voters backed candidates from the national rally in even greater numbers than in voting for the european parliament the coalition of parties on the left took second and his centrist alliance was a distant third the sharp polarization of french politics – especially in this torrid and quick campaign – is sure to complicate any coalitionbuilding effort racism and antisemitism marred the electoral campaign along with russian disinformation campaigns and more than 50 candidates reported being physically attacked — highly unusual for france the government said it deployed 30000 police for sunday’s runoff vote – an indication of both the high stakes and concerns that a farright victory or even no clear win for any bloc could trigger protests any cobbledtogether majority risks being fragile vulnerable to noconfidence votes that could cause it to fall prolonged instability could increase suggestions from his opponents that macron should cut short his second and last term the french constitution prevents him from dissolving parliament again in the next 12 months barring that as a route to possibly give france greater clarity,,,,,,,,Very Old

stealing tens of billions of dollars from americans every year a crime wave projected to get worse as the us population ages and technology like ai makes it easier than ever to perpetrate fraud and get away with it internet and telephone scams have grown “exponentially” overwhelming police and prosecutors who catch and convict relatively few of the perpetrators said kathy stokes director of fraud prevention at aarp’s fraud watch network victims rarely get their money back including older people who have lost life savings to romance scams grandparent scams technical support fraud and other common grifts “we are at a crisis level in fraud in society” stokes said “so many people have joined the fray because it is pretty easy to be a criminal they don’t have to follow any rules and you can make a lot of money and then there’s very little chance that you’re going to get caught” a recent case from ohio in which an 81yearold man was targeted by a scammer and allegedly responded with violence illustrates the law enforcement challenge police say the man fatally shot an uber driver after wrongly assuming she was in on a plot to extract 12000 in supposed bond money for a relative the driver fell victim to the same scammer dispatched to the home midway between dayton and columbus to pick up a package for delivery according to authorities homeowner william brock was charged with murder in the fatal march 25 shooting of loletha hall but the scammer who threatened brock over the phone and set the tragic chain of events in motion remains on the loose more than three months later brock pleaded not guilty saying he was in fear for his life advantage scammers online and telephone rackets have become so commonplace that law enforcement agencies and adult protective services don’t have the resources to keep up “it’s a little bit like drinking from a fire hose” said brady finta a former fbi agent who supervised elder fraud investigations “there’s just so much of it logistically and reasonably it’s almost impossible to overcome right now” grifts also can be difficult to investigate particularly ones that originate overseas with stolen funds quickly converted into hardtotrack cryptocurrency or siphoned into foreign bank accounts some police departments don’t take financial scams as seriously as other crime and victims wind up discouraged and demoralized according to paul greenwood who spent 22 years prosecuting elder financial abuse cases in san diego “there’s a lot of law enforcement who think that because a victim sends money voluntarily through gift cards or through wire transfers or for buying crypto that they’re actually engaging in a consensual transaction” said greenwood who travels the country teaching police how to spot fraud “and that is a big mistake because it’s not it’s not consensual they’ve been defrauded” federal prosecutors typically don’t get involved unless the fraud reaches a certain dollar amount greenwood said the us justice department says it does not impose a blanket monetary threshold for federal prosecution of elder financial abuse but it confirmed that some of the 93 us attorneys’ offices nationwide may set their own thresholds giving priority to cases in which there are more victims or greater financial impact federal prosecutors file hundreds of elder fraud and abuse cases annually the federal trade commission says the “vast majority” of frauds go unreported often victims are reluctant to come forward a 74yearold woman recently charged with robbing a credit union north of cincinnati was the victim of an online scam according to her family authorities say they believe the woman was preyed on by a scammer yet there is no record she made a formal police report “these people are very good at what they do and they’re very good at deceiving people and prying money out of them” said fairview township ohio police sgt brandon mccroskey who investigated the robbery “i’ve seen people almost want to fist fight the police and bank tellers because they … believe in their mind that they need to get this money out” a devastating scheme older people hold more wealth as a group and present a ripe target for scammers the impact can be devastating since many of these victims are past their working years and don’t have much time to recoup losses elder fraud complaints to the fbi’s internet crime complaint center rose by 14 last year with losses increasing by 11 to 34 billion according to a recent fbi report other estimates put the annual loss much higher a 2023 aarp study calculated that americans over 60 lose 283 billion each year to fraud the federal trade commission seeking to account for unreported losses estimated fraudsters stole a staggering 137 billion in 2022 including 48 billion from older adults the authors of that study acknowledged a “considerable degree of uncertainty” in san diego 80yearold william bortz said criminals stole his family’s nest egg of almost 700000 in an elaborate scheme involving a nonexistent amazon order a fake “refund processing center” in hong kong doctored bank statements and an instruction that bortz needed to “synchronize bank accounts” in order to get his money back bortz’s scammer was relentless and persuasive harassing him with dozens of phone calls and at one point taking control of his computer even though he was the victim of a crime bortz struggles with selfblame “i understand now why so much elder abuse fraud is never reported because when you look back at it you think ‘how could i have been so stupid’” said bortz who retired after a career in banking financial services and real estate his daughter ave williams said local police and the fbi were diligent in trying to track down the overseas scammer and recover the money but ran into multiple dead ends the family blames bortz’s bank which williams said ignored multiple red flags and facilitated several large wire transfers by her father over the course of eight days the bank denied wrongdoing and the family’s lawsuit against it was dismissed “the scammers are getting better” williams said ”we need our law enforcement to be given the tools they need and we need our banks to get better because they are the first line of defense” the justice department contends industry needs to do more saying the us can’t prosecute its way out the problem “private industry — including the tech retail banking fintech and telecommunications sectors — must make it harder for fraudsters to defraud victims and harder to launder victim proceeds” the agency said in a statement to the associated press a way forward banking industry officials told a senate subcommittee in may they are investing heavily in new technologies to stop fraud “and some hold great promise” the american bankers association says it’s working on a program to coordinate realtime communication among banks to better flag suspicious activity and reduce the flow of stolen funds but industry officials said the banks cannot singlehandedly prevent fraud they said the us needs an overarching national strategy to combat scammers calling the federal government’s current efforts disjointed and uncoordinated law enforcement agencies and industry need to join forces to fight fraud more quickly and efficiently said finta the former fbi agent who launched a nonprofit called the national elder fraud coordination center to cultivate better cooperation between law enforcement and major corporations like walmart amazon and google “there’s very very smart people and there’s very powerful wealthy companies that want this to stop” he said “so we do have the ability i think to make a greater impact and to help out our brothers and sisters in law enforcement that are struggling with this

from the influx a measure that would ban cruise ships with 250 or more passengers from docking in juneau on saturdays qualified for the oct 1 municipal ballot setting the stage for a debate about how much tourism is too much in a city that is experiencing firsthand the impacts of climate change the measure would also ban ships on july 4 a day when locals flock to a downtown parade the “shipfree saturdays” initiative that qualified this week will go to voters unless the local assembly enacts a similar measure by aug 15 which is seen as unlikely juneau accessible only by water or air is home to the mendenhall glacier a major draw for the cruise passengers who arrive on multistory ships towering over parts of the modest downtown skyline many residents of this city of about 32000 have concerns about increased traffic congested trails and the frequent buzz of sightseeing helicopters transporting visitors to the mendenhall and other glaciers deborah craig who has lived in juneau for decades supports shipfree saturdays craig who lives across the channel from where the ships dock often hears their earlymorning fog horns and broadcast announcements made to passengers that are audible across the water the current “overwhelming” number of visitors diminishes what residents love so much about juneau she said “it’s about preserving the lifestyle that keeps us in juneau which is about clean air clean water pristine environment and easy access to trails easy access to water sports and nature” she said of the initiative “there’s this perception that some people are not welcoming of tourists and that’s not the case at all” craig said “it’s about volume it’s about too much — too many in a short period of time overwhelming a small community” the current cruise season

was intact he stepped on toes as he collected taxes but built kra as a friendly outfit with the slogan kulipa ushuru ni kujitegemea if anyone dropped the baton later it was not waweru’s fault tax collection as he would remark came with discipline it was also about integrity of the people who manned the institution shielded by president mwai kibaki – who never called to protect tax dodgers – waweru had found a way to answer back politicians who tested his resolve untaxed goods as he found out eldoret international airport had become the platform for importers bringing in untaxed goods he had to close it down to the chagrin of importers first he ordered that all consolidated cargo should bear the names of individual imports their personal identification number and addresses but rather than abide by the rules some of the importers went to see deputy pm uhuru kenyatta who was also the minister for finance they had hoped he would help them as waweru later recounted in his book the tax czar “uhuru called me and said “can you come to my office i want us to sort out this matter about eldoret airport” but he answered without even thinking “dpm i am sorry i will not come” uhuru was taken aback by waweru’s response “why” he asked “because if i come from now on all tax matters will be resolved in your office and it is not healthy for you” what waweru did not say was that he wanted to run the show without politicians the other call came from eldoret north mp william ruto who had met the same traders rather than call ruto went with them to kra when he was told that some of the seized cargo had chemicals for making addictive drugs “he became restless and looked uncomfortable he glanced at his watch several times and then abruptly stood up and said ‘i was going for another meeting please proceed without me’” cigarettemaking company another person who tried to push waweru was thenprime minister raila odinga who had asked him to lift an agency notice against a friend running a cigarettemaking company waweru told him “prime minister you don’t have the power to do that” and raila said “i am the coordinator of government how come i don’t have the power” waweru’s responded “even my minister does not tell me to collect taxes from one person and not another” after witnessing president moi’s struggles with the international monetary fund waweru’s mission was to protect the ailing kibaki from similar financial pressures his close associates including then head of civil service francis muthaura protected him by doing the donkeywork and letting integrity drive the individuals those who misused that freedom ended up in the murky waters of the angloleasing scandal waweru’s commitment bore fruit when david mwiraria as finance minister presented a budget devoid of donor dependency – a groundbreaking achievement “i felt really nice we would pick and choose our friends” he said exceeding revenue targets five times in his nineyear tenure waweru helped the kibaki government achieve fiscal independence waweru was handson every day at precisely 4pm he would convene a meeting in the boardroom this daily revenue update was a ritual sh635 billion by the time he left the revenue had soared from sh180 billion in 2002 to sh635 billion in 2011 underpinning ambitious national projects he had never dreamt of playing such a role as a taxman when it was thrust to him by president kibaki he decided to take the challenge after 24 years the moi regime had run down the economy and tax collection was almost dead the landscape was fertile with tax dodgers and conmen kra was the playground of politicos as he took over from john munge he was shown a red line to state house “if that rings” he was told “it is from state house” but the phone never rang – and he never tried to test it until one day when he told businessman eddy njoroge who had been appointed by kibaki to revamp kengen about the phone “let us see if it works” njoroge had jokingly said to their surprise it was dead it meant that kibaki had no direct line to the taxman waweru had known kibaki for years while working with pannel bellhouse and mwangi audit firm kibaki was one of his clients between 1982 and 1986 as an accountant he had known most of the kibaki men at muthaiga golf club waweru’s journey began in the rift valley where his father worked for colonial settler john harris his early years were marked by the chaos of the state of emergency fleeing with his mother waweru was left to navigate a disrupted childhood as his father was detained when his father finally returned in 1956 waweru did not recognise the “stranger” before him waweru etched his name into history as the inaugural graduate from his nguka village in mwea it is this trajectory of firsts that eventually led to his appointment as the kra boss this role described by his associates as the true test of his capabilities was laden with responsibility failure would have risked waweru’s reputation and kibaki’s legacy formidable company initially waweru who had left ernst and young audit firm had decided to enroll for a masters degree and later a phd that changed when he met mr solomon karanja who enlisted him in the secretariat of kibaki campaign here he worked with the likes of eddy njoroge nat kangethe joe wanjui and others to craft kibaki’s manifesto after kibaki’s victory waweru thought he was done with his duties then the call came and it was prof nick wanjohi on the line wanjohi’s query was “who do you think is going to deliver on the manifesto you have been working on” this drew waweru back into public service the rise of transcentury as a formidable company became the best illustration on building capital the creation of transcentury by kibaki’s allies exemplified the era’s shift towards leveraging positions for entrepreneurial ventures just as heri limited symbolised kenyattaera investments transcentury became the nexus for kibaki’s associates to build a formidable business empire they bought east african cables and made billions they tried their hand at kenya railways and burnt their fingers,,,,,,,,Very Old

Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/07/jonathan-reynolds-business-secretary-sunday-politics-shows,the grownups are back in westminster the tory psychodramas inside no 10 have been replaced by a serious labour government focused on delivery it’s going to take time for all of us to make the adjustment except time is the one thing keir starmer is not going to allow his new cabinet he knows that the only way to win over those who didn’t vote for him last thursday is to make an immediate difference these days even a landslide majority is no guarantee of a second term even so jonathan reynolds the new business and trade secretary would probably have liked more than 40 or so hours to get his feet under the desk before being sent out on to the sunday morning politics shows i mean he probably hasn’t even worked out where the nearest toilet is in his department yet but there is no rest for the winners and trevor phillips and laura kuenssberg seemed genuinely bewildered that he didn’t have clear answers to every problem britain faces what the hell had reynolds been doing on saturday clearly masterminding a penalty shootout win in the euros was not enough how quickly we take a new government for granted after a half hearted “how does it feel to be called secretary of state” – no need to answer jonny – phillips cut to the chase tony blair had written a 1500word agony aunt column for the sunday times giving starmer advice in which he had said labour must deal with immigration almost as if the former prime minister was a bit narked that someone had got a majority to match his own bitter moi perish the thought tone had suggested introducing electronic id cards at which you began to suspect that he had a financial interest in the ai needed for their development he’s never been averse to making himself rich so what was the new government’s plan reynolds tried to take it all in his stride new government new candour it was almost as if cabinet ministers had been instructed to try to answer the questions nothing blair could say would ever be unhelpful he said though he could have been a lot more helpful it was like this the prime minister would be looking very hard at both legal and illegal migration through the prism of the jobs market which sounded much more sensible than anything we had heard in the last few years though he became rather more vague about id cards it was early in the morning and no one had told him what the government line on this was an hour or so later he would categorically rule out id cards in a radio interview no one could say the new government didn’t get things done quickly we moved on to brexit and freedom of movement just don’t call it freedom of movement there would be a renegotiation of some of the barriers to trade just all done on a nod and a wink whatever it takes watch this space over on the bbc kuenssberg wanted to know how he was going to sort out the ongoing dispute at the steelworks in port talbot quickly said reynolds without giving much away though not quickly enough for laura she sounded as if she was already disappointed in the new government then to the election itself how could labour say it had a mandate when it had only won about 35 of the vote both phillips and kuenssberg said this as if it was somehow labour’s fault rather than a consequence of the firstpastthepost system as if starmer was personally at fault for having adopted a strategy of trying to win as many seats as possible still it would have been fun if reynolds had said “you know what you’re quite right no one should be in government for the next five years on the basis of last thursday’s results what the country had voted for was for no 10 to remain empty for the next five years with nobody doing anything at all let the uk burn” instead he quite reasonably observed that people had wanted the tories out and that voters who had backed reform knew they were likely to get a

for the conservatives for providing us with this comedy duo the idea of a prolonged tory leadership campaign will be the gift that keeps on giving – to me at any rate – over the coming months maybe it will go on for years the idea of the tories uniting behind anyone is a category error vicky and honest bob were adamant they hadn’t agreed to appear on the show because they planned to stand for leader absolutely not that had been the last thing on their minds they would never have dreamed of coming on if that had been the case no the reason they were on was because they wanted to be able to look voters in the eye and say “thank you for not choosing us last thursday we always wanted to be humiliated because we had betrayed your trust so from the bottom of our hearts we are grateful for what you have done” which was weird because only last week i could have sworn both had been insisting that the tories were the only party who could be guaranteed to deliver on their promises “i’m here to show the country that i understand” said atkins vote for me vote for me “we need to focus on our values” just as soon as they’ve discovered what those values are assuming they still have any honest bob was hilarious someone should give him his own sitcom seldom has someone more obviously useless rated himself so highly “in politics you lose as a team” he said just marvellous from the man who had resigned from rishi sunak’s government at the turn of the year for it not being sufficiently rightwing the only team he has ever been on is his own and that of the pornographer dirty des when there’s planning permission to be granted over on sky phillips was lamenting that no tory mp would come on his show clearly atkins and honest bob had suddenly taken their lack of leadership ambitions very seriously trevor had to make do with nadhim zahawi neither he nor phillips could work out why he was on the neverending existential crisis for most extory ministers so they both sat down to fill out

A0507,2024-07-07,309,Antero Midstream: Solid Business But There Are Better Picks Out There (NYSE:AM),Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702808-antero-midstream-stock-solid-business-but-better-picks-are-out-there?source=feed_all_articles,art wager antero midstream nysenyseam is a midstream energy operator with a market cap of just over 7 billion am portfolio assets are comprised of gathering pipelines compression facilities interests in processing and fractionation plants and water handling systems am is also active in establishing joint ventures to grow enter into larger projects without assuming full risk here the most notable jv of am is formed together with mplx lp nysemplx where the underlying operations are around developing and operating large scale processing and fractionation assets if we look at the historical fiveyear total return performance and compare it with the overall midstream segment we will clearly see how consistently am has generated alpha over the relevant index in the chart below it is evident that really starting from early 2020 am has assumed a strong and upwardsloping return trajectory ycharts such a notable gap in the registered returns could raise a question on whether ams valuations have gone too far from the underlying value in fact relatively recently ubs cut its rating on am from buy to hold referring to the fact that the risk and reward profile has reached an equilibrium moreover the current dividend yield offered by am is not that enticing compared to what we can find in the midstream space currently am yields only 61 which is circa 120 basis points below the yield of alerian mlp etf nysearcaamlp index lets now assess the underlying fundamentals of am to determine whether it makes sense to go long here thesis at its core am is a rather similar business to its peers such as enterprise products partners nyseepd enbridge enb energy transfer nyseet mplx etc the business model is built on durable natural gas infrastructure assets which enjoy almost a permanent demand profile with the only exceptions in the cash generation stemming from potential operational failures other than that am is able to generate consistent and periodically growing cash flows that are backed by sound contracts the only aspects that materially distinguish am from its peers are the following two 100 of ams cash generation is underpinned by fixedfee contracts thus mitigating the commodity risk factor as opposed to most of its peers am is almost fully focused on natural gas segment which is inherently more favorable from the valuations perspective ie introduces a greater predictability in the business moreover as for most of midstream companies the recent financial performance for am has been very strong for example q1 2024 was a record quarter for am with the organic growth landing at a 4 and 6 in gathering and processing volumes respectively compared to last year in terms of the ebitda generation am registered a doubledigit ebitda growth while achieving a doubledigit declines in the capex spend as a result of these dynamics am landed record free cash flow levels of 182 million and 74 million if we adjust for the dividend payments here the chart below captures nicely how am has been sticking to a free cash flow focused strategy since q3 2022 when it started to consistently register surplus results after accounting for dividend distributions antero midstream investor presentation part of this is obviously driven by the previous capex programs coming online and ams success in organic growth but one of the key reasons is clearly the reduced capex spend antero midstream investor presentation what we can notice in this capex related chart is that am remains rather committed on decreasing the organic capex even further which should per definition leave more liquidity at ams books to either derisk the balance sheet or conduct buybacks the commentary in the recent earnings call by brendan krueger cfo of antero midstream offered an interesting color in this regard yes thanks for the question this is brendan i think as weve talked about on past calls as well i mean we look at everything in terms of return and on overall capital so as we approach this 3x leverage target as we mentioned second half of this year well look to it will be positioned us well to buy back shares or pay down further debt or execute for the bolton acquisitions weve got the 500 million program out there as you mentioned and we do see attractiveness in our shares still today so as we sit here today share buybacks would continue to make a lot of sense but well certainly evaluate that as we as we hit that 3x target hopefully in the second half of this year apart from the organic capex spend there is also an ma component that might temporarily drive the surplus cash generation levels of am lower for instance may this year am announced that it has ventured into a bolton acquisition of assets in marcellus shale at a ticket size of 70 million while this might introduce some challenge for am to keep derisking the balance sheet and or enjoy growing surplus cash flow levels we have to keep in mind that fundamentally the ma transactions are accretive and in ams case typically of a small scale even looking at the comment above by brendan krueger we can see that the management remains committed on bringing the net debt to ebitda at 3x speaking of the balance sheet currently am carries a net debt to ebitda of 31x which is not the lowest level in the sector but still an indicative of a sound capital structure on top of this am has no debt maturities in 2024 and 2025 and the one which comes due in 2026 is related to the credit revolver the bottom line all in all antero midstream business is strong and underpinned by sound financials both from the cash generation and capital structure perspective the fact that all of the contracts are based on fixedfee and that the operations are almost fully based in natural gas segments should warrant some premium while the balance sheet is not the strongest in the sector the distant debt maturity profile in combination with a focus on deleveraging render am interesting also from this angle however with all of this being said i am still hesitant to go long am the reason is simple in general i agree with ubss view that the upside potential is largely exhausted the recent runup in the share price has pushed the valuations higher accordingly evebitda of 12x which is on the high end in midstream space making the dividend yield of 6 relatively unattractive for me there are better midstream alternatives out there where the dividend yields are higher balance sheets stronger and growth prospects rather similar to what antero midstream has outlined below are just three examples where i have issued buy thesis,,,,,,,,Very

the pce have confirmed solid economic growth of 2 which amounts to a pretty comfortable soft landing while markets may be wringing their hands over a slowdown from the fed’s perspective it would be most welcome chief global economist seth carpenter said in fact a slowdown at least as big as we expect is probably seen as necessary within the fed to achieve its goal of extending the current cycle while bringing inflation down after a lull in the 1990s economy and a very shallow reversal from the fed the economy continued to grow for the rest of the decade currently the market is pricing in cuts and we actually expect a bit more than is priced but like the 1990s we think the cutting cycle will be shallow investors hoping for a “late cycle” scenario that turns to a rebound where rates are slashed by several hundred basis points may be in for some disappointment in the news this weekend casino operators on the las vegas strip have a nearterm earnings catalyst on the horizon with the closing of the tropicana las vegas and the mirage hotel casino representing a 49 combined reduction in total room supply on the las vegas strip the ap notes that when the tropicana opened in 1957 it was the most expensive and lavish casino on the strip nicknamed the “tiffany of the strip” it cost 15 million to build with 300 rooms split into two wings creating a footprint shaped like the letter “y” behind the scenes it had ties to mobster frank costello and has been a pop culture staple it served as the location of moe greens hotel in “the godfather” and in “diamonds are forever” james bond says “i hear that the hotel tropicanas quite comfortable” cbre equity research analysts said the mirage is the more meaningful contraction we estimate that the mirage had 1mm occupied room nights and generated 596m of revenue and 169m of ebitdar in fy23 this represents significant underlying demand for the las vegas strip that will need to find a home looking to the markets stocks are coming off their best week since april with heavyweight nvidia nvda snapping a twoweek losing streak seeking alphas rena sherbill spoke to jonah lupton who runs the fundamental growth investor investing group i dont even know what to make of nvidia i mean i dont think we know what the next three four five years is going to look like for artificial intelligence we dont know their specific roadmap we dont know what competitors might be coming down the pipeline with their own chips i mean weve all heard stories about the hyperscalers like google goog googl microsoft msft theyre going to want to build their own chips okay it sounds good i dont know if theyll actually be able to do it and then how will those chips compare to whatever the newest greatest nvidia chip is and if theyre building their own chips are they going to save enough money by using an inferior chip to justify not using the best nvidia chip like i dont know i mean china bytedance bdnce is apparently trying to develop their own chips now i just its wild i just dont think i think if you believe in artificial intelligence i just think this is the one stock that you have to own and you cant try to trade in and out of it because its going to do things like this down 6 one day up 8 the next day thank god i started buying it a year ago when it gapped up on that earnings report even though i didnt fully understand the importance of h100s and where that would lead us but now i mean you listen to these earnings calls from all the hyperscalers and all they talk about is trying to get their hands on as many h100s as possible or h200s and the new bgs that are coming out i mean tesla tsla is getting ready to build a supercomputer with dell dell and super micro with tens of thousands of h100s like its like an arms race which company can buy the most h100s and then i dont even know whats going to happen in two or three years lets just say meta meta has 10000 h100s at what point do they have to upgrade and then what do they do with the h100 do they sell them off for 050 on the 1 or do they keep them and go buy whatever the new chip is i dont know its going to be very interesting to play out i just think if you believe in artificial intelligence and llms and i just think nvidia is still the best way to play it and in the wall street research corner wells fargo says the boom in ai sets up companies focused on natural gas as trend winners midstream energy companies focused on natural gas should be visible longterm beneficiaries from the build out of datacenter capacity in the us to run ai operations analyst ian mikkelsen said about 43 of electricity is generated from natural gas and the buildout of energyhungry data centers is in very early stages “we believe that us natural gas production capacity and reserves are sufficient to meet growing demand with infrastructure being the key constraint in balancing supply with this demand growth over time” he said “we expect this to provide midstream companies with incremental growth opportunities and higher utilization of existing assets ultimately extending the terminal value of natural gas infrastructure”,,,,,,,,Very Old

spy broke strongly to new alltime highs this was expected due to the positive momentum from q2 and a higher timeframe bullish bias and my article from two weeks ago suggested to hold your nose and buy this weeks article looks at expectations for h2 and why it may not be such a good idea to buy now as we are above 5550 various techniques will be applied to multiple timeframes in a topdown process which also considers the major market drivers the aim is to provide an actionable guide with directional bias important levels and expectations for future price action sp 500 monthly and quarterly the sp500 has closed out its third stellar quarter in a row furthermore 2024 has had the second best start to election year in history with only 1976 having a larger return through the first half of the year a positive start to an election year has been an extremely positive omen for spx out of the 16 previous years where it has had a positive return in the first half of the year prices have been higher 100 of the time in the second half including 5 years that had doubledigit returns for h2 the table below is from our research at matrixtrade h2 returns matrixtrade of course a lot can happen in the space of 6 months the table below shows we can still expect an average drawdown of 725 in these typically bullish periods h2 drawdowns matrixtrade technical analysis can help identify when this drawdown will unfold and find opportunities to buy the dip a look at the monthly chart shows new highs for july which is expected given the bullish june bar and positive q2 the first half of july is also the best performing twoweek period of the year amazingly the nasdaq has been higher in july 16 times in a row spx monthly tradingview but just like h2 or q3 a lot can happen in a month a 5 rally can lead to a top reversal and then close the month 05 it would still be marked down as a positive month now that new highs have been made the july bar should really stay above the 5446 monthly low to stay bullish later in the month the june high of 5523 could be important but it is too close to current trading to be relevant now fibonacci extensions and measured moves provide targets the next major level comes from the 1618 expansion of the 20212022 bear market and is way up at 5638 support comes in at the july low of 5446 and the 5265 area july is bar 8 of a possible 9 in an upside demark exhaustion count these counts can have an effect from bar 8 onwards so a reaction could be seen this month sp 500 weekly a very strong bar formed this week negating the bearish implications of the previous weekly doji bar the close at the highs and above the channel suggest the move will follow through early next week the weekly demark exhaustion signal has now completed and this is a red flag especially combined with the monthly exhaustion now in play looking back at previous 3 signals we can see a reaction either on bar 9 or 2 weeks following the completion of bar 9 that is a pretty big window and certainly no reason to short but the warning is clear the last two corrections of 5 happened soon after weekly exhaustion signals spx weekly tradingview resistance at the weekly channel highs has been broken but as mentioned in previous articles this was minor and the rally could simply hug the channel as it moves higher this weeks low of 5446 is initial support 5265 is a major level but should not be tested if this rally is to stay strong sp 500 daily 3 bullish daily bars propelled the spx to 5570 and fridays close at 5567 was right at the highs suggesting follow through at some point the french election at the weekend may cause european stocks to dip and pull down sp500 futures into a lower open but as long as the gap down is not significant eg over 1 it should recover directly for new highs indeed a favorable result in france may cause a large gap higher the volume profile at the right of the daily chart shows a balanced profile centered on the heavy volume level of 5470 moving too far over 5570 would pull this out of balance and is likely unsustainable without building a new high volume area at higher prices 5470 could act as a magnet on the next dip spx daily tradingview resistance comes from the weekly and monthly references on the downside 544046 is initial support but the big level remains 5400 the 20dma is at 5452 and rising so could be in play on the next dip an upside demark will be on bar 8 on monday a reaction is expected on bars 8 or 9 so new highs could lead to exhaustion and a pausedip driversevents the odds for a september cut have been rising and now sit at around 72 fed chair powell helped this process by stating we “are getting back on a disinflationary path” at the ecb’s sintra forum on tuesday weak data such as ism services pmi falling from 538 to 488 and an adp payrolls miss aided the dovish expectations but it was fridays jobs report which pushed the odds over 70 youve got to wonder how bullish this really is a september cut has always been likely as long as inflation moderates and we dont really need to see the economic data unravelling as well after all history tells us cuts wont be the magic solution for a slowing economy next week has three major scheduled events on tuesday and wednesday fed chair powell will make his semiannual monetary policy report before the senate banking committee is there anything new to say perhaps there is in light of last weeks data although it would be a major shock if he hints at a july cut in 25 days the odds of this are very low at only 78 so the fed would have to be very concerned to surprise the markets this way i therefore wonder if a july cut would be a sell the news event as it would reflect a fed panicked by the economy thursdays cpi reading is expected to come in at 01 taking the yoy figure to 31 this would be another step towards easing fridays release of ppi may only ignite shortterm moves but is still an important metric probable moves next weeks the stats and the charts are all bullish h2 is very likely to close higher as is july however this is quite a vague expectation and there is scope for all sorts of moves before the monthly and h2 closes while dips at certain levels may be a buying opportunity i would no longer to suggest to hold your nose and buy near the current price of 5567 its too distant from support and inflection points furthermore exhaustion signals are mounting up in multiple timeframes and the rally is being driven by weak data encouraging dovish positioning there is a shortterm bias for further highs next week based on fridays strong close but i actually expect new highs to reverse on monday or tuesday and snap back to at least the high volume area of 5470 as always inflection points can be used to assess whether the next dip is healthy or a change in trend unfortunately these cannot be moved higher so 544046 remains initial support and 5400 stays as a key inflection holding these levels should lead to yet another new high but a weekly close below 5400 could open the door for a move to 5000 later in q3 this would ultimately create a buying opportunity to seek a positive close for h2,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0512,2024-07-07,309,"Jack In The Box: Appetizing Price, Adaptability To 'Value War' (NASDAQ:JACK)",Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702804-jack-in-the-box-stock-appetizing-price-adaptability-value-war?source=feed_all_articles,lindajoheilman introduction in my last analysis we talked a little about companies that are adopting a defensive strategy to navigate a slow traffic scenario endogenous and exogenous pressures require the definition of a strategy and it seems that among qsrs adapting to the time preferences of lowincome guests is the most natural strategy after all there is direct competition with convenience stores in this context i invite you to take a deep dive into the strategies and recent developments of jack in the box nasdaqjack one of the big names in qsr with the peculiarity of having a large part of its units located in california the epicenter of ab 1228 before we begin our analysis i would like to talk a little more about the current situation before getting into the actual developments first no one is immune to the downturn and like almost the entire industry in the first quarter jack reported a sharp decrease in samestoresales both in its own stores 06 and in franchises 26 del taco which is another concept owned by jack reported a decrease in sss of 14 systemwide basically with the drop in traffic restaurants that had a positive sss in the quarter needed to compensate for this factor with an increase in the average check in jacks case the company even managed to increase the average check by 31 but this was not enough to compensate for the 37 drop in traffic although we do not see major changes in operating costs for the jack in the box concept with labor costs representing 306 of all quarterly revenue within the restaurants operated by the company the company is going through a period of refranchising aiming to contain operational costs in the del taco concept for example labor costs grew by 14 reaching 349 of all revenue generated remember the 303030 rule this is generally the minimum acceptable standard when dealing with operating costs in restaurants probably aware of this the company made some changes to the units management models in 2023 the company refranchised 5 jack in the box units and 16 del taco units this year even before the end of the first semester the company refranchised 13 del taco units this movement will probably have consequences in relation to the volume of revenue generated by the company but it is an important movement that aims to contain costs in order to sustain growth without using an absurd amount of capital until last year del taco was made up of 46 owned units and 54 franchised at the moment the concept has approximately 28 of its own units and 72 of franchised units this movement should continue until the composition becomes similar to that of jack in the box which in 2024 has 7 of its own units and 93 of franchises now that ive introduced the companys current situation lets navigate topic by topic and understand how jack is positioning itself within the industry some generalities about the qsr situation in california and rising labor costs how does this impact traffic and margins with a large portion of its units located in california i consider it important that we dedicate a section to understanding how the impacts of ab 1228 are affecting qsrs within the current dynamics of the restaurant industry first take a look at the numbers the state of california is jacks main market accommodating 949 units this represents about 43 of all its units ahead of texas with 584 units and representing 27 of total units and arizona with 178 units and representing 8 of total units when we look at the populationrestaurant ratio we have very attractive numbers even with the large concentration of units in two states there are 41945 people per restaurant in california 49651 in texas and 40893 in arizona in los angeles alone jack has 42 units six more than in san diego given this high concentration of units it is clear that setting the minimum wage at 20 per hour only in qsrs would have significant impacts for jack but before we look inside i invite you to look outside how does the minimum wage policy affect the segment at the end of the day as the famous french author frédéric bastiat says we must not end our investigation on what is seen but we must seek to know what is not seen yes the first basic observation what you see would be the decrease in traffic and the increase in labor costs these labor costs need to be passed on if the company wants to keep its margins intact but if guests are becoming increasingly price sensitive and there is a whole host of substitute products threatening the financial integrity of restaurant operations that cost will be passed along with the bitter price of decreased traffic lets talk about decreasing traffic first according to a very interesting survey by placerai fastfood chains within the state of california had weaker traffic than the national average in 10 of the 12 weeks after the law was enacted this is clearly a sum of three interconnected factors the first factor is due to substitute products convenience stores bakeries and markets are taking a share of the restaurant market precisely because they present cheaper and sometimes just as appetizing options according to porter substitute products have a very interesting task in the dynamics of industries and competitive strategy they reduce the potential returns of an industry and so we saw this happening in practice precisely with the lowincome guest but all the guests seem to be giving in little by little research by technomic presents us with some impressive results regarding this fact the number of people who visit restaurants at least once a week fell from 68 to 67 when we looked at lowincome guests we also saw a drop from 59 to 58 on the other hand when we look at convenience stores the scenario is very different the percentage of customers who go to convenience stores increased from 57 to 59 and when we look at lowincome consumers this number increased from 55 to 58 the second factor is also clear as a sunny day labor costs needed to be passed on for the sake of earnings integrity im not saying that the price increase started only when we saw an increase in labor costs but well before that as i said in my rbi analysis many fastfood chains have raised prices at two and even three times inflation in the last ten years this was the case with mcdonalds mcd with a 100 increase in prices since 2014 and popeyes increasing by 86 other chains like wendys wen and burger king qsr were a little more restrained and rose 55 an important observation is that inflation in the same period was 31 the third factor and this is interesting because it represents a dynamic within california that differs from the rest of the country is that the decline in qsr traffic is being pressured by the underlying increase in traffic at fullservice restaurants also from the perspective of placerais research we can note that traffic was positive in eight of the last twelve weeks surpassing quick service restaurants in all periods analyzed this indicates that there is a transfer of occasional guests who prioritize value and experience within the benefits they expect at the time of the meal something that is much more present and malleable within fullservice restaurants by their very nature everything in the end comes down to the value perceived by the guest this is interesting because the national average of traffic at fullservice restaurants has been quite different in the rest of the country in the last two months than within california as shown in the following graph placerai in finance we generally measure the costbenefit of certain projects by relating the present value of cash flows to the initial cost whereas in marketing everything is more subjective the costbenefit index for consumers has to do with the relationship between expected benefits and perceived value if guests have the opportunity to enjoy a fullservice meal with all the underlying benefits that such a restaurant offers for a price just a little higher than a qsr the answer becomes obvious and explains this phenomenon caused by the increase in the minimum wage within california and the situation we see today putting this discussion once again under porterian terms we have a substantial competitive advantage in favor of fullservice restaurants within the state if youve read my previous reviews you know that this dynamic between limitedservice restaurants and fullservice restaurants only occurs within california we have plenty of examples to confirm this companies like bjs bjri chuys chuy first watch fwrg olive garden and the entire portfolio of darden dri concepts except longhorn dine brands din and many other service restaurant chains complete showed a decline in traffic speaking specifically about jack now we know that the company is committed to offering an attractive value offer recognizing the need to adjust pricebased promotions to navigate this scenario at the end of the day qsrs are closer to competing with convenience stores than the broader value proposition offered by fullservice restaurants so when it comes to limitedservice restaurants there is almost an overwhelming need to bring back the lowincome guests and thats what jack seems to admit we will talk about promotions later within this context we saw the companys sss drop 25 systemwide mainly driven by the decrease in traffic this number worsens when we consider franchises which had a sss reduction of approximately 26 meanwhile companyowned restaurants had a 06 lower sss now talking about labor costs and how this impacted margins this last quarter we have the following overview total revenue own restaurants and franchises and operating costs author unlike most restaurants in the last quarter jack was able to proportionally reduce labor expenses as its revenue from its own restaurants decreased that is through the franchise model the company is reducing labor costs proportionally in the quarter jack reduced labor costs by 164 and the same panorama was seen in the other operational cost centers now when we relate revenue from own operations to labor expenses we obtain a proportion of 32 in the second quarter of 2023 which increased by less than 05 in a simpler way we can say that jack is leveraging its franchise model to absorb the rise in labor costs reducing the pressure on its financial resources to summarize this dynamic we can infer that despite the increased pressure on labor costs jack is optimizing the management of this cost center and increasing the performance of its franchise model even when this reduces revenue from its own operations managing to transfer part of these costs and preserving the integrity of its operations regarding slow traffic with the imminent price increase to contain costs it is expected that this trend will continue to repeat itself as long as macroeconomic pressures remain tight and lowincome guests are kept away by substitute products and full service restaurants the latter specifically within california in this scenario it is important that we take a look at the mix of promotions and other developments that serve as an attraction for lowincome guests and that is what we will discuss in the following section how does jack fit into an environment focused on financial efficiency and pricebased promotions to start lets take a look at jacks mix of promotions we know that management is committed to the return of traffic and lowincome guests which is essential for the operation of the qsr and the maintenance of traffic after all this is a volumeoriented segment with few opportunities to add value through its dynamic streamlined nature and a pricesensitive guest at the end of may jack launched its munchies under 4 promotion this promotion consists of a menu of selected items with great appeal for less than 4 the promotion includes jr jumbo jack tiny tacos french toast sticks and the new sourdough grilled cheese among other options the new promotion is clearly targeted at lowincome guests in the same vein as other fastfood chains weve seen recently this is a strategy that aims to influence the balance of forces within the qsr segment presenting a strategy that aims to combat the actual causes of traffic reduction if you are paying attention to the industry you will remember that almost all of jacks direct competitors also established segmented promotions for the most pricesensitive guest burger king launched and promised to maintain the eat like a king promotion until the end of the year which consists of choosing a sandwich option from three available chicken jr whopper jr or bacon cheeseburger fries nuggets and drinks all for 5 popeyes which is also an rbi brand has reintroduced its big box with two pieces of fried chicken a choice of side and a lentil biscuit for 699 wendys with breakfast for 3 and the biggie bag offering a similar offer to burger king but with upscaling options ranging from 4 to 6 mcdonalds also launched a mcchicken or mcdouble promotion with nuggets fries and a drink for 5 in june lasting an estimated month despite some claims from franchisees that were circumvented through a deal with coca cola ko there are many examples we could spend a good amount of time talking about them but the most important fact is that jack is acting reactively to market movements and this demonstrates that the company is committed to bringing lowincome guests back to restaurants the efficiency of using the park is also being considered by the company wendys for example has been relying on its offpremises sales in the mornings which have proven to be an interesting weapon for generating alternative sources of revenue in historically slower periods we also have some developments of this type at jack first in the morning the company made toast sticks a permanent item on the menu and believes that this inclusion will gradually strengthen the park in the morning on a consistent basis during the evening management also believes they have a chance to gain market share mainly by reintroducing chickntater melt and marketing efforts the most interesting thing here is that jack is not living off promotions alone we talked a little about barbell menu strategy and how this is especially important in the current scenario in early 2024 the company launched the smashed jack burger made with seasoned beef topped with grilled onions thick pickles and a new sauce called boss sauce served on a buttery brioche bun the pricing is more attractive to premium guests and serves as an interesting lever to increase the average check it turns out that after a very strong launch the supplier halted production forcing jack to halt sales until the supply chain stabilized in march after its return the smashed jack burger helped catapult the average check by 2 which is curious to say the least i believe that jck got the pricing right for smashed as it is at a threshold where lowincome guests can still try it while still guaranteeing a significant cash inflow when compared to promotions and often the cash inflow is as significant as substantial margins new pos new possibilities in the digital field i see jack still a little behind its direct competitors around 13 of all its sales are in the digital environment rbi for example increased its sales in digital channels from 13 billion in 2022 to 14 billion in 2023 an increase of almost 8 across all its brands burger king us alone showed 40 growth in the digital channel which represents around 27 of all total sales at popeyes approximately 25 of all sales are made through digital channels at yum brands yum we saw a 25 increase in digital sales over the same period with taco bell achieving an impressive 31 increase in digital sales wendys slightly above jack in this sense reached the mark of 145 of its total sales through digital channels as you can see there is no shortage of examples in the digital field another very interesting development is the integration of the new pos called qu if you read my review of dine brands and how the integration of data collected by tray pos is being used to generate ihop inapp purchasing suggestions and how this is helping to increase the average check per guest i highly recommend strongly reading these are ways in which restaurants can adopt data management and artificial intelligence to generate extra sales and this is the future for the industry there is no way around it but what are the benefits of this new pos for jack and how will the reach of digital sales enhance the guest experience first of all the new pos will aid in operational efficiency in routine tasks such as integration of payment methods order management kitchen management staff management for peak hours effective implementation of selfservice kiosks menu management and of stocks note that in the long term after the complete integration of the restaurants with the new pos more accurate management of these processes will help jack to expand its margins and achieve stronger results it is interesting how almost all players are developing process management solutions that involve integrating the pos with some ai system that assists daily processes we can give some examples of this bjs restaurants bjri is a chain of casual dining restaurants that is standing out by improving its profit margin by adopting processes that benefit its operational efficiency especially after pw partners adapted the companys cost structure integrating your pos with the ai ​​tool allows you to identify the busiest days in advance so managers at the unit level can make decisions that increase the efficiency of operations another interesting example is the case of starbucks sbux with queue management problems in recent times mainly due to the complexity of preparing customizable drinks and logistics with ice the company developed the siren craft system this system is basically an update of the same one the company used in 2022 and consists of three distinct fronts the first relates to the adoption of new preparation routines the second is the creation of the peak play caller employee figure who can change roles according to traffic needs and the third is the integration of aibased predictive tools with the pos to detect critical moments for the formation of very long queues and increased waiting times when we talk about pos integrations with ai for suggestions for online sales platforms like ihop we still dont have a concrete forecast but the most important fact for jack is that this is now achievable remodeling and lean units a point of convergence as i have always said in my analyses the development of lean units is more than desirable it is necessary with a very mature industry and profitability being sucked up by substitute products and high entry barriers related to economies of scale industry managers are increasingly valuing expansion projects through units with a higher costbenefit ratio and a lower payback in fact in my last text in which i wrote about first watch one of my points of criticism was precisely the underutilization of assets and the lack of projects aimed at lean units despite developing some very interesting renovations in the kitchen and dont think that even within the theme of lean units there is no differentiation quite the opposite bloomin blmn for example underwent a broad project in 2023 to remodel and close outback units that were not performing satisfactorily which became known as the 2023 closing project where 10 of its own units were closed in the united states all of which were units of old models on the other hand in 2021 bloomin developed a type of unit called joey which is 4800 to 5000 square feet approximately 16 joey units were opened in brazil in 2023 dine brands in contrast to smaller units with greater reach to lower volume markets developed the dualbranded unit which interconnects an ihop unit with an applebees unit contiguously without internal partitions note that this model optimizes the park at different times for the two concepts as each one has its own peculiarities regarding peak traffic hours however its implementation is not lean quite the contrary opening costs are even bigger once again there are many examples for jack we have the craved model the plan is for the company to achieve a net growth of 2 per year in relation to the number of units with all new openings using the same prototype which is already being used in mexico where jack opened its first unit in the second quarter and is already attracting the attention of operators according to the ceo the craved model has an estimated payback of less than five years and is already being implemented in 88 restaurants that are at some point in their development phase to have some basis for comparison in relation to the estimated payback of the craved model which is 5 years or less lets take a look at some projects that i have been following portillos ptlo a fastcasual chain recently released some data about its units of the future developed to spearhead its accelerated expansion project the company currently has paybacks of 8 years for units in the midwest 7 years for units in the sunbelt and 4 years for a unit in chicagoland after the introduction of lean units scheduled for 2025 paybacks would decrease to 6 5 and 3 years respectively a fiveyear payback is what most restaurants want when developing lean units this generally means a decrease of two to three years in the payback of an average volume project along the same lines and with an average payback of five years there are also the new units of potbelly pbpb and walkons sports bistreaux therefore i see the craved units as a good sign that the company is acting proactively within the new industry requirements this is a sign that there is the possibility of expansion in the medium term perhaps internationally some considerations about financing and investments before formulating my thesis for jack i would like to establish some comparisons about the companys profitability to do this i would like to examine some metrics that will help us discover how jack behaves in relation to some direct competitors lets do this quickly so we dont go on too long author at first glance we can notice a decrease in the rate of return using operating cash flow that is in simplified terms the company is generating a lower cash return in the last twelve months than before but how did this happen if net profit did not show anomalous variations during this period simple the ocf for the last twelve months was directly impacted by an accumulation of operating accounts more precisely due to receivables for the first time in two years jack presented a negative operating cash flow and this occurred at the end of last year accumulating 1075 million in operating assets that needed to be covered through investment in current assets and consequently reduced the ocf in the last quarter jack still had its ocf reduced by just over 3 million for the same reason however despite keeping the ocf reduced due to this clutter in the operating accounts jack still managed to maintain a record investment of 988 million in capex and maintain a positive free cash flow note that despite these problems jack managed to maintain its free cash flow on invested capital at levels similar to wendys if we normalized its free cash flow to nonanomalous levels we would have a free cash flow of approximately 6 which is not bad at all also note the difference between roa and roce this is precisely due to the comparison method and the exclusion of interest paid on thirdparty capital and taxes on the latter in conjunction with the high burden of implicit costs on thirdparty capital jack also has many sources of operational financing in current liabilities which reduces the need for financial liabilities to fund immobilization and also reduces the capital employed to give you an idea when we exclude the effects of interest and taxes jack shows an ebit margin of 1514 which is more than 90 higher than the industry median this brings us to the need to take a look at jacks financing structure author note that even by industry standards jack finds itself with very high levels of debt despite the reduction in leverage since 2019 where the company reached a debt ratio of 176 the company only reduced just under 5 of its longterm debt over the course of two years which still continues to put pressure on its operating profit remember despite this the company does not incur shortterm debt to maintain its investments in operational assets but uses operational liabilities mainly those not related to the cash conversion cycle but which help the company to not have to incur addictive shortterm loans in any case depending on shortterm loans or not i consider jacks debt levels to be quite high despite not incurring a massive economic risk due to the satisfactory generation of ebit the company incurs massive financial risk due to leverage still on debt i would also like to make some brief considerations about the imminence of financial risk and the possibility of economic risk based on coverage data firstly i was able to identify a deterioration in the debt efficiency index return on debtcost of debt the index in 2017 was 56 falling to 27 during the pandemic and maintaining a range between 28 and 40 until then both the return on debt and the debt efficiency are at levels below their 10year average other indicators that i modeled were related to debt coverage from cash flow as you already know jacks cash flow has been suffering for some time due to an increase in operational accounts mainly at the end of 2023 and beginning of 2024 we have already talked about this but what we havent talked about yet is how this affects debt coverage with cash flow stagnant and debt rising at least until 2019 we noticed a deterioration in principal coverage using ocf over the last ten years jack maintained an average principal coverage ratio with an ocf of 771 this meant that jack generally needed a little more than 7x its ocf for the corresponding year to cover its debt principal jack currently maintains an index of 149 for those interested in more heterodox data debt interest coverage from the ocf through the debt service coverage indicator adjusted for cash flow variability also deteriorated falling from 279 in 2019 to 194 to have a basis for comparison the average coverage of indebted companies like bloomin brands is 809 in the case of debt efficiency despite seeing a drop in prepandemic standards jack still outperforms direct competitors such as wendys which has maintained an index of 217 in the last five years while jack has an index of 314 in the same period therefore we can say that even though it is very indebted and needs to restructure its financing sources jack is still able to maintain solvency rates in line with companies despite being very indebted that are less indebted than itself my thesis in my opinion jack has everything a limitedservice restaurant needs to navigate an environment that suffers exogenous pressures due to substitute products and increases in labor costs and endogenous pressures promotional environments and industrylevel margin compression this implies that the company is actively positioning itself so that its capabilities integrate new industry paradigms promotions with appeal use of barbell pricing in menu engineering premium items with a satisfactory gross cash inflow successful launches see the case of smashed jack burger and all the buzz on social media make me see that both prices and the products are aligned with industry paradigms broader strategies such as the integration of a modern pos that allows the use of all the benefits provided by ai are also almost mandatory today although in this sense jack is not at the same level as its peers the recent integration with qu seems to me that there will be developments in this regard therefore the coming quarters should see an increase in digital sales as the company completes this integration other needs that i also see as mandatory are the optimization of the park at times with lower traffic and the development of lean units being developed within jack the craved unit appears to have a very satisfactory payback and will be able to lead the international expansion project in this sense i see the success of the units in mexico and the interest of new operators as something very interesting and should also be observed closely another very interesting point is the refranchising of companyowned units this is helping and will likely continue to help jack deal with rising labor costs in the long term furthermore the aspects that concern me at the moment refer to the structural aspects of the company we saw a dilapidation in solvency ratios corroborated by a weaker operating cash flow and a persistently large longterm debt that appears to be out of step with the ebit which continues to grow slowly typical of mature companies however jack maintains a negative net need for working capital managing to finance its working capital from operational liabilities this implies that even with the increase in operating assets that we have recently seen cluttering up the cash flow jack does not appear to have a need to increase financing and increase its total debts in my opinion these structural factors are resolved when we compare them with other indebted companies as i have done previously and look at their undervaluation therefore even with these headwinds i still see potential in jack within the current environment as the company is adapting to the vast majority of needs that a modern qsr must seek at current price levels i would recommend buy for jack i believe that all the problems we discussed previously have already been priced in the company is taking extensive measures both to maintain margins and to attract lost traffic by presenting a very interesting promotional mix valuation i would like to start our valuation procedure today not with the comps but with the npvgo model to accomplish this we need to calculate both the value of your current operations and the value of future growth opportunities we consider eps for fiscal 2024 to be in line with analyst estimates of 632 for the discount rate i used 797 the payout rate for jack is approximately 29 naturally the retention rate will be 71 thus the retention per share is 449 which will generate growth from retention of just 028 in the first year of retention 029 in the second and 031 in the third as the retentionbased investment serves as the initial cost of investment projects each year we have a negative npv all these years which when we bring it to present value with the help of the discount rate we have the following values ​​for the next three years 089 086 and 083 but you may even wonder why do managers choose projects with negative npvs wouldnt it be easier to distribute a higher percentage of the profit the issue is not that simple stephen ross a leading professor of corporate finance conjectures that managers like to control large companies and retain profits rather than pay dividends and thus increase the size of the firm anyway when we calculate the perpetual value of npvgo it is 2731 we need to add this to the value of the firm as if it were a cash cow using the eps to calculate the simple perpetual value which is 7930 this means the enterprise value npvgo is 5199 this is approximately 53 above the current share price lets see how this happens in the comps model i selected five companies to compare with jack the result is in the following table author note that to arrive at the value of 8928 i excluded from the average both pricesales and evsales which were inflating our target price using the comps model remembering that i used both equity ratios and enterprise ratios the latter being multiples that consider the capital structure note that even considering the capital structure both evebit and evebitda present prices higher than the current value of the share now we can look at the discounted cash flow models first lets start with dividends we already know that because the payout is low less than 30 the expected dividend d1 will be lower and consequently our target price will be lower to resolve this fact i will use the single period ddm and the multi period ddm this way we will avoid considerations regarding the growth of these dividends the result is what you see in the table below author now lets model the dcf for wacc we will consider 673 the following image is the fcff forecast for the coming years author note that the dcf model also indicates that the share is being traded below its intrinsic value more or less in line with the value we found in npvgo however in this case the price based on the dcf points to an upside of approximately 65 we can still use the graham model and the lynch model to obtain some other perspectives that corroborate the undervaluation hypothesis for growth in the graham model i used the internal growth rate which we use in the npvgo model for the lynch model i used the estimated eps growth rate for the next fiscal year remembering that as the lynch model does not indicate a target price but rather a state of relative valuation it will not be included in our football field graph and consequently in the analysts definitive target price author now that we have a series of results from different valuation models lets combine this data to find a target price that takes into account all the assumptions we made football field target price author conclusion i would like to conclude by saying that although i believe in jacks resilience in the current environment some factors would make me consider lowering my rating for the company the first of these is performance basically aggressive adaptation strategies require more timely results to be justified this is even more true when taking into account that qsrs compete directly with convenience stores which puts them in a more dangerous place in terms of pricing than casual dining for example another factor that i consider extremely important is the level of debt i will be monitoring the solvency ratios and as soon as they exceed the standards of highly indebted companies like wendys or bloomin i will give my opinion on the matter for now i dont see any great danger just precaution,,,,,,,,Very Old

A0524,2024-07-07,309,Could Nvidia Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-nvidia-stock-help-become-160600689.html,nvidia nasdaq nvda has reached record highs over the last year as it has become the poster child for a boom in the artificial intelligence ai market since the start of 2023 the chipmakers stock has skyrocketed 174 while quarterly revenue and operating income have climbed 93 and 149 wall street has rallied behind nvidia as it has achieved a majority market share in ai graphics processing units gpus just as demand for the chips has soared uncertainty about how long nvidia can keep up its bull run weighed on its stock toward the end of june and the start of july when it fell as low as 118 per share after hitting a high of 135 per share just days before however its share price rebounded on july 3 rising 4 as the slump proved temporary meanwhile the company still has plenty to be bullish about nvidia has years of dominance in the chip market under its belt suggesting its role in ai is unlikely to dissipate any time soon the chipmaker also has new product launches in the works that will likely continue to boost sales and earnings to retain its lead in the retail chip market heres why nvidia stock could help you become a millionaire over the long term nvidia has a long history of success in the chip market nvidia initially made a name for itself by carving out a dominating role in video games the company was one of the first to begin selling chips to the consumer market with gamers using its gpus to build highpowered gaming pcs nvidias success in the industry has seen its desktop gpu market share rise from 65 in 2014 to 88 in the first quarter of 2024 a lead in gaming chips perfectly positioned the company to gain a dominant role in datacenter gpus and eventually ai in fact according to iot analytics nvidia is responsible for more than 90 of the datacenter gpu market many of these data centers have become crucial to the development of the ai market powering platforms like amazon web services microsofts azure and openais chatgpt nvidia has managed to retain its dominance in gpus in different sectors across tech despite the persistence of companies like advanced micro devices and intel for instance while nvidia has added more than 20 points to its desktop gpu market share over the last decade amds has actually fallen from 33 to 12 meanwhile intel briefly had a 4 share in q1 2023 which has since dwindled to 0 the best is yet to come were only about a year into the recent boom in ai suggesting developers have barely scratched the surface of whats possible with the generative technology as the market progresses chip demand is only likely to continue rising meanwhile nvidia is leveraging its lead to steer the industry in its favor and challenge its competitors story continues in 2024 nvidia transitioned to a yearly release schedule for new chips when a twoyear cycle was previously the market standard the shift forced amd and intel to follow suit as a result nvidia is gearing up to launch its blackwell line chips the companys next generation of ai training processors ceo jensen huang noted at the announcement the blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history a leading reason for nvidias success is the software platform accompanying its ai chips which it calls its compute unified device architecture cuda developers worldwide have grown accustomed to this ecosystem with switching akin to how a user of apples iphone might feel about switching to a samsung phone consequently nvidias competitors will likely face an uphill battle trying to gain traction in ai nvda operating income quarterly chart moreover the data in the table above shows the significant financial lead nvidia has achieved over its competitors since last july nvidias operating income and free cash flow have skyrocketed far higher than amd or intels indicating nvidia is far more capable of continuing to invest in its business and retain its market dominance despite recent growth nvidias priceearningstogrowth peg ratio sits at less than one indicating its stock remains a value alongside nearly unrivaled dominance in the budding ai market nivida is a screaming buy this july and a stock

first half of 2024 the sp 500 index is up 16 year to date and is sitting at new highs but there are still plenty of stocks that could head higher in the near term these three motley fool contributors see more upside for carnival nyse ccl roku nasdaq roku and amazon nasdaq amzn heres why they believe these top stocks are timely buys in july this travel stock is poised to hit new highs jennifer saibil carnival carnival is coming off a rebound year when it completely crushed the market gaining 130 you would think it would have to demonstrate some seriously strong performance to keep that up and so far so good the market seems to think its had enough and carnival stock is trading down 6 this year but as it continues to exceed expectations it shouldnt stay down for much longer management delivered an excellent update for the 2024 fiscal third quarter ended may 31 with many metrics hitting new highs including customer deposits and booking levels revenue hit a secondquarter record of 58 billion and operating income was five times last years levels it reported a positive net income of 92 million 500 million better than last year management raised its outlook across the board for the full year theres been concern that carnivals incredible rebound is a shortterm reaction to cruise closures but demand remains strong and customers are booking out into 2025 in a classic illustration of supply and demand carnival has been able to charge top prices due to high interest and low inventory for longer periods this is helping it move further out into higher profitability and wipe out more of its debt which remains high but its looking quite likely that it will be able to clear it over the next several years and return to a solid financial position management is taking a number of actions to improve the business not only from a financial standpoint its investing in the passenger experience with better connectivity and celebrity performances it has upgraded its planning software and is strategically streamlining its fleet to effectively use its resources these are the kinds of actions that should generate more demand increased sales and sustained profits with carnival stock still down year to date investors can get excited about a rebound in the back half of the year this oversold stock looks ready for a comeback jeremy bowman roku while the sp 500 continues to churn to alltime highs the streaming sector has lagged behind entertainment giants like walt disney and warner bros discovery are still trading down substantially from their previous highs and roku stock has fallen nearly 90 from its peak during the worst of the pandemic story continues the industry has undergone a brutal correction after a boom during the pandemic but there are signs that the correction could be coming to an end disney just reported its firstever profitable quarter in streaming and a pending merger between paramount global and skydance could also help alleviate some of the competitive pressure in the industry meanwhile digital advertising has begun to recover following a sharp drop during the pandemic all of those developments are good news for roku shares of the streaming distribution leader plunged as its path to profitability under generally accepted accounting principles gaap looked unclear and revenue growth slowed following a spike during the pandemic but the underlying metrics in the business remain strong streaming hours jumped 23 year over year in the first quarter to 308 billion and streaming households were up 14 to 816 million showing its still rapidly gaining new customers revenue also rose 19 year over year to 8815 million and it reported its third quarter in a row of adjusted profitability in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization roku has struggled as its media partners have pulled back on advertising spending due to the challenges in the industry but that should start to change as the streaming platforms take steps to profitability and new launches like the flagship espn streaming network which is due out next fall as roku grows its user base and revenue and the stock price remains down the buy case gets stronger as business conditions improve the bottom line and the stock price should respond in kind investors should stick with this winner john ballard amazon amazon stock has doubled the sp 500s 24 return over the last 12 months by rising 51 the stock just recently broke to another new high which could be a sign of things to come in the second half of 2024 the main story for amazon over the past year has been improving profitability the company is focused on widening its competitive moat in ecommerce by growing its selection of items while keeping costs down this has led to improved sales momentum in online retail stores but most importantly its cost reduction led its firstquarter operating income to triple over the yearago quarter to 15 billion its no surprise to see wall street analysts upbeat about amazon for example wells fargo sees it reporting betterthanexpected financial results in the next earnings report the bank bumped up its price target on the stock from 234 to 239 implying a 21 upside from the current share price of 197 the consensus wall street estimate projects amazons earnings per share to grow 23 per year over the next several years assuming

A0527,2024-07-07,309,45% of Warren Buffett's $398 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/45-warren-buffetts-398-billion-100000837.html,warren buffett led the berkshire hathaway nyse brkanyse brkb holding company since 1965 he likes to invest in companies with steady growth reliable profitability strong management teams and shareholderfriendly initiatives like dividend payments and stock buyback programs that strategy is working berkshire delivered a 4384748 return between 1965 and 2023 that translates to a compound annual gain of 198 which is nearly double the 102 annual return of the benchmark sp 500 index over the same period in dollar terms an investment of 1000 in berkshire hathaway stock in 1965 would have grown to over 43 million whereas the same investment in the sp 500 with dividends reinvested would be worth just 312333 buffett isnt the type of investor who chases the latest stock market trends so you wont find him piling into redhot artificial intelligence ai stocks today but three stocks berkshire already owns are set to benefit tremendously from ai and they account for more than 45 of the conglomerates entire 3987 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities image source getty images 1 snowflake 02 of berkshire hathaways portfolio snowflake nyse snow developed its data cloud to help businesses aggregate their critical data onto one platform where it can be analyzed more effectively to extract its maximum value the service was designed for use by large complex organizations that work with multiple cloud providers like microsoft azure and alphabets google cloud a situation that often leads to the creation of data silos then last year snowflake launched its cortex ai platform which allows businesses to combine readymade large language models llms with their own data to create generative ai applications cortex also comes with a suite of ai tools such as document ai which allows businesses to extract valuable data from unstructured sources like invoices or contracts and snowflakes copilot virtual assistant which can be prompted using natural language to provide valuable insights across the snowflake platform in the companys fiscal 2025 first quarter which ended april 30 snowflakes product revenue came in at 7896 million a 34 increase from the yearago period thats a robust growth rate at face value but it continued a trend of deceleration from prior quarters though snowflake continues to invest heavily in growth initiatives like marketing and research and development it is acquiring new customers at a slowing rate and its existing customers are expanding their spending with it more slowly story continues berkshire hathaway bought its stake in snowflake around the time of the data cloud specialists initial public offering in 2020 so it likely paid around 120 per share the stock soared to as high as 392 in 2021 but it has since declined by 63 from that level and now trades at 142 unfortunately due to the companys slowing growth the stock still appears to be quite expensive so this is one berkshire pick investors might want to avoid for now 2 amazon 05 of berkshire hathaways portfolio berkshire bought amazon nasdaq amzn stock in 2019 and buffett has often expressed regret that he didnt spot the opportunity sooner amazon was founded as an ecommerce company but it expanded into cloud computing streaming digital advertising and now ai its amazon web services aws cloud division designed its own data center chips which can be up to 50 cheaper for ai developers to use compared to its other infrastructure powered by nvidias chips plus the amazon bedrock platform offers developers a library of readymade llms from some of the industrys leading startups in addition to a family of llms called titan that amazon built inhouse in essence aws wants to become the goto destination for developers looking to create their own ai applications various wall street forecasts suggest ai will add anywhere from 7 trillion to 200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade potentially making it amazons largest opportunity ever berkshire hathaway owns a 2 billion stake in amazon representing just 05 of the conglomerates stock portfolio ai could drive substantial growth for the company over the long term so if buffett wished that position was larger before he might be kicking himself for not adding to it sooner after this next chapter unfolds 3 apple 445 of berkshire hathaways portfolio apple nasdaq aapl is berkshire hathaways largest position by far the conglomerate has spent around 38 billion accumulating shares starting in 2016 and its position is now worth 1776 billion even after it sold 13 of its stake for tax reasons earlier this year apple makes some of the worlds most popular devices including the iphone ipad apple watch airpods and the mac line of computers the company is entering the world of ai with its new apple intelligence software which will be released alongside the ios 18 operating system in september it was developed in partnership with openai and its set to transform the user experience for apples devices its siri voice assistant will lean on the capabilities of chatgpt as will its writing tools like notes mail and imessage to help users rapidly craft content there are more than 22 billion active apple devices worldwide meaning this company could soon become the largest distributor of ai to consumers the upcoming iphone 16 could drive a significant upgrade cycle because it is expected to come with a powerful new chip capable of processing ai workloads ondevice apple ticks all of buffetts boxes for a stock pick it has grown steadily since berkshire first invested in 2016 its consistently profitable it has a resolute leader in ceo tim cook and it returns truckloads of money to

A0528,2024-07-07,309,4 Reasons to Buy PepsiCo Stock Like There's No Tomorrow,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-buy-pepsico-stock-135800964.html,few companies are as proven and durable as food and beverage giant pepsico nasdaq pep the company has performed for decades showering investors with dividends and building wealth over generations the stock has steadily faded in recent weeks and is approaching 52week lows years of inflation have consumers grappling with higher grocery prices and sentiment is dropping investors have already seen companies like mcdonalds cite weaker consumer spending as a headwind to their business so should investors stay away or is now the time to buy the stock here are four reasons longterm investors should buy the stock like theres no tomorrow 1 bestinclass brands pepsicos worldclass food and beverage brands have been its pillar of strength creating decades of growth and wealth for its shareholders the stock price has appreciated more than 10000 over its lifetime and the dividend has grown over 5300 pepsicos brands include beverage headliners like pepsi mountain dew gatorade and lipton while its food products include names like doritos cheetos lays quaker and many more pep revenue ttm chart dominating the grocery aisle means that pepsico products get toptier shelf space in supermarkets and pricing power because consumers generally will buy what they know and love additionally food and beverage products are small ticket items pepsico can get away with bumping the price a few cents because it doesnt dramatically impact consumers budgets decades of population growth and price increases have steadily driven revenue to over 91 billion annually 2 still an excellent dividend grower pepsico is a dividend dynamo because it offers yield and growth investors buying today get a solid starting yield of 33 on top of that pepsico has raised its dividend by an average of 66 for the past five years its most recent 71 increase shows that management is confident in the companys outlook remember pepsico has raised its dividend for 52 consecutive years a dividend king so to maintain inflationbeating dividend growth after all this time is impressive notably the dividend is well secured by a payout ratio thats 66 of pepsicos estimated 2024 earnings profits are high enough that pepsico can comfortably afford the dividend and still invest in the business or repurchase shares this consistent growth outpacing inflation is how the stock has performed so well for so long 3 solid growth outlook what is most important for investors is whether pepsico can continue to grow at this pace after all this company which sells snacks and bottled beverages is now a 225 billion behemoth fortunately pepsicos growth formula still seemingly has mojo left story continues the beauty of pepsico is its many growth levers it chugs along as it raises prices sells more products to a growing global population and acquires and launches new product brands some of pepsicos recent hits include newer beverage brands such as bubly and starry it has also invested in the energy drink industry by acquiring rockstar in 2020 and entering into a major collaboration with celsius in 2022 management is currently guiding for 4 yearoveryear organic revenue growth in 2024 and a 7 increase in earnings per share over 2023 analysts looking further out expect more of the same consensus estimates call for earnings growth averaging over 7 annually for three to five years 4 stellar business at a fair price the market does silly things sometimes weaker consumer spending could put some pricing pressure on pepsico and the stock market is seemingly pricing that into the stock shares have now fallen over 17 from their high pepsico has averaged a pe ratio of almost 26 over the past decade and shares have now fallen below 20 times this years estimated earnings pep pe ratio chart does the stock deserve to be traded at a discount while pepsico might feel some pressure while consumers are struggling its hard to argue that the business is fundamentally worse especially when the outlook remains consistent with the companys past performance do you want to discount the stock thats already happened barring an unexpectedly bad collapse in the business pepsico stock seems like a fantastic business trading at a fair price today to apply buffetts advice investors shouldnt hesitate to buy a wonderful business like pepsico at a fair price should you invest 1000 in pepsico right now before you buy stock in pepsico consider this the motley fool stock advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and pepsico wasn’t one of them the

A0529,2024-07-07,309,2 Biotech Stocks With Big FDA Decisions Approaching – Here’s What Analysts Expect,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-biotech-stocks-big-fda-130151932.html,there are few sectors that can offer investors massive returns – but biotech comes to mind as one these companies are typically involved in the pharmaceutical or medical device industries and they are famous for their unique combination of high overhead and high product lead times and even higher profit potential when a new product makes it through the regulatory approval process so biotech stocks can definitely bring the rewards that investors want – but they are not investments for the riskaverse it can take years for new drugs or devices to reach the market the companies generally operate at a loss until then and there is no guarantee that products will be approved the key here as it is in all investing is to do the homework for biotechs that means finding companies with important catalysts coming up in the near term we’ve gotten a start on this process finding two biotech stocks that have important fda decisions on the near horizon according to the latest data from the tipranks database both stocks hold buy ratings from the street’s analysts – and both offer solid upside potential in the triple digits in one case let’s take a closer look ascendis pharma asnd ascendis the first stock we’ll look at is a company that is in the process of building a marketable drug program based on its unique technologydevelopment platform this platform is dubbed transcon a portmanteau shortening of transient conjugation using the platform a flexible technology that makes use of advanced chemistry ascendis can design drug candidates that work by linking the therapeutic agent to an inert carrier compound the platform is capable of designing new drugs with novel therapeutics and equally novel delivery mechanisms that can meet unmet needs in multiple diseases the company’s work is focused mainly on two conditions – growth hormone deficiency ghd in adults and children and hypoparathyroidism pth also in adults and children – and ascendis has a ghd medication approved and on the market already the ghd drug skytrofa received its original approval in 2021 and is currently generating revenues in both the us and europe the company plans to submit a supplemental biologics license application to the fda for use of the drug to treat ghd in adults during the current 3q24 its hypoparathyroidism drug candidate completed the clinical trial process last year but is currently facing delays in the approval process the initial new drug application for palopegteriparatide the transcondeveloped pth drug elicited a complete response letter from the fda in may of last year the updated nda was resubmitted in december and given a pdufa date – may 14 of this year on that day ascendis announced that the fda had extended the date by three months to august 14 that day is rapidly approaching and marks the next major catalyst for ascendis story continues in the meantime we can look back at the company’s last quarterly report which covered 1q24 in that report ascendis gave a top line of 959 million euros for a yearoveryear gain of 185 that total included 65 million euros in skytrofa revenue a figure that was up 106 yy the company ran a net loss in the quarter of 131 million euros or 230 euros per share this biotech firm has caught the eye of stifel analyst alex thompson who sees the transcon pth drug as the main factor to bring in investors he writes of ascendis “asnd’s transcon pth is the key focus of the stock… we remain confident in the prospects for approval in the us despite multiple delays… hypoparathyroidism represents a multibillion euro commercial opportunity on the backdrop of a growth hormone base business skytrofa that can continue to grow via broader transition of the daily market to weekly and label expansion – even in the presence of major competitive threats to that end we model peak sales for transcon pth in hypoparathyroidism of €30b based on conservative penetration assumptions and skytrofa sales of €13b above and inlinelower than consensus estimates respectively” these comments back up thompson’s buy rating on the stock and his price target set at 200 implies an upside of 47 on the oneyear horizon to watch thompson’s track record click here overall these shares have earned 11 recent analyst reviews including 9 buys and 2 holds for a strong buy consensus rating the stock is selling for 13581 and its 18338 average target price suggests that it will gain 35 over the coming year see asnd stock forecast citius pharmaceuticals ctxr next on our list is citius another biopharma company citius is devoted to the creation of new treatments for critical care conditions in both infectious disease and oncology the company has two drug candidates at late stages of the trial and regulatory processes these candidates include lymphir a new reformulation of denileukin diftitox and minolok an antibiotic lock solution designed to treat bloodstream infections related to catheter use both of these drugs have high potential in the oncology field lymphir is billed as an improvement on an existing drug for the treatment of cutaneous tcell lymphoma ctcl a form of nonhodgkin lymphoma usually localized on the skin and catheterrelated blood infections are serious – and frequently lifethreatening – secondary infections to which cancer patients are dangerously susceptible of these two pipeline candidates lymphir is the farthest along citius submitted the bla last year and in july received a complete response letter the company responded addressing the fda’s concerns and in march of this year received notice that the application had been accepted for review with a pdufa date of august 13 while that was going on citius was also proceeding with the latestage trials on minolok and in may of this year released positive data from the phase 3 trial of the antibiotic lock the data release showed that minolok has achieved both the primary and secondary endpoints in the trial maxim analyst michael okunewitch covers this stock and bases his upbeat take on the progress of lymphir through the fda regulatory process writing “we maintain a positive outlook on the bla filing recall that the original crl was based on manufacturing controls and product testing rather than safety and efficacy the company has taken steps to address these concerns…” okunewitch goes on to outline the potential of lymphir as a revenue generator adding of the drug candidate “one of the key considerations for assessing the value of lymphir is to look at the commercial opportunity within cutaneous tcell lymphoma ctcl there are an estimated 30k40k patients in the us living with ctcl and 3k new cases per year when ontak was originally on the market in the early 2000s it generated sales in the range of 30m40m per year however the market has changed significantly in the years since and we believe these changes to the treatment landscape have increased the potential market opportunity for lymphir – management estimates the opportunity as high as 400m” for the maxim analyst this adds up to a buy rating while his 4 price target indicates room for a huge oneyear upside of 666 to watch okunewitch’s track record click here there are only 2 recent analyst reviews here but they both agree that this is a stock to buy making the moderate buy consensus unanimous the stock is priced at 53 cents per share and its average target price of 4 matches the maxim view see ctxr stock forecast to find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations visit tipranks’ best stocks to buy a tool that

A0530,2024-07-07,309,Thinking About Sinking $100K Into Rental Properties? Consider This Passive Income Option Instead.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thinking-sinking-100k-rental-properties-090800349.html,buying a rental property offers the promise of passive income in theory the tenants will pay more than enough rent to cover the propertys expenses enabling the landlord to pocket the difference in passive income in addition to that income rental property owners can capture tax benefits and property price appreciation however rental properties have their drawbacks the upfront cost can be well over 100000 when factoring in the down payment closing costs and any repairs needed to make the property ready to rent meanwhile the income isnt always passive since you need to manage the property and the tenants on top of all that an unexpected vacancy or repair can turn a rental property from a money maker into a money pit there are many alternative ways to generate passive income from real estate an easy option is to invest in a real estate investment trust real estate investment trust reit these lowcost vehicles enable anyone to collect income backed by real estate here are two top reits to consider the lazy way to be a landlord many real estate investors start by owning residential rental properties they buy singlefamily homes or duplexes and rent them out to tenants while being a landlord can be profitable an easier way to generate passive income from rental housing is to invest in a residential reit there are many great ones including camden property trust nyse cpt the company owns 171 communities with over 58000 rental units in 15 major us markets it focuses on markets where jobs and the population are growing at aboveaverage rates that drives demand for housing keeping occupancy high and rental rates rising camdens rental property portfolio supplies it with steadily rising income to pay dividends the reit currently pays a quarterly dividend of 103 per share 412 annually with a share price recently around 110 camden has a dividend yield of around 38 at that rate every 1000 invested into camden would generate about 38 of annual passive income the reits dividend payments should steadily rise in the future driven by rent growth and the companys expanding portfolio camden has four new communities under development including its first two buildtorent singlefamily communities it has the land to build nine more communities giving it plenty of room to continue growing build to produce passive income one of the great things about reits is that they open the door to investing in many types of rental properties for example realty income nyse o owns a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate including retail industrial gaming and data center properties the reit owns 15540 singletenant properties across all 50 states the uk and six other european nations story continues those properties supply it with very stable rental income that it uses to pay dividends realty income pays a monthly dividend of 0263 per share 3156 annually with its share price recently around 53 it had a dividend yield of about 59 realty income has an exceptional record of increasing its dividend since going public in 1994 it has raised its payout 126 times including for the last 107 straight quarters the main factor driving that growth is a steady diet of acquisitions the reit routinely purchases properties from its operators in saleleaseback transactions it will also acquire other reits and fund development projects given that there are trillions of dollars of commercial real estate that it could acquire in the future in its core markets it has a long growth runway ahead easy ways to generate passive income from real estate buying a rental property can be a great way to collect passive income however this approach has drawbacks including a high upfront cost and the need to manage tenants and repairs reits provide passive income without those disadvantages making them ideal options for many beginners realty income and camden property are among the best making them great reits to buy if youre looking for passive income should you invest 1000 in realty income right now before you

first half of the year is fully behind us we can take its measure – and what we see illuminates both hopes and risks on the positive side the stock markets have posted strong firsthalf gains the sp 500 is up nearly 17 and the techheavy nasdaq has gained 24 on the negative side the gains are narrow and concentrated in the tech sector semiconductor maker nvidia up more than 150 so far this year alone accounts for approximately onethird of the sp gains the narrow base alone might not spook investors – it’s based on the latest ai technologies which are rapidly proving their worth in new products and services but it’s also an election year and as we all know anything can happen at the polls in november the recent debate between president joe biden and former president trump the presumptive challenger only served to muddy those waters further we can filter out some of those muddy waters with the right tool – such as the smart score from tipranks this aibased data collection and collation algorithm gathers and sorts the accumulated data of the stock market – and uses it to rate every stock according to a set of factors that have proven accurate forecasters of future performance the result is given as a simple score on a scale of 1 to 10 with the ‘perfect 10s’ being stocks that deserve a closer look so let’s give two topscoring stocks – ‘perfect 10s’ – just that close look that they deserve according to the tipranks database the street’s analysts recognize these shares as strong buys and are predicting plenty of upside for both here are the details janus international group jbi we’ll start with a constructionrelated company a firm focused on a product that most of us never even think about although we use it every day doors janus a design and manufacturing company provides solutions for doors and entryways to the commercial industrial and construction sectors the company works with builders and contractors offering a variety of doorway

hallway systems and a range of doors made from varying materials and with varying levels of weatherproofing and security protection janus typically deals with enterprise clients story continues janus is also noted for its nokē system a smart entry system designed to enhance doors and entryways in the selfstorage niche the nokē system provides benefits for both storage facility owners and customers including improved security automated lock checks and overlocking processes janus advertises this system as one of many it can offer to bring new technological innovations to its bestinclass selfstorage door systems in addition to its commitment to providing the best quality in topend doorway products janus is also committed to expanding its footprint in the business in late may the company announced that it had acquired terminal maintenance and construction or tmc a leading provider of terminal maintenance services in the trucking industry tmc operates primarily in the southeast us and its acquisition will provide support for the expansion of janus’ facilitate business division which provides a full range of facility maintenance services earlier in may janus beat expectations when it reported its financial results for 1q24 the company’s earnings release showed a top line of 2545 million while up only 1 from the prior year period this revenue total was 16 million better than had been anticipated at the bottom line janus’ nongaap eps of 21 cents per share was 2 cents above the estimates – and the total net income of 307 million was up more than 18 yearoveryear this stock has been covered by jefferies analyst philip ng who sees plenty of potential here for continued growth he notes that janus is executing well on its business and writes “despite a mixed backdrop for selfstorage reits jbi has seen continued momentum particularly in new construction and its backlogs have remained stable jbi is delivering solid growth strong margins and capital deployment provides good optionality with the stock trading at 70x 2025e evebitda we see a path for jbi to rerate higher now that its float has improved and it becomes discovered by a broader shareholder base” the fivestar analyst goes on to give these shares a buy rating with a 20 price target that indicates room for a 63 share appreciation on the oneyear horizon to watch ng’s track record click here while janus has only 3 recent analyst reviews they are unanimously positive – for a strong buy consensus rating from the street the stock is selling for 1225 and its 2050 average target price implies a oneyear gain of 67 see jbi stock forecast atmus filtration technologies atmu next on our list atmus is an industrial firm offering a portfolio of highquality differentiated filtration solutions on the

A0533,2024-07-07,309,Rivian Just Made a Game-Changing Move. Here's What You Need to Know,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-just-made-game-changing-130000179.html,rivian automotive nasdaq rivn has been a tough stock to own since its initial public offering ipo the electric vehicle ev maker went public at 78 per share on nov 10 2021 and set a record high of 17201 less than a week later but currently trades at about 15 rivian initially impressed investors because it was already producing thousands of vehicles and was backed by amazon and ford motor company unfortunately its stock crumbled as it missed it own production targets racked up steep losses and lost ford as a leading investor rising interest rates also popped its bubbly valuation image source rivian but on june 25 rivian announced a new joint venture jv with volkswagen otc vwapy to codevelop new ev technologies many bullish investors praised the partnership as a gamechanging move for rivian and its stock has soared more than 30 since its opening price that day lets see what this deal might mean for rivians future how rivian and volkswagen can help each other rivian and volkswagens joint venture will be equally owned and controlled by both companies it will use rivians zonal hardware design and integrated technology platform as a foundation to develop new softwaredefined vehicles sdvs for both companies rivian will license its intellectual property to the jv for now volkswagen will start using rivians existing electric architecture and software platform to build new evs but by the second half of the decade both companies plan to launch new vehicles created from the jvs codeveloped technologies a recent rumor also suggested rivian was in early talks with volkswagen to expand their software partnership into a manufacturing one but rivian refuted those claims volkswagen plans to invest up to 5 billion in rivian and the jv it already bought 1 billion of rivians notes which will be converted to its common shares on dec 1 and it plans to make two additional tranches of 1 billion investments in 2025 and 2026 it will also invest 1 billion in the jv upon its inception and provide it with a 1 billion loan in 2026 that big investment isnt too surprising given volkswagen remains an underdog in the ev market its sales of batterypowered evs rose nearly 35 to more than 771000 units in 2023 but that was only equivalent to 8 of the global ev market and less than half of teslas 181 million deliveries therefore it makes sense for volkswagen to invest in smaller ev makers like rivian to accelerate that highergrowth business its all about the cash as for rivian that investment should allay some concerns about its cash flows and future projects it still needs to open its 5 billion plant in georgia ramp up its production of its own enduro drive units to boost its gross margins launch its r2 r3 and r3x suvs in 2026 and 2027 and fulfill amazons longterm order for 100000 electric delivery vans through 2030 story continues rivian ended the first quarter of 2024 with 905 billion in total liquidity but analysts expect it to post a net loss of 469 billion for the full year therefore volkswagens big investment should buy it a lot more time to achieve its longterm goals rivian ceo rj scaringe said the partnership would secure its capital needs for substantial growth rivian still looks undervalued rivian expects its annual production to nearly flatline at 57000 vehicles this year as it faces tougher macro headwinds more competition and a temporary shutdown of its main plant in normal illinois to upgrade its production capabilities but its still aiming to achieve a positive gross margin per vehicle by the fourth quarter of this year as economies of scale kick in analysts believe rivian can increase its revenue at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 34 from 2023 to 2026 as it rolls out its new vehicles with an enterprise value of 126 billion it still looks fundamentally cheap at just 3 times this years sales tesla which is growing at a much slower rate trades at 8 times this years sales if rivian can get its act together ramp up its production and avoid more delays and disappointments it could fetch a much higher valuation in the future volkswagens investment is a vote of confidence in its ability to achieve those goals and rivian could generate big multibagger gains over the next few years if it overcomes its more pressing challenges should you invest 1000 in rivian automotive right now before you buy stock in rivian automotive consider this the motley fool stock advisor analyst team just

A0534,2024-07-07,309,Companies Paid Their Investors $16 Billion More in Dividends Last Quarter. These 2 Magnificent Stocks Helped Drive the Increase.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-paid-investors-16-billion-122600735.html,companies have been increasingly generous in distributing a portion of their profits to shareholders over the past year us companies paid a net 16 billion more in dividends during the second quarter according to sp dow jones indices that was slightly more than the net increase in the first quarter and about four times higher than in the prioryear period many companies contributed to the increase by initiating a dividend or raising their payout however two companies stood out as the biggest drivers of the boost in dividend payments last quarter alphabet nasdaq goognasdaq googl and meta platforms nasdaq meta heres a closer look at these two magnificent dividend stocks a monster dividend tech titan and magnificent seven member alphabet initiated a regular quarterly dividend in late april it made its first payment of 020 per share in midjune alphabets initial dividend seems small relative to its stock price it currently has a 04 dividend yield well below the sp 500s 13 yield however its massive on an absolute basis it will cost the company about 10 billion per year that made it the most meaningful contributor to the second quarters increase in dividend payments the technology giant can easily afford that monster payment the company generated 168 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter alone it also had 108 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet against a mere 132 billion of longterm debt that strong financial position enabled the company to add a whopping 70 billion to its share repurchase program alphabets initial dividend is likely only the starting point given the companys financial strength and earnings growth more than 50 in the first quarter it should be able to steadily increase its dividend payment in the future another magnificent dividend alphabets dividend initiation followed in the footsteps of fellow magnificent seven member meta platforms which initiated a dividend during the first quarter the social media giant is paying 050 per share each quarter like alphabet meta platforms dividend might seem small at first glance given its low 04 dividend yield however its total payments will tally a massive 44 billion per year thats the secondhighest absolute dividend increase this year more than double the newly minted dividends of salesforce 15 billion and booking holdings 12 billion add that trio to alphabets recently initiated payment and 53 of this years net increase in dividends has come from those four new dividend stocks story continues meta platforms can also easily afford to pay its mammoth dividend the company generated 125 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter and had 581 billion of cash equivalents and marketable securities on its balance sheet the companys robust financial position is giving it the flexibility to invest heavily in ai while also returning generous amounts of cash to shareholders through its recently initiated dividend and share repurchase program meta bought back 146 billion in shares during the first quarter while paying about 13 billion in dividends the company is in an excellent position to increase its dividend in the future in addition to its strong financial profile metas earnings are growing briskly over 110 increase in the first quarter the companys heavy investment in ai could drive robust future growth companies are doling out more dividends companies in the sp 500 are on track to pay 6 more in dividends this year thats an acceleration from last years increase 52 thanks in part to the recently initiated dividends from magnificent seven members meta platforms and alphabet that upward trend in dividend payments appears likely to continue many companies especially large technology companies are flush with cash and briskly growing their free cash flow that puts them in an excellent position to continue lining their investors pockets with higher dividend payments so if youre looking to make some extra money investing in dividend stocks could be

A0538,2024-07-07,309,Better Megacap Stock: Nvidia vs. Microsoft,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-megacap-stock-nvidia-vs-124400600.html,lets face it 2024 has been all about the megacaps nvidia nasdaq nvda is up 147 year to date meta platforms is up 44 alphabet is up 33 moreover nvidia apple microsoft amazon alphabet and meta platforms now boast a combined market cap of 156 trillion thats roughly equivalent to the size of the eurozone economy which has an annual gross domestic product of 154 billion according to the latest estimates from the world bank so lets compare two of the best megacaps nvidia and microsoft nasdaq msft to see which is better positioned to rule the second half of 2024 and beyond image source getty images nvidia no company has experienced a more remarkable growth in its market cap over the past two years than nvidia the semiconductor giant has added a staggering 27 trillion in value catapulting it to the position of the most valuable company on earth if only briefly its rise is almost entirely thanks to the surge in demand for artificial intelligence ai and the hardware behind it nvidia designs graphics processing units gpus these powerful devices are often linked together by the thousands even hundreds of thousands within data centers to help train the latest and greatest ai models while there are other companies in the gpu design space nvidia enjoys several key competitive advantages the trust and familiarity ai developers have with nvidias gpus and its software make it challenging for them to switch to another supplier moreover nvidias extensive experience in gpu design prior to the ai boom gives it a unique edge over its competitors microsoft despite the attention garnered by nvidias rapid ascent its important not to overlook microsofts impressive stock performance the company once again holds the title of the most valuable company on earth a position it regained after briefly being overtaken by nvidia to maintain this lead microsoft is demonstrating its adaptability to the evolving tech landscape particularly the ai revolution on that front microsoft has already begun integrating ai into its signature software applications it now offers a generative ai assistant through its microsoft copilot addon which can analyze data respond to queries create images and generate code whats more microsoft diverse business segments provide a layer of protection should the ai revolution falter the company has a massive cloud services unit and a successful gaming division among various other business segments which stock is a better buy in the second half of 2024 simply put both nvidia and microsoft are outstanding companies they generate billions in revenue profits and free cash flow theyre also led by some of the top ceos on the planet satya nadella at microsoft and jensen huang at nvidia story continues however there are differences to evaluate for one nvidias valuation is approaching record highs its pricetosales ps ratio is now 39x more than double its 10year average of 15x meanwhile microsofts ps ratio is also historically high at 14x however that value is less than half of nvidias on an absolute basis msft ps ratio chart in other words both stocks are historically expensive but nvidia is far more costly in a headtohead comparison at any rate the rapid growth of the gpu market is what investors are counting on to bring nvidias valuation down and while those growth estimates are impressive analysts expect nvidias sales to rise 98 over last year any signs of slowing growth could lead to a sharp selloff in nvidia shares in conclusion i prefer microsoft given the stocks more reasonable valuation at current levels that said longterm nvidia investors shouldnt bail on the stock now rather they should remember that one of the keys to successful buyandhold investing is to let winners run should you invest 1000 in microsoft right now before you buy stock in microsoft consider this

A0539,2024-07-07,309,Hedge Funds That Piled Into Big Tesla Short Stung by Huge Rally,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-piled-big-tesla-160000662.html,bloomberg — hedge funds piled into short bets against tesla inc tsla right before the electric vehicle maker unveiled a set of numbers that triggered a hefty shareprice rally most read from bloomberg about 18 of the 500plus hedge funds tracked by data provider hazeltree had an overall short position on tesla at the end of june the highest percentage in more than a year according to figures shared with bloomberg that compares with just under 15 at the end of march those contrarian bets now threaten to saddle the hedge funds behind them with losses tesla’s latest vehiclesales results published on july 2 revealed secondquarter deliveries figures that beat average analyst estimates even though sales were down investors pounced on the news driving the company’s shares to a sixmonth high since the beginning of june tesla’s share price has now soared about 40 tesla is likely to see its profit margins improve helped by lower production and raw material costs according to morningstar inc’s seth goldstein one of the top three analysts covering the stock in a bloomberg ranking that tracks price recommendations the company will likely “return to profit growth” next year he said in a note to clients but how tesla handles the market’s intensifying focus on affordable evs will be key he added the development feeds into an ongoing sense of uncertainty around how to treat the wider ev market amid a sea of conflicting dynamics the industry — a key plank in the global race to reach net zero emissions by 2050 — benefits from generous tax credits yet it’s also contending with significant hurdles in the form of tariff wars and even identity politics with some consumers rejecting evs as a form of “woke” transport in the us donald trump has said that if he becomes president again after november’s election he’ll undo existing laws supporting batterypowered vehicles calling them “crazy” that said trump is a “huge fan” of tesla’s cybertruck according to elon musk the ev giant’s chief executive officer meanwhile the list of internal disruptions at tesla is long in april musk told staff to brace for major job cuts with sales roles among those affected and the cybertruck tesla’s first new consumer model in years has been slow to ramp up story continues for that reason some hedge fund managers have decided the stock is off bounds altogether tesla is “very difficult for us to position” said fabio pecce chief investment officer at ambienta where he oversees 700 million including managing the ambienta x alpha hedge fund basically it’s not clear whether investors are dealing with “a top company with a great management team” or whether it’s “a challenged franchise with deficient corporate governance” he said however “if trump wins it is truly going to be very positive” for tesla though “obviously not amazing for evs and renewables in general” he said that’s because trump is expected to impose “massive tariffs towards the chinese players” which would be “beneficial” to tesla pecce said investors ended 2023 declaring they’d likely retreat further from green stocks in general and evs specifically according to a bloomberg markets live pulse survey almost twothirds of the 620 respondents said they planned to stay away from the ev sector with close to 60 expecting the ishares global clean energy exchangetraded fund to extend its slide in 2024 the etf has lost 13 so far this year after sinking more than 20 in 2023 the bloomberg electric vehicles price return index whose members include byd co tesla and rivian rivn automotive inc is down about 22 so far in 2024 at the same time the metals and minerals needed to produce batteries are at the mercy of wildly volatile commodities markets with speculators regularly trying to make a quick buck on shifts in supply and demand price volatility means some battery manufacturers are having to adjust to a market in which their profit margins have been getting badly squeezed against that backdrop more traditional automakers are finding themselves under pressure from shareholders to slow down their capital expenditure on evs with recent examples including porsche ag polestar automotive holding uk plc psny a highend ev manufacturer has lost almost 95 of its value since being spun out of volvo car ab two years ago fisker inc another luxury ev maker saw its value wiped out starting last year and has since filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection soren aandahl founder and cio of texasbased blue orca capital said “valuations in the ev space are so beat up” that he’s now avoiding shorting the sector it’s no longer an obvious contrarian bet because those tend to do best if investors enter “when things are a little bit higher” he said but at this point “a lot of the air’s already come out of the balloon” but eirik hogner deputy portfolio manager at 27 billion hedge fund clean energy transition suggests there may be more pain to come for the wider ev industry there are still “way too many” startups that remain “subscale” and with gross margins that are simply “too low” he said as a result the supplydemand dynamic of the ev market “is still very negative” “ultimately i think you need to see more bankruptcies” before the market starts to look healthier hogner said —with assistance from craig trudell most read from bloomberg businessweek ©2024 bloomberg lp,,,,,,,,Very Old
A0540,2024-07-07,309,Forget Amazon: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-amazon-2-artificial-intelligence-102100151.html,shares of amazon nasdaq amzn hit an alltime high this week after rising 53 over the last 12 months the company has rallied wall street with multiple quarters of stellar financial growth and an expanding role in artificial intelligence ai amazon web services aws dominance in the cloud industry grants the company a promising position in ai as more and more businesses turn to such platforms for their ai needs meanwhile the company has announced a venture into chip design amazon has an exciting outlook in ai and would likely make an asset to any portfolio over the long term however its stock growth over the last year hasnt exactly matched its earnings growth meaning its shares are slightly overpriced for now amzn pe ratio chart this table shows amazon has the highest pricetoearnings pe and pricetofree cash flow ratios out of some of the most prominent names in ai software the figures suggest amazon is currently one of the worstvalued stocks among its peers however two companies stand out as bargain buys in the space indicating they could be worth considering over amazon alphabet nasdaq googl nasdaq goog and apple nasdaq aapl these tech giants are investing heavily in ai and could see significant gains as the industry develops so forget amazon and consider buying these two artificial intelligence stocks now 1 alphabet alphabet is a nobrainer at its current price point the company has delivered significant earnings and stock growth over the last year yet is trading at a bargain price compared to its peers meanwhile alphabet has the brand power tech and cash reserves to go far in ai the companys google cloud platform holds an 11 market share in cloud computing compared to aws 31 its the thirdlargest cloud company after amazon and microsoft however its outpacing both in growth in the first quarter of 2024 google cloud revenue jumped 28 year over year comparatively the same period saw aws sales rise by 17 and microsoft azures revenue increase by 21 alphabet is investing billions in ai and is in a solid position to build a lucrative ai ecosystem around its products as the home of potent brands like android youtube and the many services under google alphabet has countless opportunities to boost its business with ai the company has the potential to offer more efficient digital advertising add generative features to its smartphone operating system better track viewing trends on youtube and create a google search experience closer to openais chatgpt story continues googl chart moreover this chart shows alphabet is a thoroughly reliable stock over the last five years it has beaten amazon in stock and free cash flow growth meanwhile it has delivered a similar rise in operating income in addition to its far bettervalued share price alphabet is a screaming buy right now and a better ai stock than amazon 2 apple apples stock has risen 14 since jan 1 the figure is considerably lower than its peers with amazons and alphabets stocks rising more than 30 during that time apple missed out on the initial boom in ai preferring to take a more gradual approach to the market however recent developments suggest it could come back strong in the coming years bloomberg reported on jul 2 that apple is poised to get an observer role on chatgpt developer openais board the move follows an announcement at apples worldwide developer conference in june that revealed its smart assistant siri will receive a major ai overhaul making it more intuitive and able to answer hundreds of new questions siri will now pass off certain questions to chatgpt as part of the update making the openai platform available to users through its iphones ipads or macs according to bloomberg the board observer role will put apple on par with microsoft corp openais biggest backer and its main ai technology provider apple has been in steep competition with microsoft for years with both leaders in consumer tech and responsible for the two most used computer operating systems as a result apples seat at openais table could bring its ai technology more in line with its rival and boost its entire position in the industry aapl free cash flow chart this table shows that apple is potentially better financially equipped than amazon or microsoft to expand in ai the company is a cash cow with far more free cash flow and operating income over the last five years so despite its slower approach to ai i wouldnt be against it carving out a lucrative position in the sector over the long term alongside its bettervalued stock price apple is worth considering over amazon stock this july should you invest 1000 in alphabet right now before you buy stock in alphabet consider this the motley fool stock advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for

Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-top-cryptocurrency-buy-soars-111700394.html,the cryptocurrency market is notably volatile that can lead to some staggering drops in value but it can also produce some amazing returns in a short amount of time bitcoin crypto btc soared to a new alltime high earlier this year amid fervor of new spot bitcoin etfs coming to the market the biggest cryptocurrency in the market saw its value increase 177 from its october lows to its 73750 high in march its since pulled back to around 60000 per bitcoin as of this writing a pair of wall street analysts think bitcoin could be set for another surge in its price over the next six months reaching 150000 by the end of 2024 a 150 increase fundstrats tom lee and standard chartereds geoff kendrick each expect the cryptocurrency to zoom past its alltime highs later this year image source getty images the most recent challenge for bitcoin is nearly behind it bitcoins price is primarily determined by supply and demand earlier this year the bitcoin halving reduced the rate of the cryptocurrencys supply increase previous halvings have been bullish for bitcoin as demand growth outpaces supply growth however another big influx of supply remains a challenge for bitcoins price just a few days after the most recent bitcoin halving the defunct mt gox bitcoin exchange which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2014 provided good news for creditors mt gox was once the largest bitcoin exchange in the world but suffered a devastating hack in 2014 resulting in the loss of over 850000 bitcoin in april the mt gox trustee said it will start returning some of the lost funds by october in late june the trustee announced plans to begin disbursements in july two years ago the mt gox trustee held 142000 bitcoin which is worth over 85 billion at todays price if the creditors receiving their bitcoin choose to sell it could put a huge amount of downward pressure on bitcoins price that potential selling pressure has been baked into the price of bitcoin over the last few months but demand for bitcoin is mostly based on future expectations and the mt gox settlement is nearly put to bed lee says thats a reason to invest in bitcoin now that was a huge overhang for many years he said in an interview with cnbc but if i was investing in crypto knowing that one of the biggest overhangs is going to disappear in july i think its a reason to actually expect a pretty sharp rebound in the second half he says 150000 per bitcoin is still possible by the end of the year story continues kendrick believes macro events like the us election could have a significant role in the price of bitcoin later this year he sees a scenario where the cryptocurrency reaches 100000 by election day and 150000 by yearend this major source of demand will drive bitcoin higher the biggest potential driver of bitcoins longterm price appreciation is the growing adoption of the asset within institutional portfolios the new spot bitcoin etfs approved in january will usher in a new and easier way for institutional investors to invest in the cryptocurrency many hedge fund managers pounced on the opportunity they had 42 billion invested in the grayscale bitcoin trust nysemkt gbtc and another 32 billion in the ishares bitcoin trust nasdaq ibit as of the end of the first quarter according to sec filings inflows into the bitcoin etfs have died down in the second quarter but the potential for broader adoption among institutional investors remains cathie woods ark invest expects bitcoin to play a major role in institutional investor portfolios in the future the analysts figure a 1 allocation of investable assets in bitcoin will push the price of the cryptocurrency to 120000 but they see potential for a much higher allocation as more institutions drive demand higher and supply growth continues to slow theres plenty of room for the bitcoin price to move higher whether it reaches 150000 by the end of the year its hard to say but the cryptocurrency does have a history of making large moves in a short amount of time if youre bullish on bitcoin the best time to invest is now should you

A0548,2024-07-07,309,Wall Street’s Big Bond Bet Revives Before Pivotal Inflation Data,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-big-bond-bet-190000169.html,bloomberg the bond trade that some of wall street’s biggest banks say will dominate the rest of 2024 is gaining steam before a crucial inflation reading that will help seal the wager’s fate most read from bloomberg the bet — that the us yield curve will normalize toward a steeper slope — is suddenly looking as good as it has in months it got an initial boost after president joe biden’s june 27 debate performance appeared to ease donald trump’s path to retake the white house in its aftermath strategists at banks including citigroup inc jpmorgan chase co and morgan stanley have touted the socalled trump trade the idea is that the republican’s policies on tariffs immigration and deficits will lead investors to demand higher yields on longermaturity treasuries the next leg up in the trade came friday when fresh signs of a softening job market bolstered expectations that the federal reserve will cut interest rates this year spurring a sharp drop in shortdated yields one closely watched measure of the yield curve — the gap between 5 and 30year yields — reached the widest since february after the data easing by the central bank is seen as the steepener bet’s principal driver which heightens the focus on inflation readings ahead this week consumer prices likely rose at the slowest annual pace since january a bloomberg survey shows evidence of further disinflation may remove a major obstacle to the steepener’s success fed officials have been signaling that they’re not ready to lower rates “the steepening because of inflation because of fiscal policy can continue” said cindy beaulieu chief investment officer for north america at conning the trade was a market favorite around the turn of the year as well as investors entered 2024 betting on a series of fed rate cuts instead a resilient economy and sticky inflation derailed wagers on easing when the us bond market closed on june 27 hours before the debate the difference between 5 and 30year yields was about 5 basis points narrower relative to the end of the year the trade in other words was a loser while political developments initiated its revival a more sustainable move requires the fed to cut aggressively that would push shortterm yields down more than those on longer tenors producing what traders call a bullsteepening move story continues what strategists say though steepening of the treasury yield curve may continue in the short term we think recent bear steepening may soon conclude in favor of bull steepening once the fed begins its ratecut cycle though there are periods when the yield curve bull or bear flattens the large moves in the curve are related to how the front end moves suggesting federal reserve policy is key to the direction of the yield curve —ira jersey and christopher cain read more here but there are few signs that the economy is fading to a degree that would trigger an imminent rescue from the fed nor do policymakers seem to be confident enough that inflation is cooling sufficiently “when we look at recent jobs and inflation data we do not see the case for a lot of cuts this cycle” said baylor lancastersamuel chief investment officer at amerant investments inc “there’s certainly a risk that this fed will continue to hold rates at a restrictive level well into 2025 so the risk is that we don’t get that aggressive bull steepening anytime soon” goldman sachs group inc strategists are also skeptical toward the steepener they expect the 5 to 30year gap to be basically unchanged in the fourth quarter from current levels strategist bill zu points out that when trump initiated the trade war with china during his presidency yields declined and the curve flattened as tariffs weighed on productivity and growth in addition the relatively small difference in the outlook for us deficits under the two candidates’ policies suggests that any supplydriven yield repricing based on the election should be “modest at best” he said on the other end of the spectrum strategists at td securities anticipate that the spread between 5 and 30year yields will eventually quadruple from now to 100 basis points fed cuts are integral to that call which the bank has held since last year but so is the threat of high deficits no matter which party prevails in november td’s gennadiy goldberg and his team wrote late last month greg wilensky head of us fixed income at janus henderson investors said he’s “moderately” positioned for a steeper curve by being overweight the fiveyear part of the curve and underweight longer maturities the state of the economy will be the main trigger for the strategy rather than politics he said “the data that we’re going to see is going to hopefully increase the probability that a soft landing can be achieved and the fed can start cutting rates” he said “that’ll

Overspending.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-big-problem-with-couples-retiring-at-different-times-overspending-090050987.html,my husband exited his fulltime job in april and i am freaking out about how much we are spending as he embarks on his travel adventures and we have some major home repairs up ahead no im not crazy nor alone the problem is the amount we spend each year is far from stable and predictable for the majority of retirees according to a recent report and that means trouble if youre planning for a smoothsailing retirement “a majority of retirees experience significant changes in their spending patterns over time about half experience ongoing volatility or an annual change of 20 or more — either higher or lower” sharon carson a retirement strategist at jpmorgan asset management and the author of the report told me the big trouble however is with couples retiring at different times — and how it impacts longterm financial security more than half of american households do not retire all at once if you count individuals working in retirement and spouses retiring at different times count me in this cohort the result is that 6 in 10 couples “experience spending volatility at the beginning of retirement and experience both major ups and downs from year to year” carson said whats the deal the concern is that spending surges at the beginning of retirement can seriously ding a retirement plan since early and unexpected withdrawals can damage overall longterm returns one of our deepest fears about retirement is outliving our money so figuring out just how much to pull from retirement accounts for living expenses each year is unsettling take too much and the future could be bleak read more how much money should i have saved by 50 retirees who take steps to increase their nonretirement portfolio income through strategies like pushing back receiving social security checks to full retirement age ideally age 70 or working longer are in the best shape to weather variable spending and withdrawals but few are doing that more than 4 in 10 americans turn on their social security benefit as soon as they are eligible at age 62 in reality few couples retire at the same time among those currently retired only 11 left the workforce at the same time according to a report by ameriprise the good old 4 rule we’re pushed incessantly to save as much as we can during our working years when we retire this shifts from saving to spending and panic sets in how much someone can spend each year from their retirement accounts is unique to their circumstances the 4 withdrawal rate is a percentage that has been the standard for years and still is used as a flagpole the financial advisers i reached out to this week said in other words if you have say 1 million saved youd take out 40000 story continues but what if your spending surges as it does for many partially retired couples oh man that can be a mess the jpmorgan study analyzed spending patterns from more than 280000 chase customers “these findings are important since an individual’s financial life may be intertwined with a partner’s” carson said read more retirement planning a stepbystep guide she’s right about that the traditional spending in retirement model has changed drastically in the last two decades as dualincome couples have become the majority of american households fifty years ago husbands were the breadwinner in 85 of marriages according to data from the pew research center spending in retirement varies from year to year and is far from stable and predictable for the majority of retirees carson said when you add in spouses retiring at different times thats very significant dualearning couples she added have put a new wrinkle on things and some of the planning tools and conversations havent quite caught up with that yet” the expectation is that our spendingliketheworld’sonfire phase postworking will taper off as we adjust to paying ourselves from our savings but when couples play out their financial plan together it’s not as straightforward as you might imagine sure we imagine that we ratchet up our spending a bit the first year or so for travel and reward ourselves for our years of hard work but then we tap the brakes that’s how most financial planners have typically approached the blueprint for couples budgeting retirement spending — a smooth drop in spending to a steadyeddy level but that’s not what is happening “we thought oh were probably going to see a lot of people downshift their spending after retirement” carson said “and we did downshifting then we saw upshifting and then we saw downshifting beware those spending splurges in retirement image getty creative alan schein photography via getty images these partially retired couples are also spending more to pay down their credit card revolving debt per the report “so theyre getting on better financial footing which is the good news” carson said hurray heres how couples who dont retire at the same time can manage retirement spending surges have an honest talk about spending before one of you retires “often retirement means some income goes away and the spending goes up because now you have time to do the things that youve been postponing or dreaming of all this time — that’s one of the most fraught parts of the conversation that i have with clients” stephanie mccullough founder and chief executive of sofia financial told me spending conversations with soontoberetired couples are often fraught said stephanie mccullough founder and chief executive of sofia financial middle photo courtesy of stephanie mccullough stephanie mccullough of course matters of spending and overall money concerns vary widely between us “situations are all so different its hard to generalize” christine benz morningstar’s director of personal finance and retirement planning said “the stillworking persons salary may or may not cover all of the households living expenses if it doesnt and the couple needs to pull some money from the portfolio to meet their living expenses its actually a great trial run because people often struggle with spending from their portfolios this is retirement spending with training wheels” get comfortable with spending spending in retirement should be well fun it’s not always so “one thing that has surprised me in conversation with people is that those who are either retired or on the verge of retiring feel extremely uncomfortable enjoying their money or spending it at all” said aja evans a financial therapist in new york “learning to spend comfortably and responsibly is just as important as saving and investing for your future there is a lot of guilt that can come up when it comes time to live off your retirement and not seeing money come in at the same time” one way to take control is to hash it out as openly as you can “a lot of fear anxiety stress worry and anger can come up if left unaddressed” evans said as for my situation weve got a meeting next week with our financial adviser i feel my nerves racing already kerry hannon is a senior columnist at yahoo finance she is a

parliament in sundays election with a leftist alliance unexpectedly taking the top spot ahead of the far right in a major upset that was set to prevent marine le pens national rally rn from running the government the outcome if confirmed will leave parliament divided in three big groups with hugely different platforms and no tradition of working together the rn was set to come third according to

currency analyst mufg london its looking like a hung parliament and the rn hasnt done as well as expected whereas the left leaning parties have performed over the last week or so currency markets have moved to price out a lot of the risk premium anyway so i think for now its going to be a wait and see what happens in terms of the trying to form a government and kind of negotiations that will try to take place in the coming weeks this will ultimately dictate what happens next for the for the euro just based on the exit polls were not looking for a sharp move lower for the euro he spoke after the initial dip aneeka gupta macroeconomic research director wisdomtree london we should get a brief respite in the market i think it should breathe in a fresh rally because we’re not seeing an extremist rn majority take place but it’s likely to lead to political gridlock at least until the autumn of 2025 it’s going to be very hard to actually go ahead and pass any policy and bring about any progressive reforms because each party’s vote is split and no one has an absolute majority i would say it’s a bit of a tricky situation i think the markets will be happy we’re avoiding this extreme situation with the far right marchel alexandrovich economist saltmarsh economics london the result is a surprise with the left wing alliance doing much better than expected however fundamentally it still suggests a period of difficult cohabitation for macron and it will be a challenge for him to push forward with a strong legislative agenda cornelia woll president and professor hertie school berlin all in all emmanuel macrons risky bet has not produced a clear parliamentary majority he now finds himself in the same situation as before in which his party has no backing to push through ambitious legislative proposals … this unstable situation will now be the new normal until summer 2025 as the constitution prohibits the president from dissolving parliament again before a year has passed simon harvey head of fx analysis monex europe london it looks like the antifar right parties really got a lot of support but fundamentally from a market perspective there’s no difference in terms of the outcome there’s really going to be a vacuum when it comes to france’s legislative ability the bond market is going to be the real place to look at there might be a bit of a gap lower in french bonds prices we’re in for a period of policymaking not being able to do anything sizeable really and truly the reaction should be minimal if we do see one it will be towards higher yields lower euro and lower french stocks the real question is who’s going to be running and who’s going to be the next prime minister we’re not going to see much in terms of fiscal policy holger schmieding chief economist berenberg london this projected result is a serious relief for europe as the euroscpetic farright appear to have done far less well than expected the tail risks have been avoided the left alliance although strong is not close to a majority and marine le pen is far behind far away from the majority still it will be difficult for france to form a government and as the most likely potential outcome is now some arrangement between parts of the left and president emmanuel macron that will likely mean that macron has to shift and the left will be able to have some influence on policy this could mean some reform reversals rather than further reforms the outcome i would say is less bad than could have been the case it could have been much worse for markets basically the tail risks have been avoided and although the left has unaffordable spending plans the left will need allies and will only be able to implement some of their promises jan von gerich chief market analyst nordea helsinki while the initial french election results still raise many questions financial markets are likely to greet the vote with some relief the results appear to show that the more moderate forces still ally in the second round against more extreme candidates which also has repercussions for the next presidential election that said the economic programme of the left is in many ways much more problematic than that of the right and while the left will not be able to govern on their own the outlook for french public finances deteriorates further with these results it is thus reasonable to expect somewhat higher risk premia in french assets to prevail also beyond the initial market reaction ben laidler head of equity strategy bradesco bbi london there’s obviously going to be a little bit of relief that the far right fell short much more than expected but we’re still left with an uncomfortable surprise of the left wing doing much better than expected that’s going to probably bring an end to this tentative euro and french stocks rally we’ve seen over the last couple of days it represents more uncertainty from an angle that markets had maybe taken their eye off one caveat though is that a big slug of this euro rally had nothing to do with what was going on in france it had a lot to do with the dollar weakening on clearer signs of the us economy slowing that’s going to take a little bit of time to digest but this is going to be a hung parliament there’s going to be limited ability for anybody to be able to do too much,,,,,,,,Very Old

Investing.com,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3509544,after a holidayshortened week investors will closely watch the upcoming inflation report which is the key highlight of the upcoming week last week the labor market showed fresh signs of moderation junes nonfarm payroll figures showed an increase of 206000 jobs a slight decrease from mays revised count of 218000 moreover the us unemployment rate experienced a slight uptick moving from 4 to 41 which surpasses the federal reserves projection of a 4 rate for the current year inflationary pressures which have been a concern for both markets and policymakers may also be showing signs of easing the isms prices paid index which can foreshadow the inflation trends for goods and services reported lowerthanexpected figures aligning with the lowest rates since the pandemics end furthermore the annual wage gains from the nonfarm jobs report were at 39 a decrease from mays 41 and one of the lowest since the pandemic “in our view if inflation continues to moderate and the economy softens but does not fall into a downturn or recession markets should continue to perform well it implies the fed will likely begin its interest ratecutting cycle even as the economy is growing near trend levels” edward jones strategists said in a note “if the economy falters and the fed must cut rates to support growth markets will likely not hold up as well – but we don’t see signs of this keep in mind that the economy and labor market started from a position of outsized strength that may now be gradually normalizing” here’s your look at whats happening in markets for the week ahead president biden president joe biden faced increased skepticism from within his own party regarding his potential 2024 reelection campaign the concerns were not alleviated following his recent interview with abc news which was anticipated to address these issues adding to the democratic unease two additional lawmakers rep mike quigley from illinois and rep angie craig from minnesota publicly urged biden to reconsider his intention to run for president again the calls from quigley and craig for biden to step aside come as a notable development considering their status as members of his party their statements contribute to a larger sentiment of doubt that has been slowly surfacing among democratic lawmakers strategists and donors the increasing voices of dissent within the democratic party suggest a search for alternative strategies or candidates that could strengthen their chances in the forthcoming electoral contest “it is hard for us to see how this uncertainty can drag out for more than another few weeks” td cowen strategists wrote powell’s speech federal reserve chair jerome powell is set to testify tuesday and wednesday before the senate and house respectively while the hearings are mainly focused on monetary policy td cowen analysts also said they expect to see some questions regarding many regulatory questions “we expect many questions on basel 3 endgame longterm debt for regional banks and liquidity requirement changes” the strategists said “our expectation is that powell will use those questions to set expectations for the basel 3 endgame capital proposal the regional bank longterm debt proposal and the expected proposal on bank liquidity changes” cpi the inflation report for june is set to be presented on thursday jule 11 the street expectations call for a 01 mom and 31 yoy change the core cpi is expected to increase by 02 bank of america is aligned with the street on both headline and core figures however it expects the yoy change to come in at 32 “should the cpi report print in line with our expectations we would maintain our expectation for the fed to start its cutting cycle in december” bank of america economists wrote “that said we do acknowledge that another 02 mm print for core cpi would tilt the risk towards an earlier cut especially given signs of softening activity” q2 earnings season as the early reports of the q2 earnings season begin to emerge indications point to a robust performance for companies projections for the second quarter of 2024 suggest earnings increase of 86 compared to the same period in the previous year with revenues also expected to rise by 47 this anticipated growth rate is the most significant since the 99 uptick observed in the first quarter of 2022 the positive revisions trend leading up to this earnings cycle has set the stage for what appears to be a period

materialize in a bull case in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet” new street highlighted that the consensus expects revenue growth to decelerate to the midteens which may be at risk due to potential reductions in hyperscale capital expenditures and growing competition from asics and amd nasdaq analysts indicated that without a change in outlook they do not see further upside for the stock they warned of the risk of a possible derating noting the stock currently trades at 40x next twelve months earnings per

past five years they expect the companys allflash storage market share to stabilize around 15 ubss revenue projections for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 are 6 and 10 below consensus respectively the downgrade also reflects a decrease in market share with pures share of the allflash storage market falling by approximately 80 basis points to 145 in the last twelve months as competitors like netapp nasdaq s cseries gain traction with enterprise customers moreover ubs noted the stocks significant rise about 83 yeartodate compared to the s 15 gain despite a 1 drop in revenue expectations for

indicating a 22 upside after less than 10 eps growth over the last three years goldman sees ice’s eps growth inflecting higher into the low teens in 2025 and beyond this is supported by structural tailwinds and ice’s global leadership in energy markets which account for approximately 30 of earnings these factors are expected to drive over 25 revenue growth in 2024e with an estimated 810 growth beyond 2024 signs of accelerating growth in fixed income data analytics which make up about 22 of earnings the firm’s asv is recovering and flows into fixed income funds are rebounding yeartodate a cyclical trough in mortgage tech which accounts for around 16 of earnings origination activity is stabilizing and ice’s organic initiatives are taking shape driving high singledigit to low doubledigit revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 the research team expects the high incremental margin from ice’s fastestgrowing exchange revenues to support approximately 100 basis points per year operating margin expansion this along with high free cash flow conversion is predicted to drive a faster pace of delevering and higher share repurchases by the end of 2024 goldman believes these dynamics are

pure storage shares from neutral to sell citing an unfavorable riskreward scenario the analysts at ubs estimate a growth rate of approximately 8 over the next five years for pstg a decrease from the 16 growth rate experienced in the previous five years they predict that pstg’s market share in the allflash sector will plateau at around 15 furthermore ubs’s revenue forecasts for fy26 and fy27 are 6 and 10 below consensus respectively the analysts have observed a decline in pstg’s last twelve months market share of the allflash storage market by about 80 basis points to 145 as competitors like netapp’s nasdaqntap cseries gain traction with enterprise customers despite a 1 decline in revenue expectations for both fy25 and fy26 pstg’s shares have surged approximately 83 yeartodate outpacing the sp 500’s 15 increase this indicates that the stock’s appreciation has been driven entirely by multiple expansion to an elevated level of approximately 6 times evrevenue ubs also notes that pstg’s valuation has been overly influenced by optimistic views on ai infrastructure investments driving growth however the analysts believe that airelated storage spending will likely grow slower than the market anticipates with a greater focus on inference—a market segment with slower growth compared to training furthermore private vendors such as weka vast data and hammerspace are gaining market share as demonstrated by meta’s nasdaqmeta nasdaq partnership with hammerspace to develop and implement a parallel network file system in its genai clusters this trend further supports ubs’s decision to downgrade pure shares to sell sell at ubs means “stock price expected to fall within three months from the time the rating was assigned because of a specific catalyst or event fsr is 6 below the

on wednesday shortened trading day in the us markets citi downgraded charter communications nasdaqchtr to sell with a 255 price target what’s the full story citi analysts have expressed concerns regarding charters financial outlook citing increased risks to both earnings estimates and market valuation they point to a challenging organic broadband landscape that is proving tougher than previously anticipated which could impact subscriber numbers and revenue growth negatively over the next year analysts believe consensus expectations for charters 2025 ebitda may be overly optimistic given these headwinds in response to these concerns the bank has adjusted its target price downwards reflecting a contraction in the fair valuetoebitda multiple to 60x this adjustment is based on citis own projections which predict lower ebitda figures compared to market consensus for 2025 however analysts at citi acknowledge the potential for future free cash flow recovery once charter navigates through its current phase of heightened capital investments looking ahead citi views charters upcoming second and thirdquarter results as potentially unfavorable catalysts they anticipate these earnings reports to underscore the challenges facing charter particularly in broadband pricing and subscriber volumes the recent discontinuation of acp allchannel programming is highlighted as a contributing factor to these headwinds with analysts expressing skepticism about a nearterm turnaround in this regard sell at citi means “the investment rating definitions are buy etr of 15 or more or 25 or more for high risk stocks and sell for negative etr” how did the stock react charter communications opened the regular session at 29919 and closed at 30125 a gain of 172 percent from the prior

depend on a bullish scenario where post2025 prospects notably improve a development the brokerage currently finds uncertain looking ahead consensus projections anticipate a deceleration in revenue

A0568,2025-01-06,126,Doctors worry that iodine deficiency — a dietary problem from the past — is coming back,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/iodine-deficiency-73e65282708cef12a41df3cf48a9daec,new york ap — the 13yearold boy came to the clinic with a rapidly ballooning neck doctors were puzzled testing ruled out their first suspicion but further tests pinpointed what they — and the boy — had been missing iodine a century ago iodine deficiency affected kids across large swaths of the country it essentially disappeared after some food makers started adding it to table salt bread and some other foods in one of the great public health success stories of the 20th century but today people are getting less iodine because of changes in diet and food manufacturing although most people are still getting enough researchers have increasingly been reporting low levels of iodine in pregnant women and other people raising concerns about an impact on their newborns and there is also a very small but growing number of reports of iodine deficiency in kids “this needs to be on people’s radar” said dr monica serranogonzalez a brown university doctor who treated the boy in 2021 in providence rhode island this article is part of ap’s be well coverage focusing on wellness fitness diet and mental health read more be well what is iodine iodine is a trace element found in seawater and in some soils — mostly in coastal areas a french chemist accidentally discovered it in 1811 when an experiment with seaweed ash created a purple puff of vapor the name iodine comes from a greek word meaning violetcolored later that century scientists began to understand that people need certain amounts of iodine to regulate their metabolism and stay healthy and that it’s crucial in the development of brain function in children one sign of insufficient iodine is a swelling of the neck known as a goiter the thyroid gland in the neck uses iodine to produce hormones that regulate the heart rate and other body functions when there’s not enough iodine the thyroid gland enlarges as it goes into overdrive to make up for the lack of iodine at the beginning of the 20th century goiter was very common in children in certain inland parts of the united states especially in a “goiter belt” that stretched from appalachia and the great lakes to the northwest united states some of the kids were unusually short deaf intellectually stunted and had other symptoms of a syndrome once known as “cretinism” adding iodine to salt public health experts realized they couldn’t solve the problem by feeding everyone seaweed and seafood but they learned that iodine can essentially be sprayed on table salt iodized salt first became available in 1924 by the 1950s more than 70 of us households used iodized table salt bread and some other foods also were fortified with iodine and iodine deficiency became rare but diets changed processed foods now make up a large part of the american diet and though they contain a lot of salt it’s not iodized leading bread brands no longer add iodine in the case of the 13yearold boy he has mild autism and was a fussy eater mostly only eating specific brands of bread and peanut butter and for people who do salt their food the fashion now is to use kosher salt himalayan rock salt or other noniodized products “people have forgotten why there’s iodine in salt” said dr elizabeth pearce of boston medical center she is a leader in the iodine global network a nongovernmental agency working to eliminate iodine deficiency disorders she noted a reported 50 drop in us iodine levels in surveyed americans between the 1970s and the 1990s how much iodine is enough though iodine consumption is falling overall most americans are still getting enough through their diet experts say but doctors worry that’s not the case for women and children who are most vulnerable to iodine deficiency the american academy of pediatrics and other medical societies recommend that all pregnant and breastfeeding women get 150 micrograms of iodine each day you can get that from onehalf to threequarters of a teaspoon of iodized table salt in the last 15 years or so us researchers have increasingly reported seeing mild iodine deficiency in pregnant women a michigan state university study of about 460 pregnant women in the city of lansing found about a quarter of them were not getting enough many prenatal vitamins don’t contain iodine noted jean kerver the study’s lead author that’s why doctors recommend that pregnant or breastfeeding women check labels to ensure they are taking multivitamins or prenatal supplements with iodine some studies have linked even mild iodine deficiency to lower iqs and language delay in children although there is debate about at exactly what levels problems start pearce said experts say there hasn’t been enough research to establish what impact that iodine deficiency has actually been having on the us population in recent years serranogonzalez said she and her colleagues have seen four other cases in children in their clinic in providence “we’re concerned this may be increasing especially in patients with restricted diets”

A0569,2025-01-08,124,College tuition has fallen significantly at many schools,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/college-tuition-cost-5e69acffa7ae11300123df028eac5321,boston ap — the cost of college keeps spiraling ever higher right not necessarily new research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago and tuition increases at private colleges have finally slowed after years of hefty rises figures compiled by the nonprofit college board indicate the average student attending an instate public university this year faces a tuition bill of 11610 which is down 4 from a decade earlier when taking inflation into account but the real savings come in what the average student actually pays after getting grants and financial aid that’s down 40 over the decade from 4140 to 2480 annually according to the data that reduced cost means less borrowing just under half of students attending instate public universities are graduating with some debt down from 59 a decade earlier according to the college board figures and among those who do borrow the average loan balance has fallen by 17 to 27100 meanwhile at private colleges tuition continues to rise but at a much slower rate it has increased 4 over the past decade when taking inflation into account to an average 43350 according to the college board that’s a big change from the two decades prior when tuition increased 68 costs are coming down as americans question whether college is worth the price surveys find that americans are increasingly skeptical about the value of a degree and the percentage of high school graduates heading to college has fallen to levels not seen in decades according to data from the us bureau of labor statistics yet research still finds that over time a degree pays off americans with a bachelor’s degree earn a median of 28 million during their careers 75 more than if they had only a high school diploma according to research from georgetown university’s center on education and the workforce the covid19 pandemic has been a big factor in the cost reductions said jennifer ma an executive research scientist at the college board and lead author of the study “we know that during covid a lot of institutions — public and private — froze tuition” ma said as states and the federal government responded to the pandemic ma said they increased higher education funding allowing colleges to reduce the cost of attendance some of that money has since expired however including an infusion of federal pandemic aid that was mostly used up by the end of 2022 cost was a major consideration in kai mattinson’s decision to attend northern arizona university it would have cost her about 39000 annually to attend the public university but discounts and scholarships bring that down to between 15000 and 20000 for the 22yearold senior from nevada “i originally wanted to go to the university of arizona but when it came down

A0571,2025-01-22,110,Steven Soderbergh: ‘I’m the cockroach of this industry. I can survive any version of it’,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/steven-soderbergh-presence-ae40202b72deda7c29d645578a346b48,new york ap — steven soderbergh isn’t just the director and cinematographer of his latest film he’s also in a way its central character “presence” is filmed entirely from the pov of a ghost inside a home a family has just moved into soderbergh who serves as his own cinematographer under the pseudonym peter andrews his father’s name essentially performs as the presence a floating pointofview that watches as the violence that killed the mysterious ghost threatens to be repeated for even the prolific soderbergh the film which opens friday in theaters was a unique challenge he shot “presence” with a small digital camera while wearing slippers to soften his steps the 62yearold filmmaker recently met a reporter in a midtown manhattan hotel in between finishing postproduction on his other upcoming movie “black bag” a thriller focus features will release march 14 and beginning production in a few weeks on his next project a romantic comedy that he says “feels like a george cukor movie” soderbergh whose films include “out of sight” the “ocean’s 11” movies “magic mike” and “erin brockovich” tends to do a lot in small windows of time “presence” took 11 days to film that dexterous proficiency has made the everexperimenting soderbergh one of hollywood’s most widely respected evaluators of the movie business in a wideranging conversation he discussed why he thinks streaming is the most destructive force the movies have ever faced and why he’s “the cockroach of this industry” ap you use pseudonyms for yourself as a cinematographer and editor were you tempted to credit yourself as an actor for “presence” soderbergh no but what i did is subtle for the first and only time peter andrews has a camera operator credit that’s not a credit that i typically take because i don’t need it and i typically have another operator working with me but i felt like this was a workout it was tricky but really fun it was another level of performance anxiety because i ruined more takes than anyone else in the film by a larger factor i was the one going “cut i f—ed that up we got to go again” ap you made this quickly and inexpensively and then sold it to a distributor was it appealing to work outside the system soderbergh the beauty of projects at this scale is i can just do them without having to talk to anybody it’s not because i don’t want notes it’s because it’s just the brain trust and none of the psychic real estate is taken up by things that have nothing to do with what you’re going to shoot i went from that into a more traditional project in which a lot of psychic real estate gets taken up by the process of having a studio finance your movie i like these people it’s just a lot of lawyers like a lot of lawyers ap you’ve called streaming the most destructive force in movie history what most irks you about it soderbergh it removes a key reference point for an artist it’s helpful to know how something is doing or how it did you need to know that to calibrate whether you accomplished what you wanted to accomplish whether you can work at a certain level that’s one of the most confusing things about it the black box of it apart from the economic invisibility of what’s going on there — the fact that we can’t really look under the hood of how these streaming companies work economically — there’s another kind of handrail that’s missing that i find really helpful at the end of the day i at least want to know the market will tell you how you’re doing i want to know that so i can adjust or go in another direction being irrelevant isn’t very appealing what is the overlap between what people seem to be responding to and what i like because i don’t want to make these things and have nobody see them i’ve had enough people say “oh did that come out” it’s a public art form ap how do you suspect the audience is changing soderbergh the good news is if you talk to focus features and neon and a24 young people are going to the movies this is the letterboxd generation that’s fantastic i hope that ripples outside the us they are cineliterate and they expect something singular they want the signature they want the stamp of a filmmaker and that’s turning into a real business one of the things i think we all need to do but especially the people who cover the industry is to stop using the studio metric for what a success is that’s not a template you should be applying to everything ap do you ever lament that the movies that made you want to be a filmmaker like “all the president’s men” and “chinatown” occupied a different place in the culture than today’s films soderbergh there was a period of about 10 to 14 year where the best movies of the year were also the most popular movies of the year that’s not necessarily true anymore you can pick one of the movies that’s in the hunt this year and go that’s a ’70s movie that’s as good and interesting as one of those but it’s not going to do the business that one of those would have done it’s the artist’s job to adapt when it comes to trying to control what people want to go see you’re now in a place like “if i really wish hard it won’t rain” the weather is the weather to a certain degree the audience is a weather system luckily because of the way i began i’m the cockroach of this industry i can survive any version of it ap you’ve described feeling a need to immediately “annihilate” whatever you just made by starting on something vastly different soderbergh yeah when you see “black bag” you’re like “oh that’s different” there are more shots in the first four minutes of “black bag” than the entirety of “presence” it’s a different thing and it has different demands ap it’s not exhausting to reinvent yourself every movie soderbergh no it feels more like a natural evolution and a natural response in the sense of i want to be a different filmmaker for this i don’t want to know the outcome if you have a conversation with a filmmaker who says they have “figured things out” you should run in the other direction it’s like you’re deluded and you have a very superficial understanding of what this art form demands if you’re not humbled by what it asks of you to be distinctive ap do you feel you’ve gotten closer there might not be a filmmaker alive who’s tried more ways to make a movie than you have soderbergh no i still feel like i’m reaching for something i quite possibly won’t ever grasp and maybe shouldn’t as frustrating as it may be to feel like i’ve never made a thing that is at the level of one of my heroes made i don’t know what i’d do if i did feel that do you stop then the movie “come and see” that guy got to basically go “that’s my mic drop” i’ve never made anything approaching that ap it wouldn’t be the only film i’d suggest but i think “out of sight” is pretty darn perfect soderbergh oh i’m very happy with that film i’m very proud of that film i can’t say there’s much in it that i’d go back and change that said it’s not “apocalypse now” or “the third man” by my standards i don’t look at it and go “that’s as good as ‘the third man’” i’m good at pushing myself into areas that are slightly beyond my comfort zone but i also understand what my limitations are i’m inherently not a grandiose thinker about myself or my work that’s a critical component to some of the films i’m talking about that i think are amazing i could never make “apocalypse now” i don’t think of myself as a filmmaker the way francis ford coppola thinks of himself that’s not he should be like me or i should be like him it’s just how we’re built i’m more earthbound i guess is the word and that’s what i like and what i’m good at ap do you have any idea why soderbergh i think it’s the way i was born and the way i was raised and the people who were around me when i was younger who mentored me i just don’t think i was born with the grandiosity gene and there was nobody around me who would have cultivated that even if i had shown signs going to sundance last year with “presence” was really gratifying if you’d told me 35 years later you’re going to come back here where “sex lies and videotape” premiered in 1989 with a movie that people are interested in seeing i would have wept,,,,,,,,Old

A0573,2025-01-31,101,Trump administration fires prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 cases and moves toward ousting FBI agents,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/trump-fbi-firing-a7b19a5f414ce82c6f6b5f6656000d23,washington ap — the trump administration on friday fired a group of prosecutors involved in the jan 6 criminal cases and demanded the names of fbi agents involved in those same probes so they can possibly be ousted moves that reflect a white house determination to exert control over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees seen as insufficiently loyal acting deputy attorney general emil bove ordered the firings of the jan 6 prosecutors days after president donald trump’s sweeping clemency action benefiting the more than 1500 people charged in the us capitol attack according to a memo obtained by the associated press about two dozen employees at the us attorney’s office in washington were terminated said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel issues a separate memo by bove identified more than a halfdozen fbi senior executives who were ordered to retire or be fired by monday and also asked for the names titles and offices of all fbi employees who worked on investigations into the jan 6 2021 us capitol riot — a list the bureau’s acting director said could number in the thousands bove who has defended trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration said justice department officials would then carry out a “review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary” “as we’ve said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles we are going to follow the law follow fbi policy and do what’s in the best interest of the workforce and the american people — always” acting fbi director brian driscoll wrote in a letter to the workforce the prosecutors fired in the dc us attorney’s office had been hired for temporary assignments to support the jan 6 cases but were moved into permanent roles after trump’s presidential win in november according to the memo obtained by the ap bove the acting deputy attorney general said he would not “tolerate subversive personnel actions by the previous administration” any mass firings at the fbi would be a major blow to the historic independence from the white house of the nation’s premier federal law enforcement agency but would be in keeping with trump’s persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will it would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees following the forced ousters of a group of senior fbi executives earlier this week as well as a broad termination by the justice department of prosecutors on special counsel jack smith’s team who investigated trump the fbi agents association said the reported efforts to oust agents represented “outrageous actions by acting officials” that were “fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by president trump and his support for fbi agents” “dismissing potentially hundreds of agents would severely weaken the bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the bureau and its new leadership for failure” the association said in a statement it was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might take but the bureau has a welldefined process for terminations and any abrupt action that bypasses that protocol could presumably open the door to a legal challenge when pressed during his confirmation hearing thursday trump’s pick for fbi director kash patel said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish fbi employees who were involved in the trump investigations patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the fbi’s internal review processes for taking action against employees asked by democratic sen cory booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that don’t follow that standard process patel said “i don’t know what’s going on right now over there but i’m committed to you senator and your colleagues that i will honor the due process of the fbi” before he was nominated for the director’s position patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about what he called antitrump “conspirators” in the government and news media who he said needed to be rooted out trump has for years expressed fury at the fbi and justice department over investigations that shadowed his presidency including an inquiry into ties between russia and his 2016 campaign and continued over the last four years he fired one fbi director james comey amid the russia investigation and then replaced his second christopher wray just weeks after his win in november asked at the white house on friday if he had anything to do with the scrutiny of the agents he said “no but we have some very bad people over there it was weaponized at a level that nobody’s never seen before they came after a lot of people — like me – but they came after a lot of people” he added “if they fired some people over there that’s a good thing because they were very bad” the fbi and smith’s team investigated trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his maralago estate in florida both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after trump’s november presidential win because of longstanding justice department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president the justice department also charged more than 1500 trump supporters in connection with the capitol riot though trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them — including the ones convicted of violent crimes — through pardons sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments this week the justice department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on smith investigations and a group of senior fbi

A0581,2025-03-07,66,Fed Chair Powell says interest rates on hold with economic uncertainty widespread,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-prices-67791b46f1ad3c197975a75ee35226be,new york ap — the federal reserve is likely to keep its key interest rate unchanged in the coming months as it waits for widespread “uncertainty” stemming from president donald trump’s policies to resolve chair jerome powell said friday at a conference in new york powell said the trump administration is making policy changes in several areas including trade taxes government spending immigration and regulation and added that the “net effect” of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the fed’s interest rate policies “while there have been recent developments in some of these areas especially trade policy uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high” powell said “as we parse the incoming information we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves we do not need to be in a hurry and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity” most economists say that trump’s plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports including 25 duties on goods from canada and mexico that he partially delayed thursday will push up prices and slow growth but many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy powell’s comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the fed may deliver this year they had been banking on at least three following a stream of weakerthanexpected reports on the us economy but powell reiterated the fed is likely on hold for a while that sent treasury yields higher in the bond market rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages auto loans credit cards and business loans powell in a question and answer session acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a “onetime” price increase rather than persistent inflation and the fed could ignore such a temporary effect treasury secretary scott bessent on thursday made a similar argument “we could get a onetime price adjustment” bessent said before adding “i’m not worried about inflation” yet powell also said there were other considerations the fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged or even raise rates for example powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a onetime impact “if it turns into a series” of tariff hikes or “if the increases are larger that would matter” “what really does matter is what is happening with longterm inflation expectations” powell added powell noted that shorterterm expectations have risen partly out of concern about tariffs though longerterm expectations have been stable expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase when trump imposed tariffs in his last administration powell noted the fed ended up reducing its key rate “because growth weakened so much” powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite “elevated uncertainty” he characterized friday’s jobs report which showed employers added 151000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 41 as in line with the “solid” gains of the past six months he also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year and said surveys of consumers and businesses “point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook” further complicating matters he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment “have not been a good predictor” of consumer spending in recent years the fed’s own beige book a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released wednesday up from just 17 times in january the fed publishes the beige book eight times a year powell spoke at a conference organized by the university of chicago’s booth school of business president donald trump’s onagain offagain tariff policy and rapidfire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy’s growth to as low as 1 at an annual rate in the first three months of this year down from 23 in last year’s final quarter yet as fed governor christopher waller noted thursday there are “good news” cuts and “bad news” cuts “bad news” cuts occur if the fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing while “good news” reductions are those that reflect a sense by the fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2 waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the fed to engineer “good news” rate cuts later this year though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the fed’s next meeting this month after cutting its key rate three times last year to about 43 powell indicated in january that the fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 25 in january compared with a year ago excluding the volatile food and energy categories core prices rose 26 the smallest increase since june,,,,,,,,Mid-aged

a surprise one by lauryn hill and wyclef jean of the fugees celebrated the life and legacy of the grammywinning singer and pianist roberta flack flack whose intimate vocal and musical style made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after died last month at age 88 she’s bestknown for her transformative covers of “the first time ever i saw your face” and “killing me softly with his song” both were expertly handled by hill at the ceremony held monday afternoon at new york’s abyssinian baptist church wonder followed the set and the rev al sharpton gave the eulogy flack “put a soundtrack to black dignity” sharpton said as many said in their tributes flack’s musical genius stemmed from her ability to seamlessly move between soul jazz gospel and beyond her “celebration of life” memorial was livestreamed at wwwrobertaflackcom and on youtube here are some highlights for the memory of a singing legend a historic location flack’s memorial was open to the public at the abyssinian baptist church a historic harlem institution founded in 1808 it is one of the oldest black baptist churches in the us the church was decorated for the ceremony with stunning white and yellow bouquets seats filled quickly at center a screen showed a young flack at the piano and played highlights of her career later it would broadcast music industry legends paying tribute to flack including clive davisdionne warwick indiaarie and alicia keys it was a fitting location for such a celebration flack grew up with church gospel and her mother played organ at the lomax african methodist episcopal church in arlington virginia as a teen she began accompanying the church choir on piano the ceremony detoured from a program handed out to attendees it featured a powerful quote from flack on the back that arie would include in her message “remember always walk in the light” flack once said “if you feel like you’re not walking in it go find it love the light” celebrating a life in music — through music “her existence was a form of resistance” hill said in her speech holding back tears hill’s appearance was unexpected but fitting in the 1990s her hiphop trio the fugees did a masterful take on flack’s cover “killing me softly with his song” it won the group a grammy two decades after flack took home the record of the year trophy for the song “i adore ms roberta flack” she said “roberta flack is legend” she then launched into a cover of “the first time ever i saw your face” followed by “killing me softly with his song” with the fugees’ wyclef jean — and wonder joining in on harmonica a legend who needed no introduction but certainly received one with roaring applause wonder followed up “the great thing about not having the ability to see with your eyes is the great opportunity of being able to even better see with your heart and so i knew how beautiful roberta was not seeing her visually but being able to see and feel her heart” wonder said he performed his song “if it’s magic” accompanied only by a harpist then he sat at the piano to sing with the harpist a song he wrote for flack “i can see the sun in late december” “i love you roberta and i will see you” wonder said at the end earlier songwriter and performer valerie simpson of ashford simpson played piano and sang an extended take of “ain’t nothing like the real thing” interspersed with recollections of her friend “but that voice aw she’d just grab you in the heart and then when she touched the keys she knew how to dig down deep” simpson said simpson recalled being tapped to perform in “chicago” for her 2018 broadway debut and how she told flack she wasn’t sure if she could act “she looked at me and said ‘girl where’s the script bring it over here we’re going to work on this thing we’re going to do this’” remembered simpson new orleans singer and piano player davell crawford performed a soulful version of flack’s song “just when i needed you” to celebratory shouts and cheers a legendary artist remembered “many of us are here today because she has touched not just our hearts but she also touched our souls” said the rev dr kevin r johnson the senior church pastor who led the service choir performances including a rousing rendition of “amazing grace” came in between a video recollection of flack’s life and scripture readings “the reason we’re here is because she made a difference” sharpton said and we should all ask ourselves when it comes our time will they pack a church for you if roberta were here tonight she would tell you ‘don’t just praise me emulate me’” actor phylicia rashad remembered first seeing flack perform when she was a student at howard university — to an audience that grew rapt by her quiet steady voice flack lived comfortably with her genius and without having to proclaim it to people rashad said “she wore that like a loose fitting garment and lived her life attending to that which she cared for most music love and humanity” rashad said mead gruver contributed to this report from cheyenne wyoming,,,,,,,,Mid-aged

News,https://apnews.com/article/trump-aranceles-canada-c00eb68af7ea36aa48df270e81602dcf,washington ap — la amenaza que lanzó el presidente donald trump el martes de duplicar los aranceles sobre el acero y el aluminio canadiense del 25 al 50 llevó al gobierno de la provincia de ontario a ordenar la suspensión de su plan de aplicar recargos al precio de la electricidad que vende a estados unidos como resultado el asesor comercial de la casa blanca peter navarro dijo que el presidente estadounidense dio marcha atrás en su decisión de duplicar los aranceles sobre el acero y el aluminio aunque el gobierno federal aún planea imponer un gravamen del 25 sobre todas las importaciones de acero y aluminio a partir del miércoles la respuesta de canadá representó una victoria para trump pero también aumentó las preocupaciones en torno a las medidas arancelarias que han agitado al mercado de valores y suscitado riesgos de una recesión la escalada y el enfriamiento en la actual guerra comercial entre estados unidos y canadá únicamente incrementaron la creciente sensación de incertidumbre sobre cómo los aumentos de aranceles de trump afectarán a las economías de ambas naciones trump estremeció los mercados la mañana del martes al afirmar que el aumento de los aranceles que entraría en vigor el miércoles había sido una respuesta al aumento del 25 en el precio de la electricidad que ontario vende a estados unidos “he ordenado a mi secretario de comercio para que añada un arancel adicional del 25 llevándolo al 50 sobre todo el acero y aluminio que ingresa a estados unidos desde canadá una de las naciones con los aranceles más altos de cualquier lugar del mundo” publicó trump el martes en su plataforma truth social el primer ministro de ontario doug ford declaró el martes por la tarde que recibió una llamada del secretario de comercio de estados unidos howard lutnick tras la cual acordó eliminar el incremento de precios añadió que estaba seguro de que el presidente de estados unidos también daría marcha atrás a sus propios planes de aranceles del 50 sobre el acero y el aluminio canadienses “tiene que consultarlo con el presidente pero estoy bastante seguro de que dará marcha atrás” dijo ford sobre la amenaza de trump de gravar el acero y aluminio “de ninguna manera vamos a someternos lo que vamos a hacer es tener una conversación constructiva” después de la caída en los mercados del lunes y el subsecuente nerviosismo el martes trump se enfrenta a una creciente presión por demostrar que cuenta un plan sólido para hacer crecer la economía hasta ahora el mandatario ha ratificado su postura sobre los aranceles y puede señalar el drama del martes como evidencia de que los impuestos sobre las importaciones son una valiosa herramienta de negociación incluso si generan agitación en el mercado de valores trump insinuó el martes que los aranceles son fundamentales para cambiar la economía de estados unidos independientemente de las oscilaciones del mercado de valores el mandatario estadounidense ha dado distintas explicaciones para su antagonismo hacia canadá señaló que sus aranceles del 25 sobre todas las importaciones algunos de los cuales quedaron suspendidos durante un mes se deben al contrabando de fentanilo y ha expresado objeciones a que canadá imponga altos gravámenes a las importaciones de productos lácteos que castigan a los granjeros estadounidenses también ha mantenido su llamado para que canadá se convierta en parte de estados unidos como solución una forma de burla que ha enfurecido a los gobernantes canadienses “lo único que tiene sentido es que canadá se convierta en nuestro querido quincuagésimo primer estado” publicó trump el martes “esto haría que todos los aranceles y todo lo demás desaparezca por completo” tensiones entre estados unidos y canadá el primer ministro entrante de canadá mark carney dijo que su gobierno mantendrá los aranceles hasta que los estadounidenses muestren respeto y se comprometan con el libre comercio después de que trump amenazó con una devastación financiera histórica para canadá carney quien tomará posesión en lugar de justin trudeau en los próximos días dijo que los más recientes aranceles de trump son un ataque a los trabajadores las familias y las empresas canadienses “mi gobierno mantendrá nuestros aranceles hasta que los estadounidenses nos muestren respeto y asuman compromisos creíbles y fiables con el comercio libre y justo” dijo carney en un comunicado los funcionarios canadienses planean imponer aranceles de represalia en respuesta al gravamen sobre el acero y el aluminio los cuales se tiene previsto que se den a conocer el miércoles carney se refería la primera ronda de aranceles de represalia de canadá por 30000 millones de

brunel university but while he is widely celebrated for his work in literature and activism zephaniah’s influence on music remains relatively overlooked emerging from the dub poetry scene zephaniah channelled personal experiences of systemic racism and state violence into intelligent spoken word albums such as rasta combined politically charged poetry with dub rhythms and studio effects laying

– an uplifting intergenerational union years in the making “benjamin was like an older brother to me we were sometimes on the phone for hours” natty says “so when i asked him to be part of a project i was doing he wrote his verse immediately” they recorded at akala’s ladbroke grove studio in london then spent hours listening to zephaniah’s stories – including his rightous refusal of an mbe natty says the vocals were meant for the track badman rastafari mix but when mala reached out the dubstep producer was sent them instead “working with such powerful voices was something else” says mala “their words guided my creative process benjamin’s verse is a reminder to stay true to self and keep growing in heart and spirit rest in peace sir we salute you” natty continues to include the track in his live sets in memory of his friend “whenever we met we’d sometimes spar as we both studied martial arts i remember how strong he was which made his passing even harder to accept he was just a

on growing up in birmingham and navigating poverty and racism “it was truly an experience i’ll never forget” stone says ahead of the recording stone met zephaniah outside the birmingham hippodrome where he was narrating the peaky blinders ballet “before the show we spoke at length about family music and the state of the world” recalls stone “he later drove us to the studio and recorded his verse in just a few takes the whole process was surreal and beautiful” the video to the track was produced months later “benjamin was actually quite unwell at the time” says stone “but he was determined to make the shoot we filmed his scene on a rooftop car park in birmingham’s chinatown” that was another day i’ll never forget” bomb the bass – empire with sinéad o’connor benjamin zephaniah

aka bomb the bass says “i remember smoking a lot of weed with sinéad while recording empire she sang the lead vocal in one take then added harmonies and backing vocals” simenon instinctively knew that zephaniah’s voice would contrast powerfully “he was such a warm open guy we spent a long day in the studio bouncing ideas around until we landed on the spacious delivery we recorded he gave the final

debating vegan food in china” reflecting on their final exchange slater said “benjamin had just received the album copies i sent and told me he played the track for his students i was humbled i miss him in this dimension but his words live on” he had intended to ask him to collaborate a second time “then a week later he was gone he left too soon his words always carried a message – not always comfortable never bland his delivery cut through class barriers and reached people from all walks of life” swayzak – illegal ft benjamin zephaniah 2000 the duo swayzak captured zephaniah’s rebellious spirit in this unapologetically anarchic track “working with benjamin was an unexpected delight” says james s taylor “there was no ego no pressure just good vibes” the collaboration quickly grew into a friendship “we talked deeply about politics and the british empire” david brown says “the brummie west indian poet – quite a person to have in one’s life” a 2024 “redraft” of zephaniah’s 1999 poem illegal was released under the title do something illegal as a tribute to zephaniah under brown’s ambient alias the eightsome reel the track ends with the sound of heavy rain recorded the day brown

A0598,2025-04-17,25,Some Pennsylvania Jews reminded of Tree of Life shooting after arson attack on Josh Shapiro’s home,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/joshshapiroarsonantisemitism-789c12954a3c91ae045f7778f934bb4f,harrisburg pa ap — a year ago carole zawatsky was invited by pennsylvania gov josh shapiro to a passover seder held in the same room at the governor’s official residence that was devastated by an arsonist just hours after shapiro hosted this year’s jewish holiday feast now as she looks at photos of the destruction zawatsky can envision where she had been seated and how deadly the attack could have been like many others zawatsky is cautiously awaiting word from investigators about the motivations of the attacker which are clouded by hints of erratic behavior as well as statements from his past still the attack hit the jewish community hard in a state where such pain is achingly familiar it targeted pennsylvania’s religiously observant jewish governor in the very place where just hours before he had hosted one of the central rituals of the jewish calendar zawatsky heads a pittsburgh organization formed to counter antisemitism and memorialize the victims of another pennsylvania assault – the murders of 11 worshippers from three congregations at the tree of life synagogue more than six years ago the deadliest antisemitic attack in us history “seeing those images is deeply traumatic” said zawatsky ceo of the tree of life the group established in the wake of the oct 27 2018 killings “it’s not too much to ask that we all live in a country where we celebrate our faith without fear” a murkier picture emerges on motive the synagogue shooting trial revealed that the gunman who was convicted and sentenced to death had long been steeped in antisemitism and methodically carried out the attack in the harrisburg case things are less clear investigators have released only fragments of what the suspect cody balmer of harrisburg told them his relatives say he has struggled with mental illness and his lawyers suggested wednesday that will be central to their defense “we have no definitive information about this person’s motive” zawatsky said “we do know that there was certainly hate involved” pennsylvania state police said the 38yearold balmer confessed to the attack harbored hatred for the governor and said he planned to beat shapiro with a hammer “balmer identified himself by name and related that governor josh shapiro needs to know that he ‘will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the palestinian people’” police wrote as part of applications for search warrants exactly who and what that meant were unclear in the documents senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york on thursday called on the justice department to determine whether the attack qualifies as a federal hate crime audrey glickman a survivor of the 2018 attack and a member of tree of life congregation said she admired shapiro’s composure just hours after the attack and his emphatic denunciation of hatred regardless of motivation “it takes a while to realize you’ve been attacked and what to make of it” glickman said she admired “how he stood up right away and spoke strongly about it” shapiro responded to the scene of the 2018 pittsburgh attack as pennsylvania’s thenattorney general as governor he took part in the 2024 groundbreaking for a new building to replace the synagogue including a memorial programming and other exhibits aimed to counter antisemitism reminders of an overheated political climate about 200 people participated in a somber march wednesday night in harrisburg they walked from the parking lot of a synagogue to the governor’s residence where they held a multifaith prayer vigil across the street several marchers connected the attack to the overheated political climate “to deny it is like putting your head in the sand” said retired presbyterian minister don potter 75 of dillsburg who said the images of the building’s interior with fire damage “made me sick” enid wassner a retired child care worker from hershey said the fact that the firebombing occurring during passover and targeted shapiro and his family was “extremely worrying” she noted that jewish institutions and buildings in harrisburg have had to increase security “gradually things have been getting more worrisome for me personally and the entire jewish community” questions emerge about attacker’s mental state police said in court affidavits that in an interview with detectives balmer “admitted to harboring hatred towards” shapiro and referred to the palestinian people in a 911 call attributed to him that was placed shortly after the breakin balmer’s mother and brother have said he suffered from bipolar disorder and would not consistently take medication his brother dan balmer said cody balmer twice in recent years spent time in a psychiatric hospital in harrisburg during a court hearing on monday balmer denied any history of mental illness dan balmer told the ap on tuesday that cody balmer “had these theories that were going on in his head” and became angry when family members would tell him his views didn’t reflect reality “the allegations if true demonstrate the devastating consequences of severe mental illness” mary klatt the chief public defender in dauphin county whose office is representing balmer said wednesday she said his preliminary hearing would be delayed to determine whether balmer is mentally competent to stand trial identity moves to forefront for shapiro shapiro declined to talk about the attacker’s motive on wednesday saying prosecutors will ultimately determine what drove him “it’s not for me to answer that” he said the governor has publicly criticized israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s government and the nature of israel’s military action in gaza but also has backed israel’s right to defend itself from hamas hank butler executive director of the pennsylvania jewish coalition said shapiro’s focus has been pennsylvania and not the palestinian people “to say that our governor wishes the worst on the palestinian people is not welcomed here” butler said “it is not justified absolutely not justified no attack is justified” shapiro has won statewide races three times in a crucial battleground state he was a finalist to be vice president kamala harris’s running mate in last year’s presidential campaign and is considered a potential 2028 democratic candidate for president the attack once again puts his identity front and center when harris picked minnesota gov tim walz over shapiro republicans tried to cast the pick as a snub to jewish voters rabbi rick jacobs president of the union for reform judaism an umbrella group for more than 800 reform congregations in north america connected the attack to shapiro’s identity “he’s also someone who is a strong supporter of israel” jacobs said of shapiro “are those things that put your life at risk in the 21st century” zawatsky the tree of life ceo noted that in the passover ritual jews are instructed not just to recite the story of their ancient forebears’ liberation from slavery but to envision themselves as having experienced it – something that feels especially poignant now whether law enforcement officials ultimately settle on a definitive conclusion about what motivated last weekend’s attack she and others already know what living in fear feels like “it’s very sad to think we pass along the inherited trauma of the fear of antisemitism but never did i think we would be a generation that would have the lived experience of this kind of violent antisemitism” she said associated press

united arab emirates ap — a us airstrike on an important oil port held by yemen’s houthi rebels killed more than 70 people and wounded many others the iranianbacked rebel group said friday marking a major escalation in the military campaign president donald trump launched against the faction last month the overnight strike on the ras isa port sent massive fireballs billowing skyward and turned tanker trucks into burning wrecks it was the first american attack on a houthicontrolled oil facility in the new us bombing campaign it also came just before the resumption of negotiations in rome between the us and iran over tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program which washington has linked to its attacks in yemen the us is targeting the houthis because of the group’s attacks on shipping in the red sea a crucial global trade route and on israel the houthis are the last militant group in iran’s selfdescribed “axis of resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking israel the port is a major hub for incoming fuel shipments that power areas of yemen held by the houthis and analysts say the airstrike could seriously affect daily life there the houthis who said the attack killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others aired graphic footage of the aftermath on their almasirah satellite news channel showing corpses strewn about the port and smashed tanker trucks they denounced

it said “this strike was not intended to harm the people of yemen” “us forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the iranbacked houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years” it said in its statement a us official said the attack sent a message to those supplying fuel to the houthis despite sanctions the official spoke to the associated press on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public hours after the us strike the houthis launched a missile toward israel that was intercepted the israeli military said sirens sounded in tel aviv and elsewhere meanwhile the houthis said they shot down another american mq9 predator drone which the us official acknowledged the port’s strategic significance the ras isa port is a collection of oil tanks and equipment that sits in yemen’s hodeida governorate along the red sea it is just off kamaran island which has been targeted by intense us airstrikes in recent days before the houthis took control of yemen’s capital sanaa in 2014 and sent the government into exile oil from the country’s energyrich marib governorate moved through ras isa for export but since the houthis don’t control that region the port now serves as an import hub for gasoline diesel and liquefied petroleum gas that help power those parts of yemen the houthis control a deadly escalation of trump’s yemen campaign the new us operation against the houthis under trump appears more extensive than attacks on the group were under president joe biden an ap review found the new campaign started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting “israeli” ships again over israel blocking aid from entering the gaza strip from november 2023 until this january the houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones sinking two of them and killing four sailors that has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the red sea corridor which typically sees 1 trillion of goods move through it the houthis also launched attacks targeting american warships without success assessing the toll of the monthold us airstrike campaign

campaign the actual cost in lives is hard to assess said luca nevola the senior analyst for yemen and the gulf at the armed conflict location event data project a think tank “since they are targeting civilian areas there’s a lot more victims but it’s also difficult to assess how many because the houthis are releasing these umbrella statements that cover all the victims or tend to stress only the civilian victims” nevola said further complicating the situation is the us strikes hitting military targets said mohammed albasha a yemen expert at the basha report risk advisory firm he pointed to an american attack that trump highlighted online with blackandwhite strike footage which might have killed about 70 fighters “although the houthis claimed it was a tribal gathering they neither released any footage nor named a single casualty strongly suggesting the victims were not civilians but affiliated fighters” albasha said “however the overnight strike on the ras isa fuel port marks the first masscasualty incident the houthis have openly acknowledged and publicized” the ap analyzed satellite images of the port provided by planet labs pbc that showed destroyed oil tanks and vehicles and

officials saying the company linked to the people’s liberation army has provided images allowing the rebels to target us warships and commercial vessels traveling through the red sea corridor bruce

A0608,2025-04-22,20,Pope Francis’ conservative critics had a unique way to oppose him: a retired pontiff,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-critics-fef5eb221e1a44a15fa7bb9aa83b9d73,vatican city ap — as amazonian bishops gathered at the vatican on oct 21 2019 a man entered a nearby church after dawn and stole three indigenous statues brought to rome for the occasion he threw them into the tiber river in a videotaped protest to denounce what he called the “pagan idolatry” taking place on pope francis’ watch the incident underscored the lengths to which pope francis’ traditionalist critics were willing to go to vent their opposition to history’s first latin american pope from individual protests to social media campaigns conferences and petitions conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority their token leaders in the college of cardinals will likely be maneuvering to ensure someone more sympathetic to their sensibilities will be elected to replace francis who died monday at 88 ‘some wanted me dead’ every pope has his critics and francis probably expected he would face opposition to his radical reform agenda after catholics for two generations grew used to more conservative popes “some wanted me dead” he quipped once after he heard some prelates in rome had started plotting a future conclave while he was in the hospital francis’ critics were unique in having a living alternate as a point of reference pope benedict xvi who resided as pope emeritus in the vatican gardens for the first decade of francis’ pontificate such an anomaly made the dynamics of the francis opposition a historical first it exacerbated divisions that experts say must be addressed before another pope decides to step down they say norms are necessary to prevent a retired pope from being an inspiration for the faithful in ways that discredit his successor or impact his leadership francis tolerated the rightwing opposition for a while often responding to their attacks with silence at times he even seemed to relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church “obsessed” with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus’ gospelmandated call to welcome the stranger feed the poor and show mercy to all “it’s an honor if the americans attack me” he once said referring to the usbased nexus of opposition after benedict’s death in 2022 francis tried to blunt the opposition and consolidate his progressive reforms even though it seemed the rightwing knives were out for him within days of benedict’s funeral his longtime secretary published a tellall memoir highly critical of francis it also emerged posthumously that cardinal george pell wrote a devastating memo that circulated anonymously calling francis’ pontificate a “catastrophe” while saying he welcomed criticism francis tried to neutralize the opposition through key appointments and targeted removals even while trying to make the church a welcoming “field hospital for wounded souls” especially lgbtq catholics after one gesture of outreach — francis approved blessings for samesex couples — african bishops united in disapproval in a remarkable continentwide dissent to a papal directive “if you look at all the history of the reform of the church where you have the strongest resistance or debated points it’s really usually a very important point” said sister nathalie becquart who helped spearhead one of francis’ progressive agenda items to make the church more responsive to the needs of laypeople wary of francis from the start conservative and traditionalist catholics were wary of francis after their beloved benedict became the first pope in 600 years to resign they grimaced when francis emerged on the loggia of st peter’s basilica after his 2013 election without the erminerimmed red velvet cape of his predecessors they gasped a few weeks later when he washed the feet of women and muslims on holy thursday a ritual previously restricted to men “we don’t like this pope” headlined italy’s conservative daily il foglio a few months into his papacy “the dictator pope” was the title of book by a british traditionalist published a few years later over time the critics’ worst fears came true one breaking point came in 2016 when francis opened the door to letting divorced and civilly remarried catholics receive communion some accused francis of heresy four conservative cardinals formally asked him to clarify himself issuing “dubia” or questions to him they argued church doctrine held that catholics who remarried without a church annulment were living in sin and couldn’t receive the sacraments he never replied reversing benedict on the latin mass conservatives could not have known that francis would take one of the most controversial steps of his pontificate by reimposing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass that benedict had relaxed the reversal of benedict’s signature liturgical legacy was evidence that francis had essentially declared war on traditionalists the ancient liturgy and benedict’s papacy itself “francis hates us francis hates tradition francis hates all that is good and beautiful” the traditionalist blog rorate caeli tweeted but it concluded “francis will die the latin mass will live forever” francis insisted his aim was to preserve church unity critics accused him of the opposite of driving a wedge and the outrage wasn’t limited to usbased conservative catholic media or fringe rightwing bloggers who had popularized francisbashing cardinal raymond burke one of the “dubia” prelates whom francis sacked early on as the vatican’s supreme court justice blasted the “severity” of the papal crackdown guinean cardinal robert sarah the vatican’s retired liturgy chief responded with tweets quoting benedict’s original 2007 law to relax the restrictions that francis had overturned they were accompanied by a photo of benedict wearing the red cape that francis had eschewed the night of his election a year earlier sarah orchestrated a media firestorm by persuading benedict to coauthor a book reaffirming priestly celibacy at a time when francis was considering ordaining married men to address a clergy shortage in the amazon the book and the prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one created the nightmare scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of in 2013 when benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement and call himself “emeritus pope” rather than revert to his birth name the scandal died down after benedict removed himself as a coauthor and francis fired his secretary archbishop georg gaenswein believed to have been behind it after benedict died and gaenswein penned his highly critical tellall memoir “nothing but the truth” francis exiled him from the vatican then after a time in his native germany made him an ambassador after burke joined a bigger group of cardinals questioning francis’ 2023 synod on the church’s future francis cut him off financially francis was more tolerant with another critic the retired archbishop of hong kong cardinal joseph zen he excoriated the pope for agreeing in 2018 to a deal with china over the nomination of bishops accusing francis of selling out china’s underground catholics who stayed loyal to the holy see during decades of persecution francis received zen at the vatican and later called him a “tender soul” francis won few friends with his frequent denunciations of “clericalism” — the idea that priests should be put on a pedestal he made it a tradition to use his christmas greeting to publicly shame vatican bureaucrats accusing them of being careerist moneygrubbing gossips with “spiritual alzheimer’s” german cardinal gerhard mueller complained that francis treated vatican monsignors like “uneducated children” a major us critic emerges francis’ biggest conservative critic was the vatican’s former ambassador to the us archbishop carlo maria vigano in 2018 he said francis had covered up accusations that thencardinal theodore mccarrick an american had slept with his seminarians vigano demanded francis resign for allegedly rehabilitating mccarrick from sanctions imposed by benedict the furor faded after francis defrocked mccarrick and vigano was discredited with conspiracy theories about covid19 mccarrick died earlier this month in 2024 francis excommunicated vigano after finding him guilty of schism papal biographer austen ivereigh said francis dismantled much of the resistance he lists the amazonian synod as a defining positive moment of his pontificate not because of the incident with the statues but because the meeting emphasized his key pastoral priority of accompanying the faithful “the native peoples of amazonia were right here in st peter’s square and francis walked across to the synod with them” ivereigh said recalling the feathered headdresses and indigenous statues that were on display “the pastor among his people walking together and i

A0610,2025-04-24,18,Freed Israeli hostage feared the ‘many ways to die’ in Gaza but kept hope alive,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/hostages-israel-gaza-6eb99b5152f42b94f8bfb50bee96af02,tel aviv israel ap — whether the threat was abusive hamas guards hunger illness or israeli strikes there were moments during tal shoham’s 505 days of captivity in gaza when he didn’t think he’d be alive the next morning there were “many times that i separated from life and tried to accept death” the 40yearold israeli who also holds austrian citizenship told the associated press “there are so many ways to die there” shoham was one of dozens of hostages released from gaza in february as part of a ceasefire agreement between hamas and israel that has since been broken his wife two children and three other family members were also kidnapped on oct 7 2023 and were freed a month later shoham said he spent half his captivity in apartments and the rest in underground tunnels he was sometimes bound starved beaten and threatened with death and initially didn’t know if his family was alive after his wife was released shoham said someone identifying himself as a member of hamas called to warn her not to talk about what she’d been through or they’d kill her husband so as he recounted his own experience shoham said there were details he wouldn’t discuss fearful of endangering remaining hostages with ceasefire talks at a standstill israel is vowing to advance deeper into gaza until hamas releases the 59 hostages still there more than half of whom are believed dead the resumption of fighting has inflamed debate in israel over the course of the war and the hostages’ fate israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has come under mounting domestic pressure for his handling of the hostage crisis but he also faces demands from his hardline allies not to accept any deal that falls short of hamas’ destruction the abduction shoham was kidnapped while visiting relatives in kibbutz be’eri when hamas attacked he and his family hid in a safe room meant to offer protection from incoming rockets but as militants pried open a window and used explosives to try to break in the family surrendered a decision shoham credits with saving their lives shoham was thrown into the back of a vehicle and taken into gaza not knowing what happened to his wife or children be’eri was among the hardesthit communities that day before being separated shoham recalled telling his now 9yearold son that he didn’t know if they were going to die “i didn’t want him to hear a lie from me if it’s the last minutes of our life” he said upon entering gaza a militant jumped on the car’s roof pointed his gun at shoham and told him to kneel but shoham refused not wanting to be killed on their terms he said he said the militant had “murder in his eyes” the apartments shoham was first taken to an apartment that his captors said was in northern gaza he spent weeks there handcuffed and confined to a room about a month later he was moved to another apartment and joined by evyatar david and guy gilboadalal hostages he would spend most of his captivity with the two men were abducted from a music festival in southern israel where at least 364 people were killed and dozens more taken hostage hearing about the conditions of their captivity made shoham feel lucky about his own they’d been kept in more uncomfortable ziptie handcuffs with plastic bags on their heads he said and fed one pita per day the three lived in that apartment for months where they endured daily beatings guards would taunt and humiliate them asking how the music festival was and making shooting noises shoham said forbidden by their captors from speaking they got to know each other through furtive whispers to humanize himself in the eyes of his captors and hopefully make them less likely to kill him shoham learned arabic and talked with them about his life in israel one of their guards liked massages shoham said so the captives provided daily back rubs in exchange for more variety in their diet like tuna sardines and even eggs shoham learned his wife and children were alive about 50 days into his captivity in what he considered an act of kindness his captors gave him a letter written by his wife that said she and their children were ok and would be released soon he credits that gesture by the guards with giving him more mental strength to focus on his own survival the tunnel last june shoham david and gilboadalal were relocated to a tunnel that they estimated to be about 30 meters 98 feet underground shoham said they were moved after israel rescued four hostages from apartments in gaza earlier that month an operation that killed more than 270 palestinians they were transported in an ambulance shoham said cleanly shaved dressed in clothes meant to make him blend in and blindfolded hamas operates from civilian areas including hospitals and israel accuses hamas militants of taking cover in ambulances and other emergency vehicles the tunnels were dark and damp and it was hard to breathe shoham said the three men were kept with another hostage omer wenkert who had been in the tunnels for much longer they shared a 12meterlong 39footlong cell and slept on mattresses on the ground a meter away from a hole that was their toilet they showered roughly every 21 days shoham lost about 60 pounds 28 kilograms while in captivity he developed a leg infection that was so bad he couldn’t walk for weeks after a doctor visited and provided vitamins he said his health improved what also helped shoham survive he said was focusing on what he could control he started doing mindfulness activities he had learned from his wife a psychologist and discussed his feelings with the other hostages “the only thing that i have power upon is my inner life” he said he told himself each day that he’d eventually be free back home and healing shoham and wenkert were freed together in the last release of living hostages before the ceasefire ended the last thing shoham told david and gilboadalal was to be strong and not lose hope hamas later released a video showing the two men sitting in a nearby vehicle distressed as they were forced to watch the handover for released hostages that day a group representing hostages’ families called the video “sickening” shoham worries they’re running out of time and is urging the government and the international community not to tie the hostages’ fate to a ceasefire or a peace agreement “i really fear that if they won’t be released soon they probably will die there” he said shoham says his own healing process has been made easier by knowing his family can relate to what he endured and his freedom has helped the family properly mourn those killed on oct 7 including his wife’s father while he was in captivity they’d been so focused on his release he said since returning home shoham has gained 35 pounds 16 kilograms saying he wanted to eat everything and never felt full lately he’s been trying to get back to his precaptivity routine of intermittent fasting while his leg is still not fully healed shoham says he’s one of the lucky ones in that he’s not suffering from nightmares he credits his children with helping him keep moving forward “when i can hear my children addressing us like mother and father mom and dad saying both names

any context which is the appearance of jd vance vance a catholic convert was granted a brief audience with the pope on easter sunday after what people magazine described as his “brushing off” by the pontiff the day before after vance’s departure the pope delivered his easter address via an aide which included the line “how much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable the marginalised and migrants” – surely a onestar yelp review directed at the us vicepresident now we must wait for the funeral on saturday followed by the puff of white smoke to indicate the election of a new pope a reminder that the catholic church never shortchanges on theatrics among the handful of lead contenders we are of course feverishly hoping for success for the candidate with the name

A0623,2025-04-28,14,Andreeva and Gauff advance before Spain power outage halts play,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/p/x25q4t,mirra andreeva has spent the past two years of her life establishing herself as one of the most successful teenagers of her era yet on a chaotic surreal day in madrid the 17 yearold had to briefly work through playing conditions more familiar to her contemporaries on the junior circuit during the final change of ends of her fourthround match against the ukrainian qualifier yulia starodubtseva as she served for a comfortable victory she learned of the power outage that had ravaged spain portugal and many nearby countries ultimately forcing play to be postponed in madrid as matches across the tournament grounds had already come to a halt the two players were told that they could play out the subsequent game but there was a catch the live electronic line‑calling system was no longer functioning and there were no line umpires to call upon they would have to play as if they were juniors again calling their own lines with only the umpire there to intervene naturally andreeva began to feel the pressure “it was 1540 on my serve and i was like ‘oh mirra just please please do everything in your power to just take this game and finish this match’” she said laughing “i knew that if it would go to 55 probably we would have to wait probably i would not be here yet and i would just be waiting and we would just see what we would do” from double break point down andreeva pulled herself together and closed out the match a few metres away on the neighbouring stadium court her next opponent was also one of the fortunate players coco gauff had been in the middle of her post‑match interview after a dominant win when the power shut down gauff noted she had actually requested to be scheduled as the second match on‑court for once she was thankful to the wta supervisers for not honouring that request “so far the toughest thing has been not been able to shower after my match there’s no running water so i just had to take baby wipes and wipe myself spray some perfume and call it a day” gauff said an hour after her match “i don’t even think we’ll be able to go back to the hotel as the traffic lights are out so it’s just crazy how much we depend on electricity it’s really insane it puts that in perspective and also makes me think about the humans that lived before electricity and how impressive that is” 124 major power outage causes chaos in spain and portugal – video report other players were not quite as fortunate grigor dimitrov the 15th seed held a match point against britain’s jacob fearnley at 64 52 before serving for the match a game later by 54 the second set back on serve both players were walking off the court an hour later dimitrov could be found sitting down alone in the sun in a quiet outdoor spot players use to warm up smiling to himself at such an surreal turn of events “at this point this is only a situation that you can just laugh at if i was oncourt because it’s probably not going to happen ever again” gauff said “you can always remember the day the power went out at the madrid open” as much of madrid came to a standstill that chaos was reflected inside the caja mágica unlike many other tournament sites the madrid open grounds are mostly indoors below ground level and there is minimal natural light off the court it meant that much of the grounds were plunged in total darkness in the communal fan areas spectators stood shoulder to shoulder packed like sardines relying solely on the lights from their phones view image in fullscreen bulgaria’s grigor dimitrov had his match with britain’s jacob fearnley interrupted photograph thomas coexafpgetty images the players themselves had things slightly better shortly after the outage workers swept in with candles with the players’ restaurant and lounge eventually illuminated by dozens of candles every hour the player warmup area seemed to take on a completely different function shortly after the power cut a number of players due oncourt had been warming up in total darkness an hour later the room was filled with players simply lying on the floor on the phone and talking with others eventually as they admitted defeat numerous massage tables appeared and the players ended their days with physiotherapy “i was in the gym and it’s super dark everyone is using the phones with flashlights but it’s also kind of fun because everyone is talking to each other and the atmosphere is a little more friendly” andreeva said it soon became clear that there would be no more play on this unforgettable day as players scrambled to secure a lift home the line at the transport desk extended almost as long as the wimbledon queue their requests were recorded with pen and paper with traffic lights ceasing to function in the city a threehour journey awaited for those who secured a car many opted for the one‑ to two‑hour walk once they reached home this time they would not be able to distract themselves by playing video games watching tv series or doomscrolling on social media not everyone seemed to mind “if you take my phone away i’m completely fine spending time without it” said andreeva who turns 18 on tuesday “the only thing i need in my phone right now is a flashlight”,,,,,,,,Recent

the nfl draft was the dominant story of the weekend with one of college football’s most highprofile players lasting until the fifth round the fact sanders was taken by the browns two rounds after they drafted another quarterback in dillon gabriel made the entire situation even more rare the browns were the first team to draft two quarterbacks in the first five rounds of the nfl draft since washington did it in 2012 when the team traded up to take robert griffin iii with the secondoverall pick and then drafted kirk cousins in the fourth round there are only a handful of other times in the common draft era beginning in 1967 that a team picked two quarterbacks that high in the draft green bay drafted anthony dilweg in the third round and jeff graham in the fourth in 1989 the packers traded graham to washington later in the draft and he never played a game in the nfl despite spending time with several teams dilweg started seven games in 1990 the colts doubledipped at quarterback in 1982 taking art schlichter fourth overall and mike pagel in the fourth round schlichter played only 13 games because of gambling problems while pagel had a long career mostly as a backup the houston oilers also did it in 1971 taking dan pastorini in the first round and lynn dickey in the third both had long careers as starters in the nfl there were two other times it happened but one of those qbs quickly shifted positions to receiver once joining the nfl the jets took kellen clemens in the second round and brad smith in the fourth in 2006 clemens spent 12 seasons in the nfl mostly as a backup while smith had a successful career as a receiver returner and occasional wildcat quarterback the raiders took quarterbacks with their first two picks in 1968 but firstrounder eldrige dickey moved to receiver following his first training camp and had only five catches in his career secondrounder ken stabler went on to become the 1974 ap nfl mvp and had a hall of fame career as a quarterback trading up trading up for a toptwo pick in the nfl draft isn’t that uncommon with it happening five times in the last 13 drafts before this season doing it for a nonquarterback was rare the deal made by jacksonville with cleveland to move up from no 5 to no 2 to take travis hunter marked the first time since 1997 that a team traded up that high to draft a nonquarterback it happened twice in 1997 with the raiders trading up to no 2 that year before the rams jumped them two weeks later to trade for the no 1 pick the rams took hall of famer orlando pace and the raiders drafted darrell russell there hadn’t been a receiver taken in the top two since calvin johnson went second to detroit in 2007 and no defensive back had been taken that high since safety eric turner went second to cleveland in 1991 there were 12 other instances in the common draft era starting in 1967 when a team traded up for a toptwo pick and drafted a nonquarterback pace was one of four hall of famers acquired that way with the other three all being running backs eric dickerson 1983 earl campbell 1978 and tony dorsett 1977 some of the other trades weren’t as successful like cincinnati moving up to take running back kijana carter first in 1995 the jets trading up for receiver lam jones in 1980 and the vikings moving up for running back clint jones in 1967 ohio state and sec top the draft lists with the sec setting a record with 79 players drafted and ohio state having 14 of the 71 draft picks in the big ten the two most prominent college football conferences dominated draft weekend thanks to the first year of expansion that sent texas and oklahoma to the sec along with usc ucla oregon and washington joining the big ten those conferences accounted for 58 of all draft picks throw in the 42 picks for the acc and 31 for the big 12 and the four power conferences had nearly 87 of all draft picks this year along with six more from notre dame the group of five had just 18 players drafted as many players who began their careers at that level have moved up to power conferences there were only eight players chosen from nonfbs teams there were players who finished their college careers at 86 schools that got drafted with the defending champion buckeyes leading the way with 14 — one off of the record since the start of the sevenround draft era in 1994 set by georgia in 2022 the bulldogs were next with 13 followed texas with 12 oregon with 10 and ole miss with eight five schools had seven players drafted alabama florida lsu miami and michigan this marked the 87th straight draft with a player from michigan being taken usc also has had a player taken in every draft since 1939 tying the wolverines for the longest active streak position breakdown there was an even split of offensive and defensive players picked in the draft with 126 players from each side of the ball picked — not including the twoway player hunter the other four players taken were specialists including a rare long snapper drafted with julian ashby getting taken by new england with the 252nd pick the defensive line led the way with 58 players taken according to sportradar followed by 47 exclusive defensive backs and 41 offensive linemen there were 30 receivers drafted in addition to hunter along with 25 running backs 21 linebackers 16 tight ends and 14 qbs this marked just the fourth time in the common draft era that two tight ends were taken in they top 15 with chicago taking colston loveland 10th and indianapolis choosing tyler warren 14th it also happened in 1992 derek brown and johnny

than its predecessor and offers a level of allinone convenience that makes the satellitefree pay tv one of the best on the market the guardian’s journalism is independent we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link learn more sky glass gen 2 is a straight replacement for the original model from 2021 which introduced sky’s tvoverbroadband service that ditched the need for a satellite dish the new tv comes in three sizes and you can buy the smallest 43in version for a oneoff payment of £699 or £14 a month spread over four years after which you own it it requires a sky subscription for full use costing from £15 a month for the sky essential tv pack you wouldn’t buy a glass without the intention of using sky but should you want to ditch the subscription at a later date it will function as a basic smart tv with access to streaming apps such as bbc iplayer plus a basic aerial and multiple hdmi inputs view image in fullscreen the gen 2 is available in a choice of three colours and comes with a colourmatched remote photograph sky uk from the front the gen 2 model looks very similar to the original it has the same monolithic design with an aluminium body slim bezels a soundbar hidden behind a colourmatched mesh at the bottom and voice control mics that respond to “hello sky” glass gen 2 is thinner and lighter than the outgoing model though still heavy for a modern tv weighing 147kg for the 43in version with the stand the larger and heavier 55in and 65in models will require two people to safely manoeuvre them a redesigned stand makes it a lot easier to set up even at the 65in size as tested with the tv simply slotting on to two prongs for a very stable mount without screws or tools required it needs a power cable and wifi or ethernet for internet a wall bracket can be bought separately view image in fullscreen the tv is voice and motionactivated turning on and off when it detects presence and displaying fullscreen recommendations for the latest shows and films photograph samuel gibbsthe guardian the crisp 4k lcd screen is noticeably brighter than its predecessor with deeper blacks and muchreduced halo or blooming effect which is the unwanted glow around the edges of bright spots such as white text on a black background the screen has automatic brightness adjustment which made things look a little too dark and grey in all but the brightest of rooms turning it off improved things sky has automatic picture optimisation modes that detect the content being watched such as entertainment sport and movies plus manual vivid and extra vivid modes for those who like overthetop colours i found the entertainment mode made the picture too warm with people looking a little orange while sport was a bit grey for all but the brightest of match days i preferred the movie setting which is much more balanced but there is also a custom mode for those who want to fully personalise the picture the improved screen really comes to life with hdr films shows and sport the premier league looks crisp and vibrant on sky and tnt while flicks such as furiosa a mad max saga in dolby vision look particularly good but the screen is not ideal for gaming with an xbox or ps5 lacking the variable refresh rates of up to 120hz that console gaming greatly benefits from big sound and great vocals view image in fullscreen the speakers fire out from the grille at the top of the tv and fabric strip below the screen photograph samuel gibbsthe guardian a big advantage of the glass over normal tvs is the integrated sevenspeaker soundbar which blows other tv speakers away for power and clarity vocals are particularly clear at almost any volume and with none of the lipsync issues that can plague external soundbars without a separate subwoofer or rear speakers it does an admirable job of producing big and full sound however it struggles to produce really deep booming bass and while it has a nice wide sound there isn’t much in the way of virtual surround effect both require a more complex system to achieve with more speakers the tv also has night sound speech enhancement and bass boost modes the first of which proved very useful to avoid waking the rest of the house for latenight movies by dampening loud noises while keeping the dialogue intelligible muchimproved sky over broadband view image in fullscreen you need a minimum of 25mbps for hd or 30mbps for uhd broadcast but don’t have to have sky’s broadband for it to work photograph samuel gibbsthe guardian since the original glass’s launch in 2021 the sky os service powering it has dramatically improved it still has excellent search and an improved playlist function with more than one user profile so everyone in the house can have their own lists and recommendations including child profiles the playlist feature automatically keeps track of new episodes of shows and films you want to watch regardless of which service they’re available from it feeds into a recently added “continue watching” rail that helps you jump straight back into the content you were previously watching which is all i needed about 75 of the time watching pausing and rewinding live tv works great recent reductions to the broadcast delay for sports have made a meaningful difference preventing the irritating scenario where a friend watching on satellite or aerial a little ahead of you texts to brag about a goal before you’ve managed to actually see it ondemand content from the sky platform works really well but a bigger improvement is in the thirdparty ondemand services such as bbc iplayer itv x and channel 4 on which you are reliant in place of recordings it’s still not quite as fast and seamless as having local recordings such as you might on sky q or other pvr but most of the apps launch quicker work better and will take you straight to the episode you want to watch from the playlist or search page it supports most of the major ondemand services including my5 youtube prime video disney paramount apple tv and discovery for all your content in one place view image in fullscreen voice control works well through the button on the remote but the tv’s wake word is a little temperamental working properly or understanding me about 60 of the time photograph samuel gibbsthe guardian sustainability the television is repairable apart from the screen

work when it launched to the television screen and the sky streaming service powering it the gen 2 model rights many of the wrongs of its predecessor it is brighter faster has higher contrast and handles highlights far better it is also easily the bestsounding tv available it competes fairly well in the midrange market but you can certainly buy a betterlooking screen for similar money without a soundbar those looking for the absolute best picture should look elsewhere the sky os service has greatly improved to a level that rivals the best in the business live broadcast works just as it might over satellite or aerial ondemand content from the sky platform is as good as local recordings while the thirdparty apps such as bbc iplayer and itvx have levelled up to at least an acceptable standard the playlist and search with support for all the major streaming services are the killer features removing the burden of remembering which of the plethora of services hosts the content you want to watch above all it is the level of convenience offered by the glass gen 2 of an allin one solution with solid sound and a single remote for all your tv needs that is the major appeal pros allinone streaming and pay tv device great sound no satellitecable or aerial needed good remote excellent search and playlist functions improved apps improved picture and good hdr custom picture modes

with ukraine or face increased sanctions but has proposed holding direct negotiations with kyiv this week the leaders of britain france germany and poland told the russian president either to sign up to an unconditional ceasefire by monday or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers to ukraine “all of us here together with the us are calling putin out if he’s serious about peace then he has a chance to show it now” said uk prime minister keir starmer at a joint press conference of the five leaders in kyiv starmer said the leaders were demanding “an unconditional ceasefire rejecting putin’s conditions and are clear that if he turns his back on peace we will respond working with president trump with all our partners we will ramp up sanctions and increase our military aid for ukraine’s defence to pressure russia back to the table” 053 european leaders call for unconditional 30day ceasefire in ukraine – video starmer emmanuel macron and friedrich merz arrived in the ukrainian capital on the same train on saturday morning while donald tusk travelled on a separate train the leaders met zelenskyy for talks in central kyiv it is macron’s first visit to kyiv since summer 2022 and the first visit for merz as chancellor having only taken office this week “all five leaders had a fruitful call with potus focused on peace efforts” ukraine’s foreign minister andrii sybiha wrote on x adding a picture of the five men gathered around a mobile phone on speaker mode sybiha added “ukraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land air and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on monday if russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured a durable ceasefire and confidencebuilding measures can pave the way to peace negotiations” russia’s response to the ultimatum came in a press briefing for russian media and western television networks held in the kremlin close to 2am local time on sunday morning putin rejected the calls for a ceasefire but said he was ready for direct negotiations with ukraine he suggested delegations from the two countries could meet in istanbul this thursday to begin talks “we don’t exclude that during these negotiations we will be able to agree on new ceasefires” putin said macron said on sunday that putin’s talks proposal was “a first step but not enough” “an unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations” the french president said adding that the russian leader was “looking for a way out but he still wants to buy time” ukraine and european capitals have previously demanded a full ceasefire as a precondition to starting negotiations putin left the briefing for which journalists had been kept waiting for up to seven hours without answering any questions there was no immediate readout from the white house on the call or on whether trump had made specific commitments if putin rejects the ceasefire trump and the us administration have said a 30day ceasefire could be the first step on the way to a sustainable peace deal ukraine has said it is ready to implement such a ceasefire but russia has so far refused saying it would only do so if all western weapons deliveries to ukraine were halted view image in fullscreen volodymyr zelenskyy emmanuel macron and keir starmer in kyiv ukraine photograph thomas peterreuters in an early sign that russia may not be

against russia … you think that’s smart eh shove these peace plans up your pangender arses” instead moscow unilaterally declared a threeday ceasefire beginning on 8 may which kyiv said was designed to avoid ukrainian drone attacks on russia during celebrations of 80 years of the soviet victory in the second world war held in moscow on friday thousands of troops marched through red square for the annual victory day parade with numerous world leaders in attendance most notably china’s xi jinping and the brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva robert fico and aleksandar vučić the prime minister of eu member slovakia and the president of eu hopeful serbia respectively also attended the parade drawing irritation from other european leaders fighting has continued along the frontlines during the supposed ceasefire both sides have said but russia has largely refrained from drone and missile attacks on ukraine “putin didn’t need conditions when he wanted a ceasefire to have a parade and he doesn’t need them now ukraine has shown the willingness to engage again and again but again and again putin has refused” said starmer starmer said putin had drawn the wrong lessons from the second world war “we understand the lessons of history the lesson that any veteran of normandy or north africa or of any other campaign will tell you but that putin has not yet grasped there is no glory in aggression and conquest glory comes from fighting for your country defending the people and winning the peace” he said view image in fullscreen lr friedrich merz emmanuel macron volodymyr

thousands of flags have been erected in the central square to remember those killed in the war with russia the leaders paid their respects and had a moment of silence before heading to the talks with zelenskyy the five then had a virtual meeting with other leaders on progress being made for a socalled “air land maritime and regeneration force” that is planned to be part of a peace deal trump has yet to comment publicly on his conversation with the group of leaders on friday he was asked by reporters in the oval office if he had a message for putin “i have a message for both parties get this war ended” he said adding “get this stupid war finished that’s my message for both of them” the trump administration has so far appeared to be much tougher on kyiv than moscow but there are some small signals that the mood in washington might be changing after a positive meeting between trump and zelenskyy in the vatican on the sidelines of the pope’s funeral even the vicepresident jd vance seen as the most sceptical of voices on support for ukraine has criticised moscow’s stance in recent days “right now the russians are asking for a certain set of requirements a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict we think they’re asking for too much” he said this week the us embassy in kyiv put out a public warning late on friday night that it had received intelligence of a “potentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days” it did not give further details but it later emerged that russia will close its airspace over the kapustin

minutes ago share save sam francis political reporter share save getty images sir keir starmer has promised to overhaul a broken immigration system with plans to tighten english tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependents among the reforms being considered migrants will also have to wait 10 years to apply to settle in the uk instead of automatically gaining settled status after five years under the plans labours longawaited migration rules to be published on monday will create a system that is controlled selective and fair the prime minister said shadow home secretary chris philp said the idea sir keir is tough on immigration is a joke and promised to push parliament to introduce cap on migration labour have signalled the plan to raise english language requirements across every immigration route into the uk though have not set out full details for the first time adult dependents will also be required to show basic language skills to help them integrate find jobs and avoid exploitation the bbc has been told the changes are likely to require a change to primary legislation delaying implementation until the next parliamentary session in 2026 in a statement ahead of his speech on monday sir keir said when people come to our country they should also commit to integration and to learning our language critics have warned the rules may split families if partners or parents struggle to learn english but research suggests that migrants themselves consider language important in 2021 nineoutoften migrants reported speaking english well according to analysis by the oxford university migration observatory only 1 of migrants selfreported not being able to speak english at all but those with poor english skills were much less likely to be employed the analysis found the move is part of a wider effort to tighten up what the prime minister called a broken immigration system the changes will also end automatic settlement in the uk after five years most migrants will need to stay at least ten years before they can apply for settle status and begin the path to gaining full citizenship at the same time a fasttrack settlement will be established for nurses engineers ai experts and others who genuinely contribute to britains growth and society sir keir said a tenyear route to settlement would make the uk more restrictive than most other highincome countries madeleine sumption director of the migration observatory at the university of oxford told bbc news the main impact of the change will be more visafee revenue to the home office because people on temporary visas pay ongoing fees to be here ms sumption said a longer settlement process will also make it harder for migrants to settle in because more will lack the rights that come with permanent status she added but sir keir described the plans as a clean break from the past that will ensure settlement in this country is a privilege that must be earned not a right successive governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration which is the number of people coming to the uk minus the number leaving net migration climbed to a record 906000 in june 2023 and last year it stood at 728000 the immigration white paper brings together months of research by officials and will lay out labours plan to get tougher on migration in the wake of big gains made by reform uk in the local elections the threshold for skilled worker visas is expected to be increased to graduate level tightened from the current alevel measure while the list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries will be narrowed home secretary yvette cooper revealed on sunday that labour will change the rules to ensure care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas instead firms will be required to hire british nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country cooper told bbc ones sunday with laura kuenssberg it is time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad these two changes will cut up to 50000 lowerskilled and care workers coming to the uk over the next year cooper said the liberal democrats said the immigration system was in tatters and trust had been shattered labour must now focus on fixing our broken immigration system and the liberal democrats look forward to scrutinising the governments plans to ensure a system that works for our economy and our country home affairs spokeswoman lisa smart said the conservative party said that while it agrees with the plan to end care worker recruitment from abroad it would force a vote on a binding migration cap but starmer and labour will vote it down chris philp predicted he called labours plans too little and argued that if the government had stuck with tory changes net migration would have dropped by about 400000 reform uks deputy leader richard tice said that his partys strong performance in the local elections in england was due to public anger about

settler while filming in west bank 41 minutes ago share save fergal keane alice doyard bbc news reporting from jordan valley share save bbc dust was rising on the track it hung in the hot midday air as the white jeep came towards us the driver was less than a minute away i think its moshe sharvit said gil alexander 72 a devout religious jew who tries to protect palestinian shepherds from intimidation by jewish settlers over the last year weve been documenting his work with shepherds in the northern jordan valley in the israelioccupied west bank the man approaching us was placed under sanctions by britain and the eu last year after they said he had used physical aggression threatened families at gunpoint and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace palestinian communities in a case reported by our colleagues at bbc eye investigates last year a palestinian grandmother alleged that moshe sharvit had forced her to leave her family home in october 2023 ayesha shtayyeh also said he pointed a gun at her head and threatened to kill her weve been here for 50 years…what have i ever done to him she asked when bbc eye interviewed her she said her familys troubles began after moshe sharvit established a socalled outpost a settlement that is illegal under both israeli and international law chasing away the familys sheep damaging property and constantly threatening them the alleged incident with the gun was the final straw moshe sharvit did not respond to bbc eyes requests for a response to ayeshas account back on the mountainside the man accused of this violence stopped his car and approached us nodding towards gil alexander he asked us do you know hes a very dangerous guy when our translator explained to moshe sharvit we were from the bbc he said ah the bbc… great lovers of israel… he went on to call us bad and dangerous people addressing our translator he said so do you understand that theyre the people who are most dangerous to the state of israel then he phoned the police asking them to come to the scene when he wasnt calling the police he filmed us filming him moshe sharvit and gil alexander represent starkly different visions of israels future moshe sharvit believes all of the west bank which settlers and the israeli government call judea and samaria were given by god to the jews in this he is supported by senior ministers in the government including the minister of finance bezalel smotrich and the minister of public security itamar bengvir both men are settlers and leaders of farright ultranationalist parties ayesha shtayyeh alleges moshe sharvit threatened her with a gun and told her to leave her home of 50 years smotrich has said gaza will be totally destroyed and that its people will be totally despairing understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in gaza and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places the other places he envisages are foreign countries bengvir who is responsible for the police has convictions for inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organisation israels prime minister benjamin netanyahu relies on the support of the farright settler movement to keep his government in power he criticised the sanctions imposed on moshe sharvit and other settlers saying his government viewed the move with great severity us sanctions against moshe sharvit were dropped when president donald trump came to power the uns top court ruled last year that israels occupation of the palestinian territories is against international law and that all settlement activity is illegal israel rejects this and argues that settlements are necessary for security citing lethal attacks by palestinian gunmen on settlers such as the killing of three people last january in the west bank gil alexander left and moshe sharvit both phoned the police settlement expansion is anathema to gil alexander he considers himself a zionist but within the existing borders of israel these are the frontiers that existed before it seized the west bank in the 1967 middle east war after neighbouring arab countries launched a surprise attack he is part of a network called the jordan valley activists – moshe sharvit calls them anarchists offering solidarity and working for peaceful coexistence with the palestinians what they the settlers want to see happen gil alexander told us is that it will be an area completely free of arabs it isnt moshe its all the people above him who sent him here meaning from the top moshe sharvits desire to have the jordan valley empty of palestinians is shared by the leader of the regional council a governmentsupported body david elhayani who has visited the sanctioned settler in his air conditioned office about 15km 9 miles from moshe sharvits settler outpost he told us the notion of settler violence is an invention of the anarchist extreme left meant to harm the settlement image as for the future of the palestinians he was emphatic they should go to neighbouring jordan this country needs to be free of arabs its the only way its a global interest why global because the minute there wont be arabs here it will be a jewish nation for the jews who wont have to hurt each other there wont be conflict there wont be anything gil alexander who describes himself as a zionist believes israeli territory should end at the 1967 borders gil alexander and moshe sharvit have a history of antagonism during an altercation on a palestinian farmers land in january 2023 moshe sharvit says gil alexander tried to seize his firearm from its holster while speaking to our translator he produced a video of the incident on his phone you can see gil alexander same hat and glasses thats me here you see he grabs my gun gil alexander says he was acting in selfdefence after moshe sharvit had grabbed his walking stick and the phone of his friend and violently pushing it he says he feared moshe sharvit was going to use the weapon as a result moshe sharvit got a restraining order which forbids gil alexander from being within 25km 15 miles of his farm the police have charged gil alexander with illegal possession of a weapon the one he allegedly tried to take from moshe sharvit and assault the issue will be considered by the israeli courts moshe sharvit himself is the subject of a restraining order forbidding him to approach a palestinian family living near his outpost for six months since march this year during our encounter the settler claimed that gil alexander had breached his restraining order by taking us to the high ground overlooking the valley the peace activist told us later that he had mistakenly strayed just over half a kilometre inside the area of the order although moshe sharvits settlement is illegal even under israeli law it has not been removed human rights organisations and numerous eyewitnesses testify that the israeli army and police frequently stand by while settlers attack palestinian villages the violence has escalated sharply since the 7 october 2023 hamas attack on israel in which about 1200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped and which triggered the gaza war moshe sharvit approached blocked the road and phoned the police according to a report issued by the un office for humanitarian affairs there were 1804 attacks by settlers against palestinians in the period january 2024 to march 2025 the israeli human rights group yesh din there is law reported that only 3 of complaints made against settlers resulted in a conviction in six days last month from 22 to 28 april the un recorded 14 incidents involving settlers that left 36 palestinians injured in the tense atmosphere on the mountainside and wanting to avoid any escalation we decided to leave as we walked away moshe sharvit went to his jeep and drove ahead of us stopping where the track turned down the mountain our way out was blocked there was noone we could appeal to apart from the man preventing us from leaving again he phoned the police asking them to come gil alexander phoned the police and his lawyer our team was worried that more settlers would come then something surprising happened i suggested to moshe sharvit that he should agree to be interviewed after a brief pause he said bring the camera what followed was less an interview than a series of declarations he was doing the work of god he said why did local bedouin shepherds say they were very afraid of him i asked no that is a lie theyre telling stories so the world will think were crazy its not true its all lies that are built on lies of dozens of years of lying… he said the arabs since the formation of the country and before all the past 77 years theyve been preoccupied with harming the people of israel harming the land of israel and causing the nation of israel to be miserable and pitiful but they dont understand that the harder they try the lion will wake from his sleep and within one day well end this story he repeated the analogy of the lion later in the interview saying in what sounded like ominous words that the palestinians were pushing the lion so hard into the corner that there will be no choice left but to finish this story 7 october was small one day itll be big as for peaceful coexistence such as gil alexander supports he said there was no such thing as peace with enemies who try to destroy you moshe sharvits brother harel was killed fighting in gaza in december 2023 his world is the pastureland the stony hills of the jordan valley his sheep and cattle the bed and breakfast he has opened he produced a glossy video replete with a backing track of american country music to promote his venture he spoke with contempt for the british sanctions against him they were a new kind of antisemitism he claimed the minute someone tries to hurt me i get stronger my spirit…i receive energies my spirit continues on its mission i continue advancing forward and planting roots deep into the land of israel im not bothered by britain or america or anyone moshe sharvit agreed to be interviewed then he drove away we were free to move on later as we were having lunch in a café about 15km nine miles away a policeman appeared looking for gil alexander he went with the police officer for questioning after about an hour he returned telling us he had been ordered not to enter the jordan valley for two weeks he plans to lodge his own complaint against moshe sharvit over the incident we went to gil alexanders home in a kibbutz inside israel that overlooks the valley gunmen from the palestinian city of jenin fired at the kibbutz two years ago gil alexander is not a pacifist if he is attacked by hamas or any other group he will defend himself he said a son of our friends two months ago he was killed here by a terrorist he was a soldier in the reserves 46 years old with six children he volunteered for the reserves to protect me if the army hadnt been there they would have come here he was killed while defending me and today he is buried next to my two sons but gil alexander seemed weary as we sat drinking tea amid the bright red flowers of his welltended garden and the fluttering yellow flags that symbolise israels hostages held in gaza he spoke of a beloved nephew killed fighting in lebanon in an earlier war did he not i wondered at the age of 72 think about retiring from the struggle and enjoying his garden he laughed there was no chance of that after two of his sons took their own lives – one was in the army the other was about to enter the military – he had found a purpose in working for what he calls the humanitarian ideals of judaism after the tragedies of my sons if i dont find meaning in life ill go crazy… and the things i do are things i believe in and these are things i also got from my father who was in the french underground during world war two and fought for french liberation but was against any type of occupation and said occupation is occupation two days after our encounter with moshe sharvit a lone woman peace activist filmed him banging on the window of her car and rocking the vehicle the woman is clearly frightened by the intimidation moshe sharvit acts as if he has nothing to fear,,,,,,,,Fresh

was released in 1963 when charlie hopkins thinks back to the three years he spent in one of americas most famous prisons he remembers the deathly quiet the most in 1955 hopkins was sent to alcatraz a famed prison on an isolated island off the coast of san francisco after causing trouble at other prisons to serve a 17year sentence for kidnapping and robbery falling asleep at night in his cell on the remote island he said the only sound was the whistle of ships passing thats a lonely sound hopkins said it reminds you of hank williams singing that song im so lonesome i could cry now 93 and living in florida hopkins said the san francisco national archives informed him that he is likely the last surviving former alcatraz inmate another former inmate william baker appeared to be alive as of last year in an interview with the bbc this week hopkins described life at alcatraz which formed the setting for the 1996 film the rock where he made friends with gangsters and once helped plan an unsuccessful escape although it closed decades ago us president donald trump recently claimed that he wants to reopen it as a federal prison when hopkins was transferred to the highsecurity prison in 1955 from an atlanta facility he remembers it being clean but barren and there were few distractions no radio at the time and few books he said there was nothing to do he said you could walk back and forth in your cell or do pushups hopkins kept busy part of the time with his job cleaning alcatraz sweeping the floors and buffing them until they shined he said he was sent to prison in 1952 in jacksonville florida for his role in a series of robberies and kidnappings he was part of a group that took hostages to get through roadblocks and steal cars he said the men who broke out of alcatraz with a spoon national archives charlie hopkins spent three years in alcatraz prison after causing trouble in other facilities at alcatraz hopkins had some infamous neighbours the facility housed many violent criminals over its 30 years al capone robert stroud a murderer known as the birdman of alcatraz and crime boss james whitey bulger making it the subject of a host of films and television shows a 22acre island 125 miles 2km off san francisco and surrounded by freezing waters with strong currents alcatraz was originally a naval defence fort it was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison the us justice department took it over in the 1930s transforming the facility into a federal prison to address rampant organised crime at the time even in the highsecurity prison hopkins said he still managed to get into trouble and spent many days in the facilitys d block solitary confinement where inmates who misbehaved were held and rarely let out of their cells his longest stint there six months came after he tried to help several other prisoners including notorious bank robber forrest tucker escape alcatraz hopkins said he helped steal hacksaw blades from the prisons electric shop to cut the prison bars in the basement kitchen the plan didnt work prison guards discovered the blades in other inmates cells hopkins said a few days after they locked them up they locked me up he said but that did not stop one of the inmates in 1956 when tucker was taken to a hospital for a kidney operation he stabbed his ankle with a pencil so prison guards would have to remove his leg irons tucker told the new yorker then as he was taken to get an xray he overpowered hospital orderlies and ran away he said he was captured in a hospital gown in a cornfield hours later as more prisoners attempted to escape alcatraz over the years officials ramped up security hopkins said when i left there in 1958 the security was so tight you couldnt breathe he said all told there were 14 separate attempts over the years involving 36 inmates according to the national park service one of the most famous involved frank morris and brothers clarence and john anglin who escaped in june 1962 by placing papiermâché heads in their beds and breaking out through ventilation ducts they were never found but the fbi concluded that they drowned in the cold waters surrounding the island a year later the prison shut down after the government determined it would be more costeffective to build new prisons than to keep the remote island facility in operation now its a publicly run museum visited by millions each year that generates about 60m £45m a year in revenue for park partners the building is decrepit with peeling paint rusted pipes and crumbling toilets in each cramped cell construction on the main prison facility began in 1907 and more than a century of exposure to the elements has rendered the place all but uninhabitable trump said this week however that he wants his government to reopen and expand the island prison for the countrys most ruthless and violent offenders a tour group visits alcatraz,,,,,,,,Fresh

2025 eurovision song contest the swiss city of basel is going into party mode this weekend as it prepares to welcome the eurovision song contest its been 36 years since switzerland last hosted the contest after celine dion won in 1988 so the wait to roll out eurovisions famous turquoise carpet has been long switzerland hosted the first ever eurovision at lugano in 1956 but its record since dions victory in dublin has been mixed between 2007 and 2010 and again between 2015 and 2018 its entries failed to even qualify for the final swiss singer nemo finally won last year with the code ebu the swiss broadcaster srgssr has put up posters emphasising unity perhaps because of that basel is determined to make this contest memorable for all the right reasons at 13km 08 miles its turquoise carpet will be eurovisions longest ever stretching from basel town hall across the river rhine all the way to the eurovision village the head of basels government conradin cramer believes his city of just 175000 residents is the natural home for eurovisions estimated half a million visitors because of its borders with both france and germany basel is the heart of europe he says whats more he points out the city has a long humanist tradition when other cities in medieval europe were cracking down on free thinkers basel welcomed them so basel with its geographic location and its history of tolerance and eurovision with its tradition of inclusivity and diversity are he says the perfect match basel tourism this years eurovision is taking place in the st jakobshalle in basel last years contest in malmo attracted thousands of propalestinian demonstrators and further protests against the war in gaza are expected in basel too police have not yet released their plans to manage this but have said that everyone should have the right to express their opinion as long they stay within the law and do not risk the safety of others throughout the contest they say 1300 officers will be on duty basel has also unveiled a security operation to ensure visitors can enjoy the song contest safely they are promising mobile awareness teams safe retreats for victims of violence or hostility and a 24hour hotline the concept which basel officials describe as unique aims to prevent violence sexual assault or harassment and racist aggression and insults the awareness teams recognisable by their pink jackets will be available 24 hours a day across the city basels security director stephanie eymann said the teams were a lowthreshold measure to give visitors a chance to report harassment or assaults and seek protection even if some might not want to approach the police the entire town appears to have embraced the event with turquoise welcome flags now waving from every lamp post tickets for the contest itself sold out in minutes but basel is promising that there will be something for everyone ticket or no ticket and most of it will be free there will be concerts all over the city there will be art projects says tourism director letizia elia basel has 40 museums and galleries in a space of just 37 square kilometres a record for a european city and they are all getting involved an exhibition featuring works by andy warhol mark rothko wassily kandinsky and pablo picasso has opened at the beyeler foundation where swiss artist ugo rondinones we are poems rainbow sculpture sits on the roof theres also a glitz and glam exhibition at basels museum of natural history the celebrations have spread across switzerland with competitions across the country for the best school band –

public value section present an exhibition on eurovision but hosting an event like eurovision is never hitchfree and this one is no exception the final choice of basel as a venue was only made at the end of august last year allowing just over seven months to organise everything then came objections from evangelical christian groups who claimed eurovision undermined traditional family values and that performers regularly sang about satanism and the occult they gathered enough signatures to force a referendum aimed at banning public money for the event but on 24 november voters gave a huge yes to the song contest with 666 approving basels budget of almost 40m conradin cramer had expected a referendum because thats how switzerland works its perfectly fine but he was still delighted at the size of the vote in favour it shows this is a city where people really want to do this he is very conscious that the global debate around diversity and inclusion has changed in the year since swiss singer nemo became the first nonbinary person to win eurovision the overriding message of basel mr cramer says is everyone is welcome reuters last years winner nemo was greeted by fans offering

however hours after a ceasefire deal india and pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations underscoring its fragility india accused pakistan of repeated violations while pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire with its forces showing responsibility and restraint before trumps ceasefire announcement india and pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a fullblown conflict after a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in indianadministered kashmir last month india launched air strikes inside pakistan and pakistanadministered kashmir triggering

washington dc says us secretary of state marco rubios call to pakistani army chief asim munir on 9 may might have been the crucial point theres still much we dont know about the roles of various international actors but its clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to deescalate the us of course but also the uk and saudi arabia she says pakistans foreign minister ishaq dar told pakistani media that three dozen countries were involved in the diplomacy including turkey saudi arabia and the us one question is whether if this call had come earlier right

wrote that pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the us role in calming the conflict but diplomats say there is little doubt the us played an important role in defusing the crisis this time the us was the most prominent external player last time pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war while theyll likely exaggerate they may have played the primary diplomatic role perhaps amplifying delhis positions in islamabad mr bisaria told the bbc on saturday yet at the outset the us appeared strikingly standoffish as tensions flared us vice president jd vance said on thursday that the us was not going to get involved in a war thats fundamentally none of our business we cant control these countries though fundamentally india has its gripes with pakistan america cant tell

botswanas youngest cabinet minister she was just 26 years old at the time and had clearly impressed botswanas incoming president duma boko whose umbrella for democratic change udc had just won a landslide ousting the party that had governed for 58 years it was a seismic shift in the politics of the diamondrich southern african nation and boko a 55yearold harvardtrained lawyer hit the ground running his main focus he said was fixing an economy too reliant on diamonds telling the bbc ahead of his inauguration that he wanted young people to be the solution to become entrepreneurs employ themselves and employ others key to this was finding a suitable ambassador and chombo was clearly it a young woman already committed to various causes he made her minister of youth and gender ive never been more proud to be young she told the bbc at the ministrys headquarters in the capital gaborone im a young person living in botswana passionate about youth development gender equality but also so passionate about the development of children the beauty queen did not campaign to be an mp she is what is called a specially elected member of parliament and is now one of just six female mps in the 69member national assembly chombo said becoming an mp and then minister came as a complete surprise to her i got appointed by a president who had never met me she said miss world and the journey that i thought i was supposed to pursue as my final destination was only the platform through which i would be seen for this very role it was her crowning as miss botswana in 2022 that raised her profile and enabled her to campaign for social change while trying to inspire other young women it also gave her the opportunity to set up the lesego chombo foundation which focuses on supporting disadvantaged youngsters and their parents in rural areas – and which she is still involved with its projects funded by corporate companies and others we strive to have a world where we feel seen and heard and represented im very thrilled that i happen to be the very essence of that representation she said lesego chomboinstagram lesego chombo now 27 is an associate at a law firm in gaborone as she prepared for last years miss world pageant she said i really put myself in the zone of service i really channelled it for this big crown now in political office she is aware of the expectations placed on her in a country where approximately 60 of the population is below 35 years it also has a high level of unemployment 28 which is even higher for young people and women who have limited economic opportunities and battle systemic corruption chombo said this was something she was determined to change currently in botswana the rates of unemployment are so high but its not just the rate of unemployment its also just the sphere of youth development its lacking and so my desire is to create an ecosystem an environment a society an economy in which youth can thrive chombo said her plan was to develop a comprehensive system that nurtured youthled initiatives strengthened entrepreneurship and ensured young people had a seat at the table when decisions were being made with botswanas anticorruption policy undergoing a rigorous review she said this would ensure that quotas for young entrepreneurs when state departments and agencies put out tenders for goods and services were actually reached the government has begun a 10month forensic audit of government spending that will include 30 stateowned enterprises indeed president boko is intent on cracking down on corruption seeing this as a way to bolter investor confidence and diversify the economy something his deputy has been seeking to do on recent trips to the united arab emirates uae and switzerland and a key deal has now been secured with uaebased cci global a provider of business process outsourcing to open a hub in botswana while youth development is a central pillar of her work gender equity also remains close to her heart her short time in office has coincided with a growing outcry over genderbased violence according to a united nations population fund unfpa report over 67 of women in botswana have experienced abuse more than double the global average it hurts to know that it could be me next she admitted a month into her appointment she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create peace desks at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims at the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness this was followed in january by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue the minister reiterated on several occasions including before parliament in march that botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied but she told the bbc the government would be pushing for the implementation of a genderbased violence act aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors she said she was also advocating a more holistic approach involving the ministries of health education and local government we want curriculums that promote gender equity from a young age chombo said we want to teach children what genderbased violence is and how to prevent it it will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home how parents behave around their children how they model good behaviour lesego chomboinstagram lesego chombo has used her fame to push her projects for social change focusing on young people she has also been vocal about the need to address issues affecting men particularly around mental health and positive masculinity encouraging chiefs to ensure that our patriarchal culture is not actively perpetuating gender violence i hear a lot of people say why do you speak of women more than men its because as it stands in society women are mostly prejudiced against but when we speak of gender equality were saying that it should be applied equally for everyone but what we strive for is gender equity chombo who studied law at the university of botswana said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her saying that women had to work 10 times harder to succeed my mother has managed to create an environment for me to thrive and growing up i got to realise that its not an easy thing as women we face so many pressures a woman cannot do this a woman cant do that a woman cant be young and in leadership im currently facing that she also credited julia morley the ceo of miss

caption abdel kareem hanaap tel aviv israel — on the eve of president trumps visit to arab allies in the gulf the us and israel have announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies back into gaza after a tenweek israeli ban that aid workers say is driving rampant hunger in the territory it is the result of pressure by the trump administration on israel to allow aid back into gaza according to a person familiar with the details who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal diplomacy the proposed solution would only provide food and aid to around 60 percent of gazas civilians initially according to a copy of the proposal reviewed by npr key details remain unresolved like who would run it or pay for it sponsor message the program is an aboutface from israels earlier policy to withhold aid to pressure hamas to free israeli hostages us ambassador to israel mike huckabee says israel is fully on board with the new proposal president trump has made very clear

details according to a 14page proposal reviewed by npr a private charity recently registered in switzerland called the gaza humanitarian foundation would establish four aid distribution sites and hand out prepackaged food hygiene kits and medical supplies israels foreign minister gideon saar publicly endorsed the us plan sunday and called on countries and aid groups to cooperate it will enable aid to go directly to the people hamas must not be allowed to get their hands on it saar said israeli soldiers will not allocate aid they will secure the perimeter israel says hamas has taken advantage of aid deliveries seizing supplies profiting from black market sales and using aid distribution to assert its control of gaza un officials say there is no largescale diversion of aid in gaza the aid we coordinate goes to the people for whom its intended said olga cherevko of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs we have mechanisms in place that help mitigate this including monitoring during and after distribution hotlines to report incidents and our accountability to donors israel says it will first wait for trump to finish his trip this week to saudi arabia qatar and

be scaled up to serve larger populations sponsor message the main aid organizations working in gaza are refusing to cooperate with the proposal as presented by israeli officials to the un and its aid partners humanitarian groups say they cannot work with a program that refuses aid to anyone seeking it even belligerents it contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over lifesustaining items as a pressure tactic — as part of a military strategy the united nations and its aid partners in gaza said in a joint statement we will not participate in any scheme that does not adhere to the global humanitarian principles of humanity impartiality independence and neutrality the us says it is still in talks with aid professionals to finalize who would run the program huckabee said he did not have the details on who would fund the program but cited some contributors who wish to remain unnamed toggle caption jehad alshrafiap why humanitarian aid groups oppose the program the proposed us aid program for gaza would be a significant departure from the established unled system that has long been the cornerstone of humanitarian response in conflict zones aid experts say it would skirt the alreadyexisting system for aid delivery replacing around 400 un distribution points across gaza with just around four distribution points which experts say would overwhelm the system and make it hard to ensure fair distribution to hundreds of thousands of people it would advance israels plans to coerce palestinians to move from north to south

not believe they possessed the capacity to achieve the standards i had set but because i was their mother i could see their potential i pushed them hard so that they would make it in life i watched them closely and monitored their performances in school and had the time to discuss their progress with their teachers as they grew up and started to understand i became their friend and this helped

was best for them in the long run sponsor message were you ever tempted to give in and be a fun mom i stuck to my standards because i saw the potential in each of my children and i had to exploit that

poverty trying to make sure their kids have enough to eat and can get an education and have a better life let their children be their biggest priority young mothers should focus on their children how

for me kids michael recalls then the film showed the same people being beaten by policemen firemen were knocking women and kids to the ground and they were getting pinned against buildings by highpressure firehoses worst as far as i was concerned was big german shepherds were being sent to bite all these people the dog attacks were particularly incomprehensible to him as his favorite tv show featured lassie a heroic collie this shocking contrast upended his understanding of the world to him police and firefighters were figures who protected people not ones who caused harm confused he finally asked his mother why these people were being hurt was it because black people are bad that was the only logical answer i could come up with michael says this question shook his mother and she devised a plan to help him understand he remembers her saying some people just wont accept others if their shells are different colors his mother helped him understand that the protests he saw on tv were about people demonstrating against the mistreatment of black individuals because of the color of their skin and that such behavior was wrong michael doesnt recall many discussions about civil rights but that conversation with his mother was all i ever needed to set my moral compass from that moment i knew i was going to protect anyone who was being treated meanly even if it meant stopping

caption andrea hsunpr by late march anthony lee should have gotten a heads up that mass layoffs at the food and drug administration were about to begin instead the union president found out when he started getting panicked calls early one morning employees were learning they were being fired while swiping their badges to get into work a green light meant go a red light meant stop for dozens hundreds of employees it just went red and they werent able to enter the building lee says thats the way a lot of people did find out that their federal service was ending sponsor message lee is president of nteu chapter 282 the union representing close to 9000 fda employees under the unions collective bargaining agreement the government is required to provide advance notice of any reduction in force but the trump administration gave no such notice nor did it consult with lee when it ended the unions telework agreement basically weve been ignored says lee attacks on unions exponentially worse president trumps antipathy toward federal sector unions is well known still lee says trumps attacks on unions now are exponentially worse than in the presidents first term even our ability to exist in the federal workplace — to be able to represent employees — is threatened by this administration he says trumps efforts to slash the federal workforce by hundreds of thousands of workers could decimate union bargaining units and even where workers remain he has moved to end the right to union representation for wide swaths of the workforce in late march trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal workers citing a provision in federal law that gives presidents the authority to do so at agencies that have national security as a primary mission already employees at agencies such as the cia the fbi and the national security agency have no collective bargaining rights trumps executive order went much further sweeping up a broad array of agencies those exclusions have never applied to including the environmental protection agency the department of veterans affairs and the fda sponsor message multiple lawsuits are challenging that order in late april a federal judge issued an injunction blocking it for now but the trump administration has appealed that decision collective bargaining as a check on presidential power trump has argued that having to negotiate with unions over workplace matters impedes his ability to manage the government as he sees fit some would say thats by design in a new york university law review article nicholas handler an associate professor of law at texas am school of law argues that collective bargaining serves as a check on presidential power the binding agreements that unions negotiate with federal agencies over personnel matters such as working conditions performance reviews and grievance procedures restrain and reshape the presidents power to manage the federal bureaucracy he writes toggle caption kevin dietschgetty images north america civil servants did not always have this leverage in the first half of the 20th century even as labor unions gained strength elsewhere there was a fear of giving federal workers too much say over how the nations laws were carried out after all civil servants serve the american people as such federal employees have never had the right to strike they also cant negotiate over wages a recruiting crisis led to a turning point but in the early 1960s the federal government was facing a labor crunch it needed scientists economists and lawyers to staff growing agencies but it couldnt pay big salaries what it could offer was stability job protections and — after president john f kennedy signed a 1962 executive order — the right to unionize collective bargaining becomes an attractive tool for presidents to recruit people into the federal civil service and take advantage of a lot of those highly skilled workers that otherwise might be difficult to recruit says handler congress later codified those labor protections in the civil service reform act of 1978 asserting that the right to organize and collectively bargain contributes to the effective conduct of public business and safeguards the public interest through the law congress also created for itself and the courts a way to police the executive branch handler says sponsor message consider a scenario in which a president wants to weaken a particular agency such as the epa one way to undermine the agency would be to make life for epa workers miserable he explains collective bargaining gives those employees a way to push back to preserve their ability to carry out their agencys mission as congress intended now trump says those labor rights congress established in 1978 make federal workers unaccountable the csra enables hostile federal unions to obstruct agency management states a white house document explaining his executive order this is dangerous in agencies with national security responsibilities losing protections that made the jobs worthwhile lee a 23year veteran of the fda in addition to being union president worries that if trump gets his way workers will lose the stability and protections that made working for the government worthwhile hes especially concerned that scientists will become vulnerable to political pressure under the union contract employees who review food ingredients drugs and medical devices have a right to flag safety or efficacy concerns without fear of retribution it remains to be seen as to whether or not theyre going to allow employees to do the job that the public expects protecting and promoting the health and safety of the public lee says a debate over efficiency toggle caption andrea hsunpr one of trumps repeated complaints is that unions make it too hard to get rid of poor performers many union contracts spell out lengthy processes for doing so but others contend unions help make the government run more smoothly our collective bargaining agreement is a huge efficiency boost for the government says armando rosariolebron a vice president of the national association of agriculture employees which represents employees of the us department of agricultures animal and plant health inspection service his bargaining unit includes people who are tasked with keeping invasive pests and plants out of the country work that requires a lot of overtime rosariolebron says the union largely manages that sponsor message you have some employees who want as much overtime as possible to earn as much income as they can you have other employees who dont want to be overworked to death so to speak he says figuring out how to assign overtime and being the liaison between management and employees probably represent the unions biggest savings to the government says rosariolebron i know that a lot of managers love that he says rosariolebron says he tries to resolve most disputes outside the formal grievance process he says there are plenty of times hes advised employees against pursuing complaints he sees as frivolous i dont recommend you go down that path because its not going to end well for you he says hes told them employees are more likely to listen to the union on such matters he says he has a warning for the trump administration get rid of the union and

rubber duck museum is migrating to canada to stay afloat toggle caption neil king if you had to pick just one place to take the temperature of relations between the us and canada right now consider the rubber duck museum in point roberts wash the museum is located in a small us town attached to canada not the us mainland the only way to drive to the town which is at the end of a peninsula is to go through canada this unique location makes the town of about 1200 people dependent upon its northern neighbor for nearly everything including customers looking to add to their rubber duck collections sponsor message neil and krystal king are the owners of the rubber duck museum and gift shop on display they have ducks from the soviet era early disney toys and a rubber ducky belonging to sesame street star ernie but a big draw — and what keeps the museum afloat — are the 3000 ducks for sale most are whimsical featuring celebrities and historical figures and cartoon and holidaythemed characters but the ducks are no longer flying off the shelves since president trump launched tariff wars on countries including canada and china and began insisting canada will be the 51st state far fewer canadian visitors have flocked to this us outpost after months of dismal sales and now looking at 145 tariffs on goods from china the kings say they are packing up the ducks and moving them across the border into canada toggle caption neil king weve had a lot of regulars and loyal customers reach out to us throughout this whole thing the last couple of months and theyre pretty much all saying the exact same thing krystal said they feel very offended by a lot of the rhetoric coming out of the white house right now relations soured between the two countries in february when president trump in a phone call to then prime minister justin trudeau questioned the validity of the border treaty between the us and canada trump also mentioned his dislike of the longstanding watersharing agreements between the two countries and negotiations over several deals have since been put on pause sponsor message president trump has said tariffs are to stop countries that he says are taking advantage of the us including canada and to strengthen the nations economic position many canadians see it differently what he trump wants is to see a total collapse of the canadian economy because thatll make it easier to annex us trudeau told the news media in march after washington imposed 25 tariffs on canada ottawa answered in kind trudeau urged canadians to stay home and spend their money domestically and thats just what many have done they dont like their sovereignty being threatened krystal said they feel like the only tool they have is boycotting the united states and keeping those tourist dollars out of there it appears to be working in march the number of cars going through the busy border crossing in blaine wash was down nearly 28 compared to the previous year according to the us bureau of transportation statistics canadians make up the largest number of international visitors to the us and last year they generated 205 billion in spending according to the nonprofit us travel association but its also true that the canadian dollar has fallen in value —though it has recently clawed back some of its losses—making the us more expensive and less attractive id say its a pretty effective tool krystal said referring to the boycott normally the small towns streets are bustling with canadians who love to cross the border for cheaper food and gas these days the shops and restaurants are nearly empty every conversation weve had theyve been very polite in true canadian fashion she said very apologetic that itll affect us personally but yeah theyre feeling very strongly right now about this issue there are other factors at work nearly all the ducks the kings sell in their gift shop are made in china so they are subject to the 145 tariffs that president trump placed on china and went into effect last month sponsor message there is a limit on how much someone is going to pay for a rubber duck the business owners said we already have to keep our prices artificially low because of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar krystal said so our customers coming in already have compromised buying power the kings who opened up the museum almost a year ago said they simply cant afford to keep the rubber duck museum open in point roberts but they dont want to close their doors either it is so unique so fun neil said the people that come in just laugh and laugh … and we just dont want to lose that this summer they plan to move the museum collection and shop just across the border into canada and reopen there they wont have to pay the 145 tariffs on the ducks from china and they wont be at the whims of international diplomacy or the lack of it theyll continue to live in point roberts the place they call home and where they are raising their 3yearold daughter even if president trump were to suddenly drop the tariffs the kings said they would still move their little museum to canada its just the instability of you know waking up every day and going is today a tariff day or not neil said it just isnt a sustainable business model for any small business let alone a small business that is reliant on canadian tourism its not the step we wanted to take honestly krystal added we love having our quaint little shop here it means so much to us… but its not a choice between moving the ducks to canada or keeping them here its a choice between moving

be released hamas has said it will release a usisraeli captive held in gaza as the group confirmed it was engaged in direct talks with the united states towards securing a ceasefire in the warravaged enclave and getting aid flowing again to a suffering palestinian population the palestinian group released a statement on sunday “israeli soldier edan alexander a dual us national will be released as part of efforts towards a ceasefire” and the reopening of aid crossings israel has blocked all aid including food medicine and fuel for 70 days the hamas statement did not indicate when the 21yearold alexander would be released but it is thought to be in the coming 48 hours israeli media reported that us envoy steve witkoff will be in israel on monday as part of the deal the announcement comes shortly before us president donald trump’s visit to the middle east this week – which does not include a trip to israel trump and witkoff have frequently mentioned alexander by name in the past few months advertisement alexander who grew up in the us was taken from his military base during the october 7 2023 hamasled attack in its statement on sunday hamas said it was willing to “immediately begin intensive negotiations” that could lead to an agreement to end the war and would see gaza under a technocratic and independent administration “this will ensure calm and stability for many years along with reconstruction and the end of the blockade” the group said there was no immediate comment from the trump administration israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s office said on sunday that the us told israel that hamas’s freeing of alexander would lead to negotiations for the release of more captives the statement added that israel’s policy hasn’t changed negotiations will be conducted under fire with a continued commitment to achieving all war objectives ‘a lot of questions’ al jazeera’s hamdah salhut reporting from amman jordan said “it’s unclear exactly what kind of reaction the israeli government officials had with these direct talks between hamas and the united states but last time they were quite angry and that’s because the israelis weren’t involved and had no knowledge of those talks and the americans hit back by saying they didn’t need anyone’s permission to negotiate with any of the actors involved because they were american captives held in gaza” “there are a lot of questions from a lot of different angles specifically from the family members of those captives from the larger part of israeli society who have been protesting in the thousands for more than 15 years accusing benjamin netanyahu of prolonging the war for his own personal and political gain and in fact israeli officials have been saying the quiet part out loud in recent weeks saying that the captives were not the main priority for the israeli government and that they had other goals and objectives they needed to achieve” she added advertisement “the family members of captives say that the israeli government is choosing land grabs over the lives of israelis who are still being held in gaza” she continued referring to the israeli government’s decision to expand its offensive in gaza with a view to reoccupying parts of the territory talks ongoing in doha earlier on sunday two hamas officials told the afp news agency that talks were ongoing in the qatari capital of doha with the us and reported “progress” had been made one hamas official speaking about the talks with the us said there was “progress made … notably on the entry of aid to the gaza strip” and the potential exchange of captives for palestinian prisoners in israeli custody a second official also reported progress “on the ceasefire in the gaza strip” israel shattered the last ceasefire which lasted two months on march 18 launching a major offensive in gaza and ramping up its bombardment of the territory it has also cut off all aid to gaza since march 2 saying it would pressure hamas to release the remaining captives none have been released since the fleeting truce earlier this year when several captives were exchanged for palestinian prisoners a total of 59 captives are still in gaza around a third of them believed to be alive after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals starvation has taken hold across gaza due to the israeli blockade earlier

Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/11/fact-checking-trumps-claim-of-securing-10-trillion-in-investments-for-us?traffic_source=rss,the white house reports 51 trillion in promised investments with 43 trillion newly pledged but experts say 21 trillion may not fully happen since returning to the white house us president donald trump has touted corporate and foreign us investment announcements as proof he is ushering in “the golden age of america” on january 21 trump said that before he’d finished the “first full business day” of his second term the united states had “already secured nearly 3 trillion of new investments” on april 2 he said “it looks like we’re going to have about 6 trillion of investments” six days later trump told national republican congressional committee dinner attendees that the investment total was “now revised up to about 7 trillion” during an april 30 newsnation town hall trump speculated that “it could be more than 8 trillion” on may 4 trump told kristen welker the host of the nbc news programme meet the press “i think we probably have close to 9 trillion of investments coming into this country” on may 6 trump told reporters “i think the real number could be 9 or 10 trillion” finally on may 8 trump said “we have now close to 10 trillion — think of that 10 trillion” in investments “we’re talking about essentially two months” advertisement that’s far beyond the figures the white house has released publicly we tallied the white house’s public lists of investments they amount to 21 trillion in corporate investments or at most 51 trillion when including promised investments from other countries experts cautioned that the promised corporate investments are not guaranteed to materialise in full or during trump’s presidency and some of them would have occurred regardless of who was president trump isn’t the first to overstate new investments on his watch outgoing us president joe biden said in 2024 that his bipartisan chips and science act had attracted 640bn in private investments economists told politifact that biden’s numbers were based on what companies had announced which is not the same as dollars already spent roman v yampolskiy a university of louisville professor and a specialist in artificial intelligence which dominates the promised investments trump cited said “historically largescale investment announcements often overpromise and underdeliver there is a performative element to them especially in politically charged contexts they function as political theatre as much as economic commitment” white house lists do not match trump’s words since trump’s inauguration the white house has publicised investment announcements from three countries and roughly 60 companies on its website including in a “noncomprehensive running list” many of the highestdollar corporate announcements were in march and april corporate announcements in the white house’s lists total approximately 21 trillion worth of us investment advertisement the white house separately has cited commitments from the united arab emirates to invest 14 trillion over the next 10 years from japan to “boost” its investment in the us to 1 trillion and from saudi arabia to invest 600bn in the us during trump’s presidency combined with the corporate announcements these bring the total to about 51 trillion 49 trillion short of trump’s figure but the 51 trillion total has caveats for example the white house said “japan announced a 1 trillion investment in the us” but the article it linked said in 2023 japan’s us investment was 7833bn and japan would “boost” that to 1 trillion that’s an increase of 2167bn rather than a new 1 trillion investment that would put the total value of newly pledged us investment at about 43 trillion trump’s secondterm white house tally of us investments the white house figures can’t easily be used for applestoapples comparisons some of the investments are planned over trump’s fouryear term others over five years or a decade in one case – adq and energy capital partners’ planned 25bn investment — it isn’t limited to usbased projects the white house declined to detail additional investments a spokesperson pointed to federal bureau of economic analysis data that shows a 22 percent increase in business investment in the first quarter of 2025 calling it a historic increase however experts cautioned this increase was shaped by businesses stocking up on inventory before trump’s tariffs take effect and said the increase is unlikely to be sustained advertisement many of the announcements are aspirational experts say experts told politifact that each of the five biggest investments on trump’s list warrants some caution because they might not reach trump’s cited dollar amounts or were not solely prompted by trump’s policies “many of these announcements particularly those in the ai and semiconductor sectors appear to be at least in part aspirational in nature” yampolskiy said “they serve a signalling function to attract investor attention shape policy discourse and secure favourable regulatory or funding environments” the five largest company investments collectively account for 82 percent of the dollar value on the white house’s corporate list five companies accounting for the majority of new investment promises are stargate the stargate project is an artificial intelligence collaboration among openai oracle and softbank announced during a january 21 white house event the white house values the investment at 500bn the company’s official announcement says 100bn will be invested “immediately” and that it “intends to invest” a total of 500bn over the next four years a goal repeated by softbank ceo masayoshi son at the white house event “whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen” wrote john higgins chief economist at capital economics an international consulting firm enrique dans who studies technology and policy at madrid’s ie business school said the 500bn figure is “astronomical – roughly 2 percent of us gross domestic product – and lacks clear documentation” advertisement at the white house event openai ceo sam altman said “we wouldn’t be able to do this without you mr president” but altman had been discussing plans for a 100bn investment 10 months before trump won his second term the washington post reported including an abilene texas data centre that began construction in summer 2024 “ai investments have been on a global trajectory driven by technological maturity and competitive pressure especially from china” dans said “any us president would have seen a surge” nvidia nvidia corp another ai company said it plans to invest up to 500bn in us infrastructure over the next four years previously nvidia manufactured most of its chips in taiwan “it is unlikely nvidia would have moved any production to the us if it was not for pressure from the trump administration” gil luria an analyst with the financial services firm da davidson told reuters however luria added “the half a trillion number is likely hyperbole” dans said that although tax cuts from trump’s first term have benefited the company’s focus on usbased efforts “the core growth likely would have occurred anyway” regardless of the president apple on february 24 days after apple’s ceo tim cook met with trump the consumer electronics giant announced it plans to spend “more than 500bn in the us over the next four years” analysts have expressed scepticism that this represents new investment dans called the investment “simply more of what apple already does” from “daytoday activities with thousands of suppliers in all 50 states to the operation of its domestic data centres as well as its investments in apple tv and other projects already manufactured in the country” advertisement in a note to investors david vogt an analyst with the swissbased bank ubs wrote “call us a sceptic … we believe the figure lacks substance” ibm ibm announced april 28 plans to invest 150bn in the us including more than 30bn in research and development on usbased manufacturing of mainframe and quantum computers this is “not clearly trumprelated” dans said “ibm’s strategy pivots have been under way since the 2010s” luria said “while we believe ibm will continue to invest in the emerging area of quantum technology the bombastic figure is more likely a gesture towards the us administration” reuters reported taiwan semiconductor manufacturing taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co which makes semiconductors for computing and electronics has pledged to spend 100bn in the us analysts said this number is the most wellsupported among the investments that trump cites although bringing semiconductor production back to the us began during trump’s first term it was “greatly accelerated by” biden’s chips and science act which prompted years of investment before trump’s second term dans said over the past five years the company has spent at least 65bn on fabrication facilities near phoenix arizona funded in part by 66bn from the chips and science act overall dans said “trump might deserve some partial credit for setting a more aggressive tone on economic nationalism and supply chain reshoring and for lowering the corporate tax reform which did affect repatriation and some investment decisions but most of these trends — the ai boom the semiconductor reshoring the cloud computing infrastructure — are longterm structural shifts that predate trump and will continue regardless of who is in office” advertisement our ruling trump said “we have now close to 10 trillion think of that 10 trillion” in investments “we’re talking about essentially two months” the white house has pointed to investment announcements totalling 51 trillion including 21 trillion from companies and the rest from countries that’s at least 49 trillion short of trump’s figure and these announcements represent future spending some of which is planned over four years five years or a decade experts said many of the dollar amounts are aspirational and that the investments announced

A0697,2025-05-11,1,Is due process different for undocumented immigrants as Trump claims?,Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/11/is-due-process-different-for-undocumented-immigrants-as-trump-claims?traffic_source=rss,the us constitution ensures all immigrants have due process but rights depend on legal status and time spent in the us in a recent tv interview united states president donald trump said he did not know whether he needed to uphold the us constitution trump was answering a question on nbc news last week about whether undocumented immigrants in the us are entitled to due process “they talk about due process but do you get due process when you’re here illegally” trump asked the interviewer kristen welker nbc’s meet the press moderator “the constitution says every person citizens and noncitizens deserves due process” welker responded she then asked trump whether he agreed with us secretary of state marco rubio who said noncitizens are entitled to due process trump “i don’t know i’m not a lawyer i don’t know” welker “well the fifth amendment says as much” trump “i don’t know it might say that but if you’re talking about that then we’d have to have a million or two million or three million trials” welker “but even given those numbers that you’re talking about don’t you need to uphold the constitution of the united states as president” advertisement trump “i don’t know i have to respond by saying again i have brilliant lawyers that work for me and they are going to obviously follow what the supreme court said what you said is not what i heard the supreme court said they have a different interpretation” that was not the first time trump had brushed aside immigrants’ due process rights in an abc news interview marking trump’s first 100 days in office correspondent terry moran asked trump “but in our country even bad guys get due process right” trump answered “if people come into our country illegally there’s a different standard” during a may 1 speech at the university of alabama’s commencement ceremony trump said “judges are interfering supposedly based on due process but how can you give due process to people who came into our country illegally they want to give them due process i don’t know” days later while announcing that the 2027 nfl national football league draft will be in washington dc trump said “the courts have all of a sudden out of nowhere they said maybe you have to have trials trials we’re gonna have five million trials doesn’t work … past presidents took out hundreds of thousands of people when needed … they didn’t go through any of this” despite trump’s dismissal of and questions about due process for immigrants the us constitution legal experts and decades of court decisions agree immigrants regardless of how they entered the us legally or illegally have due process rights advertisement what those rights look like varies depending on how long a person has been in the us and what their legal status is what are due process rights due process generally refers to the government’s requirement to follow fair procedures and laws the constitution’s fifth and fourteenth amendments protect “any person” against being deprived by the us government of “life liberty or property without due process of law” “people have a right to be heard and there are certain steps that need to be taken before someone can say be jailed” kathleen bushjoseph a lawyer and policy analyst at the nonpartisan migration policy institute said several court rulings have determined that due process rights are extended to all people in the us not just us citizens or immigrants in the country legally the us constitution and the immigration and nationality act dictate the process the government must use to afford immigrants due process rights in immigration due process generally refers to “appropriate notice of government action the opportunity to have a hearing or some sort of screening interview to figure out are you actually a person who falls within the law that says that you can be deported” katherine yon ebright a lawyer at the brennan centre for justice’s liberty and national security programme said for example if the government seeks to deport people who are undocumented the government generally must give them a charging document known as a “notice to appear” eventually immigrants go before an immigration judge to present evidence and make a case that they qualify for some form of relief against deportation such as asylum advertisement without due process legal experts say us citizens could also be deported “the whole point of due process is to determine whether you’re the kind of person who can be subject to deportation” ilya somin a george mason university constitutional law professor said “if there is no due process then the government can simply deport people or punish them at will … because how can you show that you’re actually a us citizen if you’re not getting any due process” how do due process rights differ for noncitizens compared with us citizens even though all people in the us have due process rights for noncitizens the specifics of the process and the extent of protections vary the term noncitizen applies to people with legal documents as well as those without any documents including people here on visas with lawful permanent status or without a legal immigration status there is a “sliding scale of different protections that people can have depending on what their immigration status is” yon ebright said noncitizens are not entitled to governmentappointed lawyers during immigration proceedings for example and some immigrants who recently entered the us without a legal document do not have to appear before a judge before being deported these cases are subject to what is called the expedited removal process under expedited removal certain people can be quickly deported without a court case however people who express fear of persecution if they return to their home countries are referred to immigration officers who determine whether the immigrant is eligible for asylum or other deportation protections immigrants who pass the “credible fear” screening are referred to an immigration court where they can present their case advertisement in the past people were placed in expedited removal if they were within 100 miles about 161km of the border and within two weeks of their entry in january trump expanded expedited removal for anyone who cannot prove they have been in the us for more than two years the alien enemies act of 1798 a wartime power that trump invoked in march allows the government to deport “alien enemies” he has used that law to deport people his administration says are members of the venezuelan prison gang tren de aragua without immigration court hearings the trump administration has deported hundreds of people under the law however the us supreme court ruled against the administration on april 7 saying it must give immigrants notice that they will be deported under the alien enemies act and give them “reasonable time” to challenge the deportation in court although expedited removal and the alien enemies act limit people’s due process protections they do not eliminate them “there are no exceptions to due process” bushjoseph said additionally noncitizens who are charged with crimes receive the same due process protections as us citizens in criminal court somin said “all of the protections of the bill of rights apply in criminal court” somin said “there has to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt he or she is entitled to a jury trial rights against selfincrimination right to counsel and so on” why are immigrants’ due process rights making headlines now the trump administration faces several court cases dealing with deportations and immigrants’ due process rights they include challenges over trump’s use of the alien enemies act and the government’s mistaken deportation of a salvadoran man advertisement administration officials have criticised judges and rejected immigrants’ due process protections “due process guarantees the rights of a criminal defendant facing prosecution not an illegal alien facing deportation” white house adviser stephen miller posted on x on may 5 the trump administration’s comments about due process are centred on his promise to carry out the largest deportation operation in us history the administration’s current deportation pace is below its goal of one million people each year the migration policy institute said in an april 24 analysis nayna gupta policy director of the immigrant rights advocacy group american immigration council said the trump administration is attempting to “get around those obstacles and those requirements” of due process “just to meet some target deportation number” to reach trump’s goal of one million deportations annually the administration would need to deport people who have lived in the us for years and have no criminal convictions whom past administrations have not prioritised for deportation past presidents were also required to uphold noncitizens’ due process rights but deportation processes moved more quickly under administrations that focused on people who had recently crossed the border illegally bushjoseph said that option is more limited for the trump administration because undocumented immigration has reached historic lows under trump trump is correct that deporting millions of people living in the us without legal documents would require millions of court cases tara watson director of the centre for economic security and opportunity at the brookings institution said that has long been the case advertisement millions of immigration court cases are backlogged and the trump administration has fired several immigration judges who would hear these cases the administration’s goal for mass deportation does not change due process rules and standards “it is true that due process slows down the machinery of deportation but due process is also what separates democracies from dictatorships” watson said our ruling trump said “if people come into our country without documents there’s a different standard for due process” all people in the us regardless of their immigration status have due process rights based on the us constitution and decades of court decisions that applies whether they entered the us legally or without any documents for noncitizens people’s due process protections vary based on their legal status or how long they have been in the us legal experts say despite due process variations there are no exceptions to due process requirements for immigrants we rate trump’s statement false,,,,,,,,Fresh

and immediate” ceasefire between india and pakistan brokered by his administration us media reported that alarmed by intelligence signalling further escalation vice president jd vance secretary of state marco rubio and white house chief of staff susie wiles drove urgent mediation vance warned indian prime minister narendra modi of catastrophic risks and encouraged direct talks between india and pakistan the announcement of the ceasefire was received across the world with a sigh of relief the spectre of a nuclear exchange which according to one 2019 study could kill up to 125 million people in less than a week had fuelled regional anxiety and spurred the us diplomatic frenzy in india however trump’s announcement was seen differently in some quarters former indian army chief ved prakash malik posted on x “ceasefire 10 may 25 we have left india’s future history to ask what politicostrategic advantages if any were gained after its kinetic and nonkinetic actions” mp asaduddin owaisi wrote on the same platform “i wish our pm narendramodi had announced the ceasefire rather than the president of a foreign country we have always been opposed to third party intervention since simla 1972 why have we now accepted it i hope the kashmir issue will not be internationalised as it is our internal matter” advertisement the latter comment likely refers to trump’s statement that he is willing to work with india and pakistan “to see if after a ‘thousand years’ a solution can be arrived at concerning kashmir” the ceasefire announcement by the us president appears to have been perceived by some in india as a sign of the modi government’s retreat under us pressure while his offer to mediate on kashmir is being seen as an indication that india’s longstanding rejection of thirdparty intervention is being undermined in south asian geopolitics perception often outpaces reality – until reality bites india has long projected regional dominance bolstered by economic growth and nuclear might yet its actions in the aftermath of the april 22 massacre carried out by the resistance front trf in kashmir exposed its vulnerabilities intended to assert strength india’s response faltered boosting pakistan’s regional standing and leaving modi’s government diplomatically weakened on may 7 india launched operation sindoor to dismantle terrorist bases linked to groups like the trf which it claims is supported by pakistan backed by frenchmade rafale jets the operation sought to project modi’s strongman image amid domestic outrage yet its success was contested pakistan reported civilian casualties including children while india insisted only terrorist sites were hit pakistan’s air force scrambled its own jets to deflect the attack and claimed it downed five indian jets including three rafales two us officials confirmed to the reuters news agency that a chinesemade j10 jet shot down at least two indian planes aided by chinese intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr support india has not acknowledged any losses advertisement indian media initially claimed devastating strikes on pakistani cities including karachi’s seaport but these reports

with shortrange missile and drone strikes targeting indian airbases at udhampur pathankot adampur and bhuj indian air force officer vyomika singh reported pakistani drones and munitions hit civilian and military targets india’s image as a regional hegemon frayed the indian government clearly overestimated its rafale jets and underestimated pakistan’s chinesebacked isr systems which enhanced battlefield precision china’s military support for pakistan has increased significantly in recent years since 2020 it has accounted for 81 percent of islamabad’s military imports for years some indian defence analysts warned that india’s military was unprepared for a chinasupported pakistan given its limited us or russian backing for its highrisk kashmir gamble others criticised the government’s foreign policy for encouraging chinapakistan rapprochement their warnings remained unheeded in new delhi the events of the past few days exposed india’s strategic limits replacing ambiguity with global scrutiny the kneejerk reaction in new delhi may be to increase the defence budget and deepen even further the militarisation of kashmir as the indian government plans its next steps it should do well to consider that the status quo of shadow war and the cycle of covert aggression fuelling unrest is untenable both nations’ intelligence agencies have long backed proxies driving instability from kashmir to afghanistan advertisement the path forward rests on new delhi and islamabad making wise choices restraint not rhetoric should shape policies moving forward failure to do so risks

A0704,2025-05-11,1,What the Christians of the Holy Land expect from Pope Leo XIV,Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/5/11/what-the-christians-of-the-holy-land-expect-from-pope-leo-xiv?traffic_source=rss,we hope to see in the new pope a father who will stand by our side and protect us from oppression many christians of the holy land rejoiced at the election of pope leo xiv as the successor to saint peter many of us hope that the new pope will follow the legacy of his predecessor pope francis particularly with regard to issues of justice and peace the holy see has historically played an important role in supporting the christian presence in the holy land whether through church activities engagement with influential parties in and around the region or through material and moral support this has been reflected in the establishment of institutions such as the pontifical mission in jerusalem bethlehem university the benedictus center in nazareth and most recently the donation by pope francis of the popemobile to serve as a mobile clinic for children in gaza some of the most impactful moments in our recent history have been papal visits to our land — starting with pope paul vi in 1964 followed by pope john paul ii in 2000 pope benedict xvi in 2009 and concluding with pope francis in 2014 advertisement we christians in the holy land hope that pope leo xiv will not only come to visit us but also help address some of the challenges we face today in the birthplace of christianity as a community of 230000 people we are working to strengthen the christian presence as an active component of the local society in collaboration with its other components however we do need help one of the main issues affecting christian lives in israel and palestine is the israelipalestinian conflict it is a persistent source of regional instability that fuels violence in various forms which kills many including christians rising religious and political extremism makes many of us feel like strangers in our own homeland economic deterioration and the declining number of people coming for pilgrimage in the holy land due to the conflict are leading to a loss of livelihood and worsening socioeconomic conditions widespread despair is driving many to emigrate or plan to leave in the near future dwindling the numbers of our community many local christians want the holy see to engage with key global and regional players to achieve a lasting solution to the israelipalestinian conflict in his last sermon pope francis spoke about the urgent need for peace in gaza in his first sermon pope leo xiv called for an immediate ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the strip we welcome these statements and hope he will continue to do his utmost to promote peace in the holy land in palestine the situation remains unclear due to the israeli occupation of all territories meant to form a palestinian state the ongoing war in gaza and the limited authority of the palestinian authority in the west bank — not to mention israel’s full annexation of east jerusalem this reality calls for thoughtful action by the church both at the level of the holy see and locally to provide people with hope in these dark times advertisement in israel there is a pressing need for cooperation between the holy see and the local church — bishops priests and believers — to resolve many issues that affect the christian and nonchristian communities it is crucial to work with all segments of the local society to pressure the state to treat all its citizens equally and preserve their dignity christians hope that the holy see can collaborate with us in our efforts to achieve equality we as a community face israeli laws that discriminate against us based on ethnicity and religion we need support in our efforts to have such laws repealed it is also essential to work towards resolving painful issues that have negatively impacted the christian presence such as the case of the villages of iqrit and biram whose catholic christian residents were expelled before their homes were destroyed by the israeli authorities in 1951 since then the residents and their descendants have been demanding to return to their ancestral lands but are being denied this right there is also a need for stronger intervention by the holy see to support christian institutions operating under israeli control which face growing challenges such as attempts by some municipalities to impose heavy taxes in violation of past agreements the clear discriminatory underfunding of christian schools by israeli authorities and threats against church property many christians of the holy land also hope that pope leo xiv will work to enhance unity among them including efforts to reach a unified date for major religious holidays especially christmas and easter they also call for increased joint efforts among churches to organise pilgrimages to the holy land that include not only visits to religious sites but also interactions with the faithful who live there this is important because it would help us raise global awareness about the challenges we face and feel an integral part of the universal church advertisement as a whole christians in the holy land like their fellow christians around the world desire to see a father in pope leo xiv — a father who visits them and welcomes their visits consults with them and listens to their concerns protects them from harm stands with them when they are attacked or oppressed and follows in the footsteps of the church’s founder who never hesitated to defend the oppressed regardless of how powerful the oppressor might be pope leo xiv should know that he has many children in the holy land who love him and understand how busy he and the holy see are with so many issues around the world in the holy land christians have prayed — and continue to pray — for his success in his mission fully aware of how complex it is but above all the children need their father — and that is what they expect the most that he will always stand by their side despite how busy he might be the views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect al jazeera’s editorial

administration helps broker a ceasefire united states president donald trump has offered to work with india and pakistan to achieve a “solution” for the longdisputed kashmir region days after his administration brokered a ceasefire between the two nucleararmed rivals “i will work with you both to see if after a ‘thousand years’ a solution can be arrived at concerning kashmir” trump posted on his truth social platform on sunday the us president doubled down on a historically inaccurate assertion that india and pakistan have been fighting for “a thousand years” or more the muslimmajority territory has been contested since the partition of british india in 1947 into india and pakistan the two countries have fought three wars over the region they both stake a claim over kashmir as a whole but control parts of it indiaadministered kashmir has seen decades of armed rebellion either for independence or a merger with pakistan new delhi has deployed more than 700000 soldiers to quash the rebellion the government of indian prime minister narendra modi has so far remained committed to a decadesold policy of refusing international mediation to find a solution to the kashmir issue in 2019 modi’s government stripped indiaadministered kashmir’s semiautonomy further alienating the kashmiris advertisement in its response pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement on sunday that it appreciates trump’s willingness to resolve the kashmir issue which has implications for peace and security in south asia and beyond “pakistan reaffirms that any just and lasting settlement of the jammu and kashmir dispute must be in accordance with the relevant united nations security council resolutions and must ensure the realization of the fundamental rights of the kashmiri people including their inalienable right to selfdetermination” it said india’s leaders have not directly commented but indian media quoted unnamed government sources as saying no decision has yet been made to engage in talks on anything beyond the ceasefire india and pakistan agreed to halt all fighting on saturday but trump was the first person to announce the deal on his online platform in his post on sunday trump took credit for the ceasefire “i am proud that the usa was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision” he wrote “while not even discussed i am going to increase trade substantially with both of these great nations” the latest fighting between the two neighbours started when india attacked pakistan in the aftermath of a shooting attack in indiaadministered kashmir’s pahalgam which killed 26 civilians at a tourist location new delhi again accused pakistan of backing the “terrorist” groups that have launched many deadly attacks in indiaadministered kashmir for decades advertisement pakistan strongly denies the charges maintaining that india has supported “terrorism” in its territory for many years and the pahalgam attack was a falseflag operation to start a war the missile drone and artillery attacks signified the most serious fighting between the two countries since they became nucleararmed powers decades ago ‘neutral’ site for talks us secretary of state marco rubio said on saturday that in addition to the ceasefire the two countries agreed to conduct broad talks over a host of issues at a “neutral” site soon pakistani prime minister shehbaz sharif on saturday said his country believes in the path of peaceful negotiations to resolve problems around distribution of water resources and “all issues including jammu and kashmir” but india has for decades refused to hold negotiations over the contested region as it has tried to strengthen its hold over it mohmad waseem malla a research fellow at the international centre for peace studies in new delhi told al jazeera that trump’s statement though not entirely surprising was “striking both in tone and substance” and likely to raise concerns in new delhi “any suggestion of thirdparty involvement even in passing crosses a red line for new delhi – especially under the current government which has redefined the country’s foreign policy and its emphasis on territorial sovereignty” advertisement he added that while trump’s mention of boosting trade and promoting peace may seem conciliatory internationally india’s domestic political climate and strategic priorities make it difficult to entertain such offers right now “the key will be how new delhi calibrates its response given current sensitivities” the two countries also have yet to resolve their differences over water distribution as india’s suspension of its participation in the indus waters treaty remains in place in response to the pahalgam attack india also expelled pakistani diplomats military advisers and visa holders closed its main land border crossing and suspended trade and launched a manhunt for the perpetrators pakistan responded by kicking out indian officials and citizens closing its airspace to indian flights and threatening to pull out of the simla agreement which underpins the line of control in kashmir,,,,,,,,Fresh

thursday was elected as the firstever usborn leader of the roman catholic church has a familial bloodline that reflects his homeland’s fraught relationship with race – and why the nation’s stature as a melting pot of origins has long endured records unearthed by genealogists show the maternal grandfather of 69yearold robert prevost the newly minted pope was evidently born abroad in santo domingo the capital of the dominican republic according to birth records that professional genealogist chris smothers cited to abc news in a recent report when leo’s grandfather joseph martinez obtained an 1887 marriage license to wed the future pope’s grandmother louise baquié he listed his birthplace as haiti which at the time was the same territory as santo domingo smothers noted baquié’s birth records meanwhile indicate that she was born in louisiana’s most prominent city new orleans to parents who were reportedly married at a local catholic church records from the 1900 census show that joseph – apparently the son of a louisianan – and louise lived at a home in new orleans’s seventh ward a bastion for the city’s creole people the couple’s home later was among hundreds that were demolished to make way for a highway overpass linking new orleans’s suburbs to its globally renowned french quarter a move that drastically reduced the area’s population and economically devastated the scores of black businesses that had been prevalent there those same census records identified leo’s maternal grandparents as black two of his aunts were similarly identified just about four years after the plessy v ferguson us supreme court case – which originated in new orleans – upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation in the country by 1920 the martinez family had moved north to chicago and away from the racially oppressive us south the future pope’s mother the chicagoborn mildred agnes martinez was eight at the time and the census that decade listed the martinezes as white it would not be until 1954 that the us supreme court would issue the ruling that overturned the plessy v ferguson precedent and deemed racial segregation unconstitutional – and even then many communities across the nation spent years flouting the decision multiple genealogists theorized that the martinezes may have strategically shifted their racial identity to assimilate in chicago which – though further north – has had its own history of discrimination and oppression on the basis of skin color “you can understand that people may have intentionally sought to obfuscate their heritage” jari honora a family historian for the historic new orleans collection told the associated press honora added that “always life has been precarious for people of color” mildred martinez eventually married louis marius prevost the librarian and her husband – a second world war veteran and educator – raised three sons in chicago the youngest robert was ordained a priest in 1982 became the worldwide leader of the catholic religious order colloquially known as the augustinians led a peruvian diocese was made a cardinal by pope francis in september 2023 and headed the vatican entity in charge of selecting new bishops around the world the us registered a recordsetting 478 million immigrants in 2023 threequarters of whom were naturalized citizens legal permanent residents or visa holders – all of whom buttressed the country’s centuriesold metaphorical reputation as a melting pot that status has come under threat when donald trump clinched a second us presidency the following year – and his administration mounted an immigration crackdown marked by steady news of detentions and deportations after he returned to the oval office in january leo’s fellow cardinals elected him to succeed the late francis after a twoday conclave that concluded less than four months into trump’s second presidency and one of leo’s older brothers suburban chicago resident and retired catholic school principal john prevost quickly told the new york times “i know he’s not happy with what’s going on with immigration” social media users just as rapidly flocked to an account seemingly belonging to leo and noted how it had demonstrated a willingness to be critical of the administration’s positions one of the account’s entries reposted an article about catholic bishops in california who attributed “racism and nativism” to trump’s use of the phrase “bad hombres” for certain mexicans it wasn’t immediately clear how much leo might be a foil to the chief executive of the global superpower from which he hails among other issues confronting the pope and there is no indication leo has ever publicly discussed his racial identity much john prevost for his part told the times that his brothers did not discuss their louisiana roots he also said his immediate family did not identify as black a vatican news release said leo’s father was of french and italian descent it said the pope’s mother was of spanish ancestry whatever the case loyola marymount university professor kim r harris who teaches african american religious thought and practice remarked to the ap that she hopes leo’s papacy “brings to light who we are as americans and who we are as a people of the diaspora” “when i think about a person who brings so much of the history of this country in his bones” harris said “it brings a whole new perspective and widens the vision of who we all are”,,,,,,,,Fresh

A0784,2025-05-11,1,Australia’s rental crisis is not what you think it is,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/12/australias-rental-crisis-is-not-what-you-think-it-is,footage of long queues at the doors of properties for lease has become a regular feature of property reporting over the past few years landlords have upped their asking rents by double digits ahead of last weekend’s election the greens campaigned hard for rent freezes to stop the “unlimited rent increases” they claimed the major parties tacitly supported there have been horror stories of single parents struggling to find an affordable home while a lack of housing plagues residents in disasterstricken towns such as lismore yet the rental crisis is not what you think it is that’s because for the vast majority of renting households it’s not a crisis at all ben phillips an associate professor at the australian national university centre for social research and methods says talk of a national rental crisis is “overblown” phillips says much of the media attention has been focused on the rapid rise in advertised rents which peaked at well over 15 in 2024 according to property research firm corelogic that’s the fastest annual rate on record according to this data stretching back about two decades and since the end of 2019 this measure of rents has climbed by nearly 50 but phillips a member of the albanese government’s economic inclusion advisory committee which has advocated for a major lift in the jobseeker payment says these online advertised rents are only a small and unrepresentative share of the total rental market they reflect how difficult and pricey it is to move rentals or rent for the first time what they don’t reflect is how much most of the roughly 3 million households with a lease are actually paying and there the picture is very different the most comprehensive database on rents paid is produced by the australian bureau of statistics as part of its consumer price index or cpi which measures inflation series the abs each month tracks rental rates for about 600000 properties or nearly one in three leased homes and by this measure rents have climbed by 19 in just over five years or less than half the corelogic reported rate that’s not nothing but it is two percentage points less than the overall increase in the cpi over that same period in other words rents have been a drag on overall inflation michael fotheringham the managing director of the australian housing and urban research institute says phillips’ analysis is right the corelogic rental data “show a more inflamed market than abs data and that’s because a significant proportion of renters are in a stable situation” fotheringham says “they have been in that property for more than a year and have a landlord who is not looking to jack up rents whenever they can” he says on the other hand there are also renters who are struggling to find a property at a time when the national vacancy rate is at a record low of 1 – as it has been for the past two years – against a more typical rate of 25 “they are both correct the two sets of data but they are talking about different things” that said fotheringham says there is a “fundamental problem with the word ‘crisis’” the problems in the housing market have not appeared suddenly like a natural disaster he says and an emergency response is not the way to fix the problems that ail the housing market “we have a badly broken housing system that we have been sleepwalking into for 40 years we need long slow multifaceted programs it’s taken decades to get us into this mess and it won’t be fixed by christmas” phillips in the unreleased research paper australian rental cost trends says the confusion over how much rental prices have increased boils down to the difference between the “stock” of properties versus the “flow” of properties “economists often make this distinction using a bath tub analogy” he writes “a small flow of hot water new rent data makes little difference to a much colder and larger stock of water in the bath all rents in the market” averages can hide a multitude of sins but phillips says the albanese government’s boosts to rental assistance and parenting payments have helped cushion the impact of higher rents on lower income households “there are people who are struggling but the talk of a generalised rental crisis is overblown” he says phillips’ analysis shows that rental affordability has actually improved over the past decade with renters’ incomes rising faster than rents despite a recent uptick he estimates that rental costs as a share of renters’ incomes have dropped “fairly substantially” from 28 in 2013 to 26 now similarly a little over one in five renting adults in 2023 reported at least three forms of financial stress – a threshold for severe pressure according to the latest hilda survey that’s a lot but it’s not much changed from the recent low of one in six in 2021 and it’s about the same as the 15year average,,,,,,,,Fresh

A0789,2025-05-11,1,Zelenskyy challenges Putin to meet in person for peace talks,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/11/ukraine-ready-meet-russia-only-ceasefire-agreed-zelenskky,volodymyr zelenskyy has challenged vladimir putin to meet in person for peace talks in istanbul on thursday and urged russia to accept a 30day truce in a dramatic turn after a weekend of diplomatic flurry his comments came after donald trump pressed him to agree “immediately” to putin’s offer of negotiations this week with russia zelenskyy upped the stakes by suggesting the enemies meet “personally” “we await a full and lasting ceasefire starting from tomorrow to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy” the ukrainian president said in a statement “there is no point in prolonging the killings and i will be waiting for putin in türkiye on thursday personally i hope that this time the russians will not look for excuses” the two leaders have not communicated directly since russia launched its fullscale invasion of ukraine and there have been no publicly known talks between moscow and kyiv since march 2022 shortly after the war began zelenskyy’s statement came shortly after trump had told kyiv to agree to putin’s call for direct talks next week with ukraine sidelining a carefully orchestrated europeanled movement to force the russian leader to sign up to a 30day ceasefire trump said in a statement on his truth social platform that ukraine should “have the meeting now” he said “president putin of russia doesn’t want to have a cease fire agreement with ukraine but rather wants to meet on thursday in turkey to negotiate a possible end to the bloodbath ukraine should agree to this immediately at least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible and if it is not european leaders and the us will know where everything stands and can proceed accordingly” the demand for a 30day ceasefire was set out on saturday during a visit to kyiv by the leaders of britain france germany and poland who together with zelenskyy made a phone call to trump before holding a joint press conference britain’s keir starmer said that if putin rejected the offer “we will respond working with president trump with all our partners we will ramp up sanctions and increase our military aid for ukraine’s defence to pressure russia back to the table” 053 european leaders call for unconditional 30day ceasefire in ukraine – video putin’s response to the ultimatum came in the unusual form of a statement read out to journalists in a ceremonial kremlin room at close to 2am local time he accused ukraine of breaking previous ceasefires but said that “despite this” he was suggesting the two parties meet for talks which he said could take place in istanbul this thursday he did not say who would attend though observers widely expected him to send his top diplomatic aides “we are ready for serious talks with ukraine and we want to solve the root causes of the conflict” he said putin’s tone appeared carefully calibrated to reject europe’s demands but also make moscow appear to be playing constructively in the eyes of the trump administration which has tended to be much softer on moscow than on kyiv until recent days putin made a point of thanking the new us administration for its efforts to resolve the conflict trump’s response suggests the tactic may have succeeded delivering a significant blow to western unity as washington is now putting pressure on kyiv to enter into talks with moscow in turkey – even as russia continues its assault on the country in his truth social post on sunday trump hinted at the frustration he has reportedly expressed in private in recent days over moscow’s hardline demands in the war in ukraine “i’m starting to doubt that ukraine will make a deal with putin who’s too busy celebrating the victory of world war ii which could not have been won not even close without the united states of america” he wrote by proposing a direct meeting with putin in istanbul zelenskyy appears to be seizing the initiative putting pressure back on the russian leader – who rarely travels spontaneously – to either attend or back down earlier on sunday in a post on x zelenskyy had said “there is no point in continuing the killing even for a single day we expect russia to confirm a ceasefire – full lasting and reliable – starting tomorrow may 12 and ukraine is ready to meet” his chief of staff andriy yermak put it more succinctly “first a 30day ceasefire then everything else” 104 putin says russia wants serious negotiations with ukraine – video the french president emmanuel macron had written on x on sunday morning that no talks would be possible until putin agreed to the ceasefire “there can be no negotiations while weapons are speaking there can be no dialogue if at the same time civilians are being bombed” he wrote the flurry of backandforth offers and ultimatums suggests fastmoving diplomacy around the conflict but behind the rhetoric it is not clear how much of the fundamental positions of the two sides have changed ukraine and its european allies want a full ceasefire after which negotiations would start on a comprehensive settlement including a european “reassurance force” inside ukraine the exact composition and duties of which are still under discussion among allies,,,,,,,,Fresh

of bribery and corruption as well as commensurate criticism a statement from qatar on sunday acknowledged it had held discussions with the us about “the possible transfer” of a plane to be used temporarily by trump as his presidential aircraft usurping air force one but the emirate’s statement denied a final decision over the transfer had been made – or that it was a gift on sunday citing multiple sources familiar with the matter abc reported that the trump administration was girding itself to accept a luxury boeing 7478 a jumbo jet from the qatari royals that was estimated to be about 400m trump would then use the 13yearold plane as the new air force one until shortly before the conclusion of his second oval office stint at which point it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation no later than 1 january 2029 the luxury gift from qatar was expected to be announced next week during trump’s threeday tour of the middle east that includes saudi arabia the united arab emirates and qatar abc reported yet a qatari spokesperson said it was “inaccurate” to say that the jet would be gifted “during the upcoming visit of president trump” trump toured the opulent plane in february while it was parked at the west palm beach international airport abc added assuming trump accepts the plane as planned the jumbo jet would first be transferred to the us air force so the military branch could configure the aircraft to meet the specifications required for presidential travel abc’s sources told the network the network added that any costs affiliated with its transfer would be paid for by the us air force which receives a significant portion of the revenue generated by federal taxpayers according to abc’s sources trump’s attorney general pam bondi and his top white house lawyer david warrington have preemptively concluded that it is “legally permissible” for trump to accept the luxury gift and then transfer it over to his presidential library both reportedly arrived at that conclusion after lawyers for the white house counsel’s office as well as the justice department said the gifted plane was not conditioned on any official act and therefore was not bribery those lawyers drafted an analysis for defense secretary pete hegseth which reiterated that nothing about the plane violated federal laws prohibiting us government officials accepting gifts from foreign states or their royals in fact abc’s sources said bondi’s reading of the situation was that the plane was being given to the us air force and then trump’s presidential library foundation rather than her boss himself nevertheless reports of the highly unusual – if not unprecedented – gift that trump’s subordinates had afforded their blessing for him to receive triggered a wave of criticisms towards the president the democratic senator chuck schumer quickly mocked trump’s political slogan of “america first” “nothing says ‘america first’ like air force one brought to you by qatar” the us senate minority leader from new york said in a statement “it’s not just bribery – it’s premium foreign influence with extra legroom” on x democratic congressman jamie raskin of maryland said “trump must seek congress’ consent to take this 300m from qatar the constitution is perfectly clear no present of any kind whatever’ from a foreign state without congressional permission a gift you use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift and a grift” democratic pollster matt mcdermott echoed similar sentiments saying “literally speechless… “a foreign regime gifting a jet to a former president it’s bribery in broad daylight” mcdermott remarked that the trump organization run by the president’s children only days earlier had announced a new 55bn golf course in qatar “today qatar ‘gifts’ trump a luxury jet surely just a coincidence” mcdermott said meanwhile harvard university international security professor juliette kayyem said “the surveillance and security aspects are also as disturbing as the grift” the cnn security analyst added that “qatar will surely offer a plane that satisfies their needs as well” cnn medical analyst jonathan reiner took to x and said “air force one is a checks notes air force plane a military aircraft it’s not intended to be a palace because the us doesn’t have a king” similarly new york times reporter maggie haberman and prolific trump scoopster wrote that the plane in question was “likely the most expensive gift from a foreign government in us history and will likely raise questions from legal experts” she added “if trump continued using it out of office it would give him access to a much more modern plane than trump force one” which is a private boeing 757 built in 1991 that belongs to the organization run by his sons,,,,,,,,Fresh
A0793,2025-05-11,1,Trump to embark on Middle East trip to meet Gulf allies,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/trump-middle-east-gulf-israel,donald trump this week will embark on the first foreign trip of his second administration with a tour of the middle east as he looks to secure investment trade and technology deals from friendly leaders with deep pockets amid turbulent negotiations around numerous regional conflicts including israel’s war in gaza the tour through the middle east is largely a repeat of his first international trip in 2017 when he was feted in the region as a transactional leader eager to secure quick wins and capable of providing support for the regional monarchies’ economic and geopolitical interests his negotiations in saudi arabia qatar and the united arab emirates will focus on a number of topics including oil and trade investment deals the regional conflicts in israelgaza and yemen and negotiations over the iran nuclear programme among other issues but trump’s key goal is to come out of the region saying that he put america first say observers “i think what he’s clearly looking to get out of this is deals the announcement of multiple multibillion dollar deals” said steven a cook the senior fellow for middle east and africa studies at the council on foreign relations “the president’s approach to foreign policy is heavily influenced by … his version of economic statecraft which is to look towards the wealthy states in the gulf and their very large sovereign wealth funds as sources of investment in the united states” he said trump has already announced saudi arabia’s commitment to invest 1tn into the us economy and is hoping to secure bigticket investments on monday’s visit that would be consistent with his america first policy of prioritising domestic interests cook said those countries may also seek access to advanced us semiconductor exports and saudi arabia will want to ink a deal on civilian nuclear infrastructure which had previously been tied to the country’s normalisation of relations with israel in a departure from previous policy the trump administration has indicated the two issues are no longer linked the middle east trip is notable for the us president’s lack of plans to visit israel where benjamin netanyahu and his cabinet have floated plans to launch a larger invasion of gaza and expel the palestinian population there in what critics have called a broad plan of ethnic cleansing the israelgaza war will loom large over the negotiations as saudi arabia has said it will not normalise relations with israel unless there is a clear path to a twostate solution and many countries in the middle east have spoken out against a proposal that began with trump to expel palestinian from gaza to other arab countries “he could have gone to israel like he did last time” said elliot abrams former deputy national security advisor under president george w bush and a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations he added that pete hegseth the defense secretary had cancelled a planned trip to israel “i think there’s some tension here … israel knows that trump is going to be spending a week in the gulf hearing about gaza gaza gaza gaza every day so it’s not the best moment in usisrael or trumpisrael relations” there is a growing understanding in washington and israel that trump has taken a step back from attempting to mediate the war in gaza his administration said that they would negotiate a new aid deal without the direct involvement of the israeli government to renew deliveries of aid into gaza which is suffering its worst humanitarian crisis of the war since a ceasefire collapsed in march “he’s the only one who speaks the same language as netanyahu and he’s the only one who can speak to netanyahu in a language that netanyahu will understand” said ami ayalon a former director of the israel security agency also known as the shin bet “trump again when it comes to to the hostages when it comes to our relations in the palestinians has become the center of everything in the middle east” he said that turns trump’s attention to the things he can get done he has said that he plans to decide on his trip to saudi arabia on an announcement that the us could refer to the arabian gulf or the gulf of arabia rather than the persian gulf that has angered iran at a moment when the gulf states appear largely in support of us efforts in talks on the future of the iranian nuclear programme as opposed to 2017 the gulf states have largely spoken in support of renewed negotiations between the united states and iran over the nuclear programme but those governments were said to be unclear on the details of any deal as of yet “us partners have confided to me that there are us statements on all of these issues but they don’t yet see us policies” said jon alterman director of the middle east program at csis a thinktank “the us government doesn’t speak with one voice and its actions remain uncoordinated” in saudi arabia trump has enlisted his soninlaw jared kushner to act as a point man for the discussions ahead of the trip cnn has reported kushner who was trump’s envoy to the region during his first administration is said to be tasked with making progress in discussions of saudi arabia joining the abraham accords but his role is also tainted by a perceived conflictofinterest given his family’s business interests in the region yet with such a complicated tableau of economic and geopolitical interests in the region there are questions about whether the trump administration has the focus and the team to pursue a comprehensive policy in the region many in trump’s orbit say that us policy should place lower priority on the middle east and focus instead on china and the indopacific region “i think the sense that there’s these pieces that the president is negotiating don’t respond together and that his priority really is essentially domestic focus securing you know agreements to invest in the estates” said cook “regionally the president would like these issues to go away and that’s why he has these compressed timelines he doesn’t want to focus on”,,,,,,,,Fresh

Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/11/there-is-suffering-everywhere-you-look-says-mother-of-emaciated-baby-girl-trapped-in-gaza,siwar ashour was born into war and hunger and has known nothing else she is now in real danger of dying without ever having known a moment of peace or contentment the sixmonthold palestinian girl whose painfully emaciated body symbolised the deliberate starvation of gaza when she appeared on the bbc this week was only 25kg when she was born on 20 november last year from birth siwar had a problem with her oesophagus that has made it hard for her to drink breast milk and left her dependent on specialised formula which is in critically short supply her parents’ home in alnuseirat halfway up the coast on the gaza strip was bombed earlier in the war which began in october 2023 when hamas killed 1200 people in israel leading to an israeli assault that has so far killed more than 52000 people in gaza they lived in tents for a while but it was almost impossible to get food or water in the camp and it also came under israeli fire they tried going back to alnuseirat to stay at siwar’s grandparents’ home but that was bombed too all that was left of the building was a single room which they shared with 11 other people that was where siwar was born view image in fullscreen siwar has struggled to breastfeed and is unable to tolerate many different kinds of formula photograph anadolugetty images “i was exhausted all the time there was no privacy and i couldn’t get any rest” najwa aram siwar’s 23yearold mother said “there was no food or proper nutrition and when i gave birth to her she was not like other babies” “when she was born she was beautiful despite the weakness visible on her features” she said “but now she is unnaturally thin babies her age are supposed to weigh six kilograms6kg or more – not just 2 to 4kg” najwa found out last month she was pregnant with her second child but lives in terror of losing siwar before her brother or sister is born she has moved to khan younis to stay with her mother but has spent most of the past few months in hospital with her frail daughter her husband saleh is blind and had to stay behind in alnuseirat the relentless bombing has forced the family to move several times like almost all families in gaza and has torn them apart “even though siwar’s father is blind he used to play with her a lot he visited us in the hospital only once as he cannot move without someone accompanying him” najwa said “he fears for her even more than i do – he is deeply attached to her” the family has no source of income so relies on charity kitchens for food and some humanitarian aid but that too is in desperately short supply as israel’s total blockade of gaza approaches the 70day mark philippe lazzarini the head of the un relief agency unrwa said this week “the manmade and politically motivated starvation in gaza is an expression of absolute cruelty” najwa and her mother have a single sack of flour left as well as a few tins “once this runs out we won’t be able to buy anything due to the high prices” najwa said even more critically supplies of the special milk formula that siwar needs are harder and harder to find “i am also suffering from malnutrition still i try to breastfeed siwar but she refuses and continues to cry completely rejecting me” najwa said “that’s why i’ve had to rely more on formula milk when i used to breastfeed her one can of formula would last a month now it runs out in less than a week” najwa and her daughter spent much of march in hospital in deir albalah where there was a milk formula that seemed to work bringing siwar’s weight up to 4kg “i noticed that siwar started to smile and play which made me happy and gave me hope that her health might improve” but that fragile moment of hope crumbled when they were discharged and siwar started losing weight again she was referred to nasser hospital in khan younis where mother and daughter remain for now “the doctors are doing everything they can to take care of her but she also doesn’t tolerate the formula they prepare for her” najwa said “the hospital situation is bad there are six patients in each room everywhere you look there is suffering there’s a child in worse condition than siwar” “seeing my daughter in this state every day gives me insomnia” she said “i’m constantly anxious and overthinking sometimes i can’t bear seeing her like this and i start crying i’m so afraid of losing her can’t the world open the crossings to allow in milk food and medicine all i want is for my daughter siwar to live like the rest of the children in the world” dr ahmed alfarah the director of the children’s and maternity building at the nasser medical complex said between five and 10 new malnutrition cases are being recorded there every day “we’re seeing severe cases malnutrition appears in children in a horrifying and extremely visible way” farah said “we have nothing to offer them they need proteins but there are none we try to provide a little milk perhaps powdered milk but we can’t offer anything more “on top of that the severe overcrowding in hospitals leads to increased disease transmission among children” he added there is only enough fuel left at the nasser complex to keep the generators going for another 48 hours they have already had to shut off electricity on the administrative floors to make it last a little bit longer but the power supply will soon have to be cut to the overcrowded patients’ wards “we are helpless in the face of their needs – we cannot provide food supplements medication or vitamins appropriate for their conditions” the doctor said “i studied malnutrition in medical school textbooks i used to think that study would remain theoretical something we’d never see in real life but now those textbook descriptions have come to life before our eyes in gaza” farah said “i call on the world to see us as human beings – we

Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/11/india-and-pakistan-both-claim-victory-after-ceasefire-declared,india and pakistan have both claimed victory after a ceasefire was declared over the weekend which brought the two nuclearnations back from the brink of war after days of escalating clashes that culminated in both sides launching missile and drone strikes on each other’s major military bases – the closest they had come to fullscale war in decades – the ceasefire between india and pakistan was declared by donald trump on saturday evening on sunday trump further congratulated the two countries on “having the strength wisdom and fortitude to fully know and understand that it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many and so much” within hours of the truce announcement there were fears it had fallen apart after firing restarted along the disputed border in kashmir and missiles and drones were once again launched into indianadministered kashmir however by sunday morning things were quiet on both sides of the frontier leading many to hope the fragile peace would hold each side accused the other of triggering the violations and pakistan said it remained “committed to faithful implementation of ceasefire” the indian army said in a press briefing it had conveyed a message through its “hotline” with pakistan that if there were any more crossborder provocations “our firm and clear intent to respond to these fiercely” both india and pakistan claimed the ceasefire as a victory fuelling a surge of nationalistic fervour on both sides of the border india’s defence minister rajnath singh said on sunday the “roar of indian forces reached rawalpindi the very headquarters of the pakistani army” he said the military offensive named operation sindoor was “not just a military action but a symbol of india’s political social and strategic willpower” in pakistan parades were held near the border to shower the military with petals and the prime minister shehbaz sharif declared 11 may to be a day “in recognition of the armed forces’ response to recent indian aggression” writing in pakistan’s dawn newspaper commentator baqir sajjad called the ceasefire a “calculated victory” by pakistan that “firmly denied a much stronger india the military edge and diplomatic narrative it sought to dominate” parties and rallies were held across the country to mark the day particularly in pakistancontrolled kashmir which was on the frontline of weeks of aggressive crossborder shelling raja farooq haider khan a former leader of pakistancontrolled kashmir led a celebratory rally near the disputed kashmir border “we are celebrating the bravery of our armed forces today who defended us” he said he offered his gratitude to trump for helping to resolve the conflict “this time we were so close to war so his involvement was very welcome but we have to say that without resolving the kashmir issue longterm peace can’t prevail in the region” sahad a resident in neelum valley in pakistancontrolled kashmir said the past few days had been the scariest of her life “no one can be happier than us as we live under the shadow of border posts and indian firings everyone is happy to have our normal lives back” she said there were also celebrations on the indian side of the border however residents near the disputed frontier said that while a ceasefire was welcome it did not solve the underlying problem of the often bloody dispute between india and pakistan over the himalayan region of kashmir which goes back to the partition of india in 1947 lal din 55 a resident of poonch the worstaffected area along india’s border in kashmir where hundreds of houses were destroyed and dozens killed in the crossborder fire said kashmiris has seen this same situation – “temporary ceasefires brokered by global powers” – many times before “the core issue remains unresolved – soldiers still face each other with weapons and tanks” he said “today it was one dispute tomorrow it will be another and the guns will roar again trapping civilians like me in the crossfire we’re just numbers in this clash of nuclear powers i beg both sides resolve your differences live in peace and let us live” after weeks of mounting tensions the attacks this week began on wednesday when indian missiles struck nine sites in pakistan killing 31 people india has said those strikes were aimed at “terrorist infrastructure and terrorist training camps” as retribution for an attack in indianadministered kashmir late last month in which militants killed 25 hindu tourists and a guide which it blamed on pakistanibacked extremists the situation escalated further after india accused pakistan of two consecutive nights of drone attacks the us took sizeable credit for brokering saturday’s ceasefire with marco rubio the secretary of state and jd vance the vicepresident reported to have spent 48 hours embroiled in intense diplomatic negotiations with the two countries finally convincing them to lay down arms on saturday other countries including saudi arabia and the uk were also credited vance had initially said the us would not interfere in the escalating hostilities between the us and pakistan claiming it was “none of our business” however according to sources their attitude shifted after concerns were raised by us intelligence that the conflict posed a risk of escalating into a full nuclear threat the reportedly proactive role played by the us in the ceasefire including phone calls made by trump himself seemed to have piqued the president’s interest in the subcontinent and he pledged to substantially increase trade with both india and pakistan at a press briefing on sunday indian military spokespeople offered more details on its offensive against pakistan and claimed it was pakistan that had first requested a ceasefire india said five of its soldiers were killed by pakistani firing over the border and claimed pakistan lost about 40 solders in firing along the line of control it also claimed to have killed 100 terrorists living over the border in pakistan the numbers could not be verified it also claimed to have “downed a few pakistani planes” though it did not elaborate further asked about claims made by pakistan and backed up by expert analysis of debris that pakistani missiles had downed at least three indian military jets during the offensive on wednesday including multimilliondollar french rafale jets india said “losses are a part of conflict” and that all its

a recent surge in support for reform uk the prime minister will say on monday that overseas arrivals should commit “to learning our language” and will promise to overhaul a “broken system” that encourages businesses to “bring in lowerpaid workers” the government will also end the right of foreign workers to automatically apply for settlement in the uk after five years instead extending their wait to a 10year requirement the prime minister will say the announcements are part of labour’s longawaited white paper on immigration to be put before parliament on monday and follow the electoral

their dependants will be expected to pass the more advanced english a2 test if they apply for settlement they will be expected to pass a b2 exam which requires them to understand “complex text on both

drivers earning an average of nearly £70000 a year going on strike to demand more and they don’t even have to steer but if it really is such a cushy number why doesn’t britain have enough drivers – and what does it take to join their ranks driver shortages have become a leading cause of disruption on britain’s railways about seven out of eight “pcoded” cancellations made the night before travel are down to a missing driver parts of the timetable still rely on drivers working voluntary overtime also looming is a potential mass exodus with thousands of drivers recruited in boom years now approaching retirement that prompted the government to announce this week that it was changing the rules to allow 18yearolds to start driving trains – two years younger than the current legal minimum but as recent job adverts for northern railway show driving may not be quite the money for old rope that headlines sometimes imply the training salary of £26000 rises to £62000 in three years but the attributes required include “diligence and moral courage” “zero tolerance for drugs and alcohol” and “exceptional concentration skills within a lowstimulus environment” not to mention 3am starts still the department for transport wants at least 5000 more drivers and hopes that gen z will help them meet that target according to the dft nearly half of qualified drivers are over the age of 50 while only 3 are under 30 in the east midlands railway emr training centre at the back of derby train station the new recruits are typically later life career changers including some who work in different roles in the railway “we have a lot of expolice exfire brigade who tend to like the rules and regulations” says mark letman emr’s lead operations training manager and himself exarmy he oversees 50 to 60 trainees a year starting with an 18week intensive theory course on the drivers’ rulebook tim joyce 53 is retraining after 30 years in the fire service of his new life he says “it’s similar in many ways – you have to learn the rules but ultimately be ready to apply them in the real world” he shows his copy of the rulebook known as “the brick” or “the bible” a hefty tome generously bookmarked with multicoloured labels “these modules are up to 100 pages each and there are maybe 40 of them” joyce says letman picks up the brick and counts through “twentyone” either way it looks heavy for a driver to have to lug around every day “he carries it between his ears” letman says tapping his head with a look that suggests this guardian correspondent will never be a train driver view image in

through two rounds of interviews as well as psychometric tests – on which the failure rate alone is 60 to 70 the exam on the rulebook requires a 90 score to pass and driver competency is checked every two years drivers have to live near a depot and travel there and back when other public transport is probably unavailable that means most are recruited locally – though in emr’s case that can be london as well as boston anita bradfield 60 is in training to work out of st pancras having already swapped a career in dancing to work for network rail as a mobile operations manager “i’d go out to assist drivers and be seeing them every day – i thought it’d be good to have a go’ she says “it’s a challenge and good learning no day is ever the same” if the trainees pass the theory exam they go on to what letman calls the “traction phase” learning the nuts and bolts of train driving in class and using a new £15m simulator only then are they sent to the depot with a mentor and instructors to rack up 200 hours of driving under instruction before being let loose alone with passengers the whole process takes at least eight months among the emr trainees charlie potts at 22 is part of the more elusive demographic the industry is chasing having decided after a geography and urban planning degree to listen to his old man “my dad was a train driver – and he always talked it up” school leavers without such connections could now be persuaded letman says “the good thing now is we can go into schools and say it could be a career now for life” skip past newsletter promotion sign up to headlines

according to aslef the train drivers union the average entry age is 34 which mick whelan the general secretary says “concerns us massively” few women in particular he says want to change careers at that point in life view image in fullscreen the transport secretary heidi alexander visits a train driver training facility in derby photograph joe giddenspa one of those trying the emr simulators though not yet aiming to switch jobs was the transport secretary heidi alexander “the driver shortage problem is a genuine problem across the uk” she said “especially in parts of the country strangely where we’re trying hardest to improve services like the northeast” the new age rules alexander said were only “part of the puzzle” but could make a big difference “giving young people when they’re leaving school or college the ability to go straight into training to be a driver instead of having to worry what they’re going to do for a couple of years is really significant” the pandemic exacerbated the shortage of drivers covidera regulations halted training and many drivers also sought a better worklife balance fewer passengers and lower fare revenue also left the government underwriting train companies leaving a cashstrapped sector freezing pay strikes ensued and a loss of goodwill persists much of the railway relies on restday working or voluntary overtime and in many places drivers no longer fancy it but there is still demand for jobs whelan says “we’ve seen places like wales recently advertise drivers’ jobs and they’ve been inundated” so why can’t we recruit more “it’s the hurdles” whelan says “it’s an illogical job when you think about it sitting in a little can working at 120 miles an hour relying on the infrastructure below you and pressing a little handle to stop at a point three miles away you can’t see people keep making out if you drive a bus drive a car you can drive a train you can’t” aslef continues to campaign for what it calls “dignity at work” while passenger carriages airconditioning and seats have been refurbished drivers have sometimes been left in old cabs drivers also have to cope with sparse toilet facilities in one tragic case in 2022 a driver was killed by another train after accident investigators believe stopping in a siding to urinate and whelan says “people forget it’s shift work when you’re walking down a siding at 320am in the rain to get a train ready and it’s freezing cold it’s not quite as pretty as when you’re rolling into a station in the sunlight”,,,,,,,,Fresh
A0811,2025-05-11,1,UK interest rate cut may not be enough to improve voters’ dim view of the government | Heather Stewart,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/11/uk-interest-rate-voters-inflation-wage-demands,the return of spring weather across much of the uk last week brought some rare glimmers of sunshine for the uk’s struggling economy too – including a confidenceboosting interest rate cut with hopes of more to come and as keir starmer hopes to seal a closer trading relationship with the eu he is urging voters to look “forward not back” yet even if some consumers start to feel the clouds are parting it is unlikely to come soon enough to improve voters’ dim view of the government as displayed in the local elections that may take a more radical rethink the bank of england’s interest rate decision on thursday was welcome though less than wholehearted with two of the monetary policy committee’s mpc nine members preferring no change though another two wanted a bumper halfpoint cut the committee’s more cautious members appear to have been restrained by fears of the dreaded secondround effects these can translate a shortterm inflationary surge such as the one now coming our way as a result of rising utility bills into a longerlasting crisis workers respond to price rises by bidding up their wages the theory goes that means higher labour costs for firms which then pass these on to consumers in the form of higher prices – and so it goes on yet much of the mpc’s narrative last week seemed to cut against this picture of the world for one thing a wave of inflationbusting pay rises seems a stretch in the current labour market which has now been slowing for months neither does the chancellor seem likely to sign off on a big increase for public sector workers consumers scarred by the savage runup in bills in 2022 and 2023 may well have high inflation expectations then but it seems questionable whether they will be able to translate them into chunky pay rises secondly while donald trump’s tariffs are likely to be painfully inflationary for american consumers the impact on the uk the bank judges will be modestly slower growth and weaker inflation the latter is because of lower global oil prices already flowing through to the uk’s petrol pumps and the likelihood that some cheap chinese goods previously destined for the us will find their way here in other words while the bank is nervous about a fresh wave of inflation existence later in the year there are reasons to think that will not happen it may take some months for the fog to clear but by the summer the worst fears of the mpc hawks may have lifted opening the way for the bank to respond to flatlining growth in the standard way with a run of quickfire rate cuts – a “dovish pivot” as analysts oxford economics put it despite the bleak global backdrop it seems just possible that by the time rachel reeves delivers her second budget a combination of lower mortgage costs cheaper petrol and bargain chinese imports may have helped to lighten the consumer mood meanwhile investor confidence another magic ingredient for recovery may be helped at the margin by the ukindia trade deal announced last week and the conclusion of negotiations with trump which resulted in swingeing

what it takes to alleviate the need for cumbersome veterinary checks at the border for example all of this incremental economic progress some of it achieved through hard yards of negotiation is well worth having and suits the starmer government’s preferred mode of governing sensible and dogged yet even if it bears fruit which it should over time it seems unlikely to dislodge the sense laid down with voters early in labour’s time in power that its definition of “economic stability” is “more cuts” some of that critique is unfair reeves is right to say her inheritance from the tories was grim she increased taxes by a stonking £30bn in last year’s budget to fund public services and has flexed the fiscal rules to allow a planned £100bn in additional public investment comparisons with george osborne are clearly wide of the mark but the determination to demonstrate labour’s seriousness – to voters and the markets – has resulted in some deeply unpopular policies including the welfare reforms that ended up being the centrepiece of her spring statement and the cut to winter fuel allowance wellsourced reports that the winter fuel cut could be partially reversed were ultimately knocked down by downing street last week but the fact the idea was being floated underlines how much pressure reeves is under mps campaigning in the local elections reported winter fuel and personal independence payments coming up repeatedly as reasons for voters’ disillusionment with labour which had promised them “change” even if there is no softening of either of these controversial policies then it is hard to imagine the political mood would now allow reeves to come back in the autumn with deep cuts if as the gloomy national institute of economic and social research suggested last week her fiscal plans are way off course ultimately even if the bank sweeps in with more growthboosting rate cuts it may be labour’s tax pledges with which reeves is so closely associated that have to give

A0814,2025-05-11,1,"After Blair’s bombshell, will Labour stick with or abandon net zero?",The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/may/11/will-labour-stick-with-or-abandon-net-zero,populist politicians are striking a chord with the public in their attack on “the green agenda” because they are right – climate policies are elitist so says the man standing to be the next leader of the green party in england and wales “we should all be angry about net zero” argues zack polanski currently the greens’ deputy leader “the poorest people in our society are being expected to step up to tackle the climate crisis but it’s the government’s fault not the people’s fault” a cautious approach to net zero is inviting populist opposition polanski argues instead we need greater government intervention and an antipoverty agenda tax the rich he urges to produce the funds needed to shift to a lowcarbon economy clean up rivers and restore nature “these problems are the result of political choices and we can make different political choices” he says it’s populism but in his view genuinely for the people and the planet ecopopulism polanski has stirred debate at a time when green policies are under attack in various countries most notably in donald trump’s america in britain too net zero has become a flashpoint last week reform uk took a record number of seats in the local elections the rightwing populist party’s energy spokesperson richard tice attacks “net stupid zero” at every opportunity and its leader nigel farage has warned council officials who work on climate change to look for new jobs just before the elections a fracas erupted in labour over incendiary remarks from tony blair appearing to attack the position taken on net zero by ed miliband the energy secretary and keir starmer it had all looked very different just a fortnight ago on 24 april a week before the local elections starmer took on his world statesman role greeting leaders and highranking ministers from 60 countries for an energy security summit at lancaster house “we will make energy a source not of vulnerability but of strength energy security is national security” he said “homegrown clean energy is the only way to take back control of our energy system deliver energy security and bring down bills for the long term that is in the dna of my government” it was intended to be a landmark speech miliband had been facing unfriendly briefings from within the party some thought to have come from blair as well as from the rightwing press which is relentless in its opposition to net zero and to miliband himself starmer’s unmistakeable gesture of support left miliband beaming what starmer did not know however was that while he was greeting ministers from around the world his trusted adviser and predecessor as prime minister blair was putting the finishing touches to an intervention of his own the next week blair’s bombshell hit in the foreword to a report calling for more investment in nuclear power and carbon capture and storage he wrote “voters feel they’re being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal … any strategy based on either ‘phasing out’ fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail” view image in fullscreen ed miliband and keir starmer at the energy security summit last month photograph toby melvillepa in contrast to the meagre attention devoted to starmer’s speech the remarks of blair – who left power 18 years ago and has welldocumented links to middle east petrostates – made an immediate splash the conservatives seized on the row with delight reform has been jubilant farage announced this week that reform councillors would refuse training on net zero tice vowed to oppose renewable energy developments in lincolnshire “i’m now going to write again to developers saying now that we’ve won these elections you need to be under no illusion this is war” tice said “we will wage war against you people and your terrible ideas” no 10 was incensed at the intervention timed for the eve of the local elections and overshadowing starmer downing street spokespeople batted away blair’s attack even amid the turmoil of poor local election results and a surge to reform the message went out that starmer was sticking to his plans a labour source said “the prime minister’s words at the lancaster house summit have set the tone for the government’s commitment on this agenda – the party is doubling down on clean energy and climate leadership” polls show that voters back action on the climate crisis support for net zero outweighs opposition by two to one 40 of voters think the uk’s 2050 target is a good policy while only 21 view it as a bad idea according to more in common twothirds of voters want the government to either maintain its current pace on the policy or go faster even those labour voters who are willing to back reform claim support for net zero policies luke tryl the executive director of more in common told the guardian “the idea that britain has turned into a nation of net zero sceptics is for the birds reform voters are more sceptical but it’s not something most of them feel strongly about” holly brazier tope the deputy director of politics at green alliance urged starmer to be bold “labour has a bigger majority than it did in 1945 to deliver this change but starmer also understands people aren’t feeling the benefits yet” she said “so the government must focus on reducing people’s bills over this parliament decisively cutting out expensive fossil fuels from the uk’s energy supply” mps nervous after dismal local election results for labour needed the reassurance with many to whom the guardian spoke welcoming starmer’s stated commitment to net zero anna gelderd the mp for south east cornwall said it presented the party with “a golden opportunity” polly billington the mp for east thanet said net zero did not come up in doorstep campaigning and she urged the government to focus more tightly on how green policies could benefit people in their local area rather than just in an abstract or global sense “post local elections we need to maintain our commitment and tell our story in a way that appeals to people who stayed at home or switched away from us on the right and left” she said view image in fullscreen the little cheyne court windfarm on the romney marsh in kent photograph gareth fullerpa the next few months will be crucial in showing whether starmer will follow through on his strong words as a series of looming decisions set the agenda for net zero for the rest of this parliament one will be the publication of the new industrial strategy many sectors of industry are facing tough prospects the steel industry is being propped up with government help automotive manufacturers are worried about tariffs the renewable energy industry has been rocked by the danish company ørsted pulling out of the hornsea windfarm off yorkshire – ironically over high energy costs driven by dependency on expensive gas ministers are squabbling over the flagship housing policy of building 15m new homes a longawaited “future homes standard” is due soon which will determine whether those homes are built to the highest possible green standards this would be good for residents as it would keep their bills low as well as cutting carbon emissions but the costs would have to be paid by developers who have tried to threaten the government by warning they may not meet the building targets for existing houses a warm homes plan is due later this year with £132bn earmarked for a nationwide insulation programme focused on lowerincome households with high energy bills in leaky housing green experts view it as crucial to showing that net zero plans can benefit ordinary working people more detailed plans for boosting onshore wind and solar power generation are also due as well as controversial decisions on expanding gatwick and heathrow airports and another milestone will come at the end of october when the government must produce a coherent strategy on net zero after a landmark victory in the courts last year for friends of the earth one of the biggest tests for labour’s resolve according to tessa khan the executive director of the campaigning group uplift will come this summer when the government must set out its response to a court ruling challenging some potential new oilfields including the rosebank and jackdaw projects khan said “the geological reality is that after 50 years of drilling we have burned most of the gas in the north sea the only ones set to gain from more production are the oil and gas giants who will export what they can and pay off their shareholders with no thought for their workers’ futures as the basin declines to win this fight labour needs to be bolder not retreat” she said a just transition for workers would resonate with voters “labour needs to support the oil and gas workforce to transition to renewables and guarantee that communities that have suffered years of decline as the north sea ages get wealthier from its clean power mission it needs to side with the majority of people who recognise how much fossil fuels are costing us and stand up to the profiteers and their puppets on the right” but shifting the economy to a lowcarbon footing will require investment economists can demonstrate that it will pay off several times over and global investors are keen to participate but in the short term government cash is likely to be needed and that is where the problem lies rachel reeves the chancellor is holed up in 11 downing street preparing a comprehensive spending review to be published next month that will determine how much money goes to each of the government’s priorities over the course of this parliament environment spending is already facing cuts with flood defences sustainable farming subsidies and the warm homes plan in the line of fire with the defence budget soaking up even more resources will anything be left for net zero polanski has an answer he would fund the green transition through a wealth tax an idea that is overwhelmingly popular in polls and is gathering adherents in the labour party too behind closed doors reeves has set herself firmly against any such violations of her selfimposed fiscal rules a wealth tax has been ruled out and she has even relented on her threatened crackdown on taxavoiding nondoms chiselling away at cash promised to insulate the homes of people on low incomes while refusing to tax the rich in the way that a large proportion of the public want is a bold strategy in its own way but hardly aligned with the vision starmer set out last month if the prime minister is really preparing to go into battle for net zero as he promised his real difficulties may lie not with reform’s surge his own backbenchers or even the green party’s ecopopulists he needs to look next door,,,,,,,,Fresh

A0817,2025-05-11,1,Trump wants tariffs on ‘foreign’ movies. But there’s a reason no one wants to shoot in LA,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/11/trump-foreign-movie-tariffs-los-angeles,two more topnotch ideas from the twisted mind of donald trump reopening alcatraz prison currently a very wet very old tourist attraction and applying a 100 tariff on motion pictures made in “foreign lands” somehow i think these two things are related some have speculated that the president hatched his scheme to revitalize the island jail in the middle of san francisco bay after watching the clint eastwood film escape from alcatraz on pbs that feels plausible though it’s a bit odd that his epiphany about alcatraz would come from watching a movie about a daring escape with a convicted criminal for a hero was the rock not on that night if escape from alcatraz had been produced in 2025 the crew probably would not have filmed in the real prison at all or in san francisco or in california or in the united states of america chances are the movie would have been shot in bulgaria or new zealand because of generous tax credits and incentives that have lured countless productions away from the traditional center of cinematic gravity los angeles no one is more eager to leave los angeles than the movie business except for maybe oj simpson in 1994 the nonprofit group filmla found that filming in los angeles is down 30 in the last year and 50 compared with the previous fiveyear average shooting in “foreign lands” as trump referred to every other country in the world is cheaper and more efficient countries such as australia make every possible concession to shoot american blockbusters in their backyard australia offers a 30 tax rebate to bigbudget productions on top of any state or municipal incentives which is nearly irresistible to an american movie studio looking to control costs but a trump tariff on films shot outside the united states would wipe that competitive advantage away completely trump’s truth social post on the subject didn’t specify how one would levy this tariff but regardless of how it’s actually implemented the idea goes that a 200m movie filmed in australia would actually cost 400m after it screened in the us again don’t ask me how that works like with all of trump’s tariff policy he expects this financial cudgel to compel businesses to relocate their operations to america the best way to avoid the tariff is to shift work back here hitting the movie studios over the head with a large hammer is certainly one way to go about change but the other nations siphoning film production away from the united states aren’t bullying the studios they’re fawning over them helping them save money and tempting filmmakers with the chance to shoot somewhere exotic you want to know what isn’t that fun driving to burbank to shoot a movie as a proud angeleno i won’t say anything unnecessarily mean about burbank but i will say i would probably rather spend three months on a beach in australia filming in los angeles can feel like a clockpunching 9to5 job where a large percentage of your day is spent on the freeway craft services meals are often a tepid piece of chicken and a lightly dressed salad in new zealand or bulgaria meddling studio executives pop in every so often to check in but are mostly thousands of miles away in la those meddling studio executives are bumping into you at whole foods i love los angeles but at times it can feel like alcatraz – an isolating movie prison where the only way to escape is to be kicked out la is far more varied and culturally vibrant than its reputation as the “dream factory” but when you work in the movies it can feel a lot smaller and more provincial why not go to belgrade for a few weeks you can skip your son’s private school recital someone else can worry about fixing your pool by memorial day you can go the entire time without eating sweetgreen once trump can fling his tariffs at other movieproducing nations as much as he wants but he simply cannot compete with the paid vacation that is shooting overseas if meryl streep wants to drink ouzo in greece she’s going to shoot mamma mia in greece you can fake any backdrop or locale on a soundstage these days but what you can’t fake is how happy an actor is when they get to enjoy going to work every day you’re not going to get that glow from shooting on the paramount lot i don’t care how much product you put in meryl’s hair it’s not shining like this in van nuys if we want to revitalize the movie business in los angeles then maybe we should start by improving the quality of life in los angeles ensuring our neighbors all have housing expanding and improving public transportation lowering the cost of living so everyone isn’t so annoyed at every second closing at least half of the sweetgreens the city of los angeles has been at the mercy of the film industry for over a century municipal planners and business leaders reverseengineered la to be a company town often at the expense of its citizens as that very industry packs up and shuffles off perhaps it’s time we reflect on what we gave up to shore up this shotgun wedding and claw just a bit of it back,,,,,,,,Fresh
A0818,2025-05-11,1,"Yes, AI will eventually replace some workers. But that day is still a long way off",The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/11/artificial-intelligence-small-business,like a lot of business people i am interested in artificial intelligence so i recently asked chatgpt to give me quotes from tech leaders “telling businesses about the importance of ai for their companies” this came back from apple’s tim cook “ai is already making businesses more efficient more responsive and more personalized it’s a growth driver” one problem cook didn’t actually say that when i asked chatgpt where it got that specific quote the chatbot retreated and said “i apologize for any confusion earlier the quote attributed to tim cook does not appear to have a direct source from a verified interview speech or official apple communication” so i can’t say i was shocked when i read that a recent survey of more than 1000 business leaders by software platform orgvue found that more than half of those that laid off employees because they thought ai would replace their jobs are now regretting the decision anyone firing employees because they thought that ai would do their jobs in 2025 should be fired it really doesn’t take much research to see ai isn’t at the place where it’s replacing people – yet and business managers – particularly in small and midsized companies – who think it is better think again at best generative ai platforms are providing a more enhanced version of search so that instead of sifting through dozens of websites lists and articles to figure out how to choose a great hotel in costa rica fix a broken microwave oven or translate a phrase from mandarin to english we simply ask our chatbot a question and it provides the best answer it finds these platforms are getting better and more accurate and are indeed useful tools for many of us but these chatbots are nowhere near replacing our employees business owners would love to replace their employees with ai but that’s just not reality and won’t be a reality for the foreseeable future “ai chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation” concluded two researchers who looked at the labor market impact of ai chatbots on 11 occupations covering 25000 workers and 7000 workplaces in denmark in 2023 and 2024 “employers are also shifting gears and actively encouraging it but when we look at the economic outcomes it really has not moved the needle” in most of today’s workplaces particularly among the 33m small business owners in the us ai is not being used in any core operation believe me business owners would love to replace their employees and have their accounting customer relationship management inventory order and payroll systems be done by ai in lieu of them but that’s just not reality and won’t be a reality for the foreseeable future why for three reasons first the technology doesn’t exist and what exists doesn’t work very well sure wellknown players like salesforce microsoft and intuit are rolling out ai features designed to do everything from processing accounts payable to sending out email marketing campaigns but these are limited immature and unreliable efforts business

buynowpaylater platform klarna is replacing hundreds of workers with its internally developed customer service system leveraging openai’s large language model and meta is using ai to replace many of its programmers and jp morgan and other wall street firms are building inhouse ai platforms to do the work of its harvard mba graduates but right now ai is just a big corporate play these systems cost tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars most smaller companies have data in multiple places and can’t afford to hire an aiexperienced developer to bring it all together even with the tools available to create their own internal model and then – yikes – build agents on top of this messy outofdate and likely inaccurate information to actually perform tasks not yet there’s no doubt that big things are coming of course the systems rolling out today will – like the generative ai platforms we’re using – become more accurate and reliable businesses will give in to the loss of their privacy for the benefits ai will provide their ai platforms will one day be able to validate when data is potentially incomplete and inaccurate with other sources before launching into tasks yes the

A0819,2025-05-11,1,The insidious doublespeak of Trump’s freedom of ‘choice’,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/may/11/trump-choice-freedom-restrictions,view image in fullscreen illustration ben hickeythe guardian freedom of choice is a venerable american value donald trump’s attachment to it is however highly selective over the first four months of his administration trump has been eagerly promoting the expansion of choice in our economic lives that’s especially the case when it comes to our role as consumers think kitchens baths and automobiles the stated goal every time he talks about commodities has been increasing the number of options so we can select and buy what we like best – environmental effects notwithstanding even his tariffs are only supposed to bring temporary pain as in emptier toy shelves before americanmade abundance starts to rule the day once again in our political lives though it’s a different story the president and his administration have been busy instituting new restrictions on both the possibilities on offer and the picking itself as citizens rather than consumers we’ve been explicitly told our options are permanently contracting to “save our country” no longer for example should it be possible to share “radical antiamerican ideologies” in our classrooms or decide how we want to be addressed as a result our economic and political existences are now on rapidly diverging paths – with questions about what choice is good for where it counts and who is in charge of the menu at the core what we are seeing is the emergence of a new kind of authoritarianism that still pays homage to libertarianism but only in the realm of consumer choice a choice explosion there is a long backstory here ordinary people wherever they found themselves in the world once had many fewer choices to make than we typically do today – and they didn’t attach as much meaning to the act of choosing either one of the things that made one free prior to the modern era was not having to make a lot of decisions about where to live how to make money whom to marry what to own or which political philosophy to back but over the last two and a half centuries the range of both options and opportunities for choicemaking – from determining what to eat for lunch to deciding with whom to spend one’s days and nights – has increased exponentially the categories of people given the formal power to exercise this kind of selfdetermination have expanded too even as the possibility of being able to use this power has remained wildly unevenly distributed this isn’t just an american story either something similar has happened in countries around the globe that consider themselves capitalist democracies from billboards to human rights decrees and constitutions choice has come to stand for freedom itself the roots of this choice explosion extend all the way to the 17th and 18th centuries the expansion of global commerce in the first age of empire is one major source that’s when advertisements and displays of new products in western european cities made use of increasing variety in goods such as colored and patterned fabrics from south asia to develop the idea of consumer choice the reformation is another point of origin insofar as it shattered the unity of european christendom eventually putting religious and then intellectual choice on the table as well shopkeepers auctioneers itinerant preachers and printers helped lead the way alongside philosophers and novelists we might think of all of those figures as early versions of what behavioral economists today call “choice architects” people whose job is to construct the menus of options and often without calling much attention to themselves establish the rules for the game of selection their power even when limited stemmed from creating the conditions for the flourishing of what we have come to experience as the “freedom of choice” but it was the late 19th and 20th centuries that truly sped the process along turning choicemaking into a habitual part of life along with more to choose with every passing year came a mass movement towards imagining ones’ life story as constructed out of free choices made in our free time democracies were a final piece of the puzzle though the era of the american and french revolutions had already established elections as vital to selfrule after about 1870 one nation after another began instituting and standardizing technologies like the secret ballot that brought political determinations into line with a range of other individualized preferencebased activities view image in fullscreen an undated photo of a cafeteria vending machine containing cake and pie desserts photograph h armstrong robertsclassicstock today – at least in theory – we shop for goods entertainments courses of study and vacations we pick our friends lovers and life partners we vote for our favorite candidates we select where we want to live what we want to do for a profession though exceptionally not what we do when we are actually on the job whether to have children and even insurance plans to hedge our bets when facing situations beyond our control whole sciences explain how and why we choose what we do and with what consequences the promise is that with our own choices we can get what we personally prefer and we can be the autonomous people that we yearn to be none of this is to suggest that the proliferation of choice has been an unmitigated boon for humanity as critics have pointed out repeatedly along the way voices on the right of the political spectrum have long bemoaned the way an emphasis on choice upends tradition especially in the moral sphere – making almost every decision into a form of marketplace transaction in which individual taste rules the day many on the left have agreed to an extent suggesting that modeling life on a shop window or bazaar – in which a product human or otherwise exists for every desire – leads to the obfuscation of deep inequalities of opportunity and the neglect of our obligations to each other along with the planet itself they have also complained quite rightly that choice is always a lot less free in the sense of unconstrained than we might think still “choice” has long been a favorite word on both sides of the aisle in us politics and not least when the issue is contentious like the future of healthcare that helps explain why “the right to choose” seemed like a promising slogan in the early 1970s to abortion rights defenders who were eager to find an uncontroversial framing device for their advocacy work in the aftermath of roe v wade who could object to simply having more choices especially when the promise was that one could pick in accord with one’s personal values and desires from billboards to human rights decrees and constitutions choice has come to stand for freedom itself it is even a marker now on global happiness indexes more of one means more of the other ever since the end of the second world war this assumption has made our economic and political lives seem intrinsically linked a shrinking political menu but that isn’t where we are now despite its sporadic and often misleading appeal to the language of choice the trump administration is intent on undoing this historical pact between consumer and political choice and thus of a key element of the liberal paradigm while expanding consumer options or at least giving the impression this is the plan this presidency is working hard to limit options in almost all other spheres something similar is being attempted by many of trump’s counterparts in other increasingly illiberal capitalist democracies from hungary to india around the globe and perhaps this is not just a story about capitalist democracies – even china could now be understood as a nation in thrall to consumer choice at the expense of other forms of freedom but this disjunction is becoming especially pronounced in the us where choice is continuing its ascent in one sphere albeit within the constraints of an everchanging policy on tariffs just as it is being rapidly circumscribed in both practice and lingo in most others apart from the arena of consumption trump is little invested in expanding individual preferencebased selection making when it comes to freedom of choice for consumers which has long been offered up as the flip side of deregulation for industries trump and his minions are all in – at least rhetorically they borrow cliches that are recognizable from 18thcentury sales pitches promising “the greatest choices” in fabrics all the way to milton and rose friedman’s bestselling 1980 book and tv series free to choose the argument is as much about personal liberty as economic benefit right off the bat in his inaugural address this january trump promised americans that he was ending the electric vehicle mandate as well as the rest of joe biden’s environmental initiatives not just to save the auto industry but also so “you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice” consecutive executive orders have extended that same logic to appliances lightbulbs plumbing and even k12 education undoing regulations that save water and energy and reduce global warming will “safeguard the american people’s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances” getting rid of “federal meddling” will also restore “shower freedom” which depends upon americans being “free to choose their showerheads” as for schools in which the right has long supported a voucher system so that families can select the educational approach they prefer in a marketplace that includes religious and forprofit along with public options the executive order states “pres trump will provide every available opportunity for parents to enrich the education of their children through individual choice” “making america great again” thus turns out to be largely a promise about an odd kind of consumer paradise it is not competitive pricing and affordability trump is after nor is it safer or improved goods that would lead to better health and welfare rather just having more options from which to pick is the new holy grail whether we are talking about dishwashers or elementary schools never mind that high tariffs and protectionism will likely make everything more expensive or constrict the field of choice itself at least for a while forcing parents to buy in trump’s words “two dolls instead of 30” in fact under pressure from the business wing of his party he’s already backed away from the most dramatic of these measures in the maga utopia the deregulation of businesses especially when it comes to abandoning rules about environmental concerns or racial equity or even corrupt practices ultimately creates a cornucopia of possibilities for purchasers who are going to be newly empowered to vote with their wallets for whatever products they like best consumer choice is recast as a fundamental right and freedom yet apart from the arena of consumption trump is little invested in expanding individual preferencebased selection making on the contrary in the political sphere the president seems to be looking to move the us in precisely the opposite direction even with falling approval ratings he is still counting on considerable popular support for a vision of the world in which amazon offers up thousands of potential possibilities from movies to toasters for our pleasure but nativist chauvinism and a limited repertoire of christian values

activists protest at the federal courthouse plaza after the overturning of roe v wade by the us supreme court in austin texas on 24 june 2022 photograph suzanne cordeiroafpgetty images when it comes to things that don’t take the form of sellable commodities the parallel framing around freedom as choice has all but disappeared from the vocabulary of this administration it’s also fast disappearing from policy itself as representatives of trump’s brand of republicanism challenge both the traditional understandings of executive power and constitutional protections around civil and political rights the latter are precisely those rights outside the consumer sphere – such as religious rights marriage rights and rights to determine political representatives – that have been redefined as matters of choice ever since the drafting of the universal declaration of human rights in the aftermath of the second world war this isn’t how they are being defined by the us government now the ability to make one’s own determinations in ideas expression and ideology despite some early trump administration bromides about the importance of freedom of speech is on the chopping block as a result of yet another set of executive orders and agency moves that includes bans wherever federal dollars or other forms of federal patronage are at stake on diversity equity and inclusion dei initiatives the investigation of the climate crisis the expression of propalestinian sentiments or the promotion of history art or literature that runs counter to socalled “patriotic” education among other topics such menu limitations are already being felt from classrooms and laboratories to federal agencies and cultural institutions even as court challenges are growing in number restrictions on people’s choice of residency or travel are also more visible by the day not least in the actions of ice let’s not forget either new limits on options in our sexual and familial lives – such as efforts to further reduce abortion rights at the federal level and refusals to allow people to determine their own identities – especially when it comes to gender then there are efforts to curtail voting itself which is the primary form of political choice kamala harris tried during her brief presidential campaign last year to tie support for voting rights to abortion rights as similarly threatened “fundamental freedoms” though the idea never gained much traction this administration sees things differently elections themselves are not likely to disappear entirely any time soon almost every nation state in the world no matter how dictatorial continues to enable some form of voting by citizens that’s because voting is so closely associated today with the idea that in any legitimate state the people’s interests need representation trump moreover likes to claim a popular mandate for his actions even as he sometimes flirts with the idea that he is a “king” who is unbeholden to anyone but himself still the trump administration is already eagerly suggesting that elections won’t be happening in the same way as they once did after long insisting that any trump defeat would be a sure sign of election fraud thus delegitimizing in advance all but one predetermined result indeed as a slate of proposed new rules designed to actually discourage voting in future federal elections makes clear much of his administration’s energy in these first months has gone into trying to find new ways to limit who has access to political or intellectual or even cultural choices to take off the table or reduce rather than increase the set of options available and to narrow the parameters within which choices can be made and registered what other purpose could say new restrictions on the due dates for mailin ballots in federal elections serve even the study of choicemaking one of the great developments of 20thcentury social science including psychology and economics is now being reduced by every means possible from cuts to whole researchfunding programs to the blockage of grants for projects making use of certain prohibited words choice architect in chief what trump is doing is not so much abandoning the idea or practice of choice as making himself our nation’s premier “choice architect” and he’s doing it – at the expense of both the other branches of government and much of the private sector – as part and parcel of the expansion of executive power that is he is using the authority of his position to grant the rest of us sets of approved options from ideas to identities but also continually reminding us that it is he as the nation’s chief executive who determines who gets to choose and how and when and where even threats of high tariffs are meant as leverage – pressure tools in a competitive environment so that the president can tilt the field the way he likes and remake the set of options on behalf of the us consumer artificial intelligence will surely help this is a new 21stcentury form of authoritarianism marked by an enduring quasilibertarian streak when it comes to consumption rather than citizenship of course the freedom of the shopper has never been total freedom it has always been shaped and bounded by multiple forces from the interests of business owners and forprofit taste makers to the “nudges” characteristic of anonymous technocratic policy making such as using incentives to get people to willingly choose to save more for retirement but over the last 75 years much of this choice architecture has become both ubiquitous and invisible with the promise that personal choice meant personal liberty and that freedom in one sphere would be matched by a similar form of freedom in another the age of choice isn’t fully going away any time in the near future it is both too entrenched and too profitable but in a sharp break from much of recent history our political and economic lives seem to be heading in opposite directions investment in

A0821,2025-05-11,1,"Care worker recruitment from abroad to end, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper says",BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c626dyd8y8wo,care worker recruitment from abroad to end cooper says 5 hours ago share save sam francis political reporter share save home secretary vows fundamental shift in immigration system care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas as part of a crackdown on visas for lowerskilled workers the home secretary has told the bbc yvette cooper said it is time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad and rules will change this year instead requiring firms to hire british nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country the government plans to unveil changes to visa and recruitment laws on monday in a bid to cut net migration and says measures will cut up to 50000 lowerskilled and care workers coming to the uk over the next year shadow home secretary chris philp said the plans were too little and called for an annual cap on migration successive governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration which is the number of people coming to the uk minus the number leaving net migration climbed to a record 906000 in june 2023 and last year it stood at 728000 the home office has not yet officially confirmed what will be in its immigration white paper due early next week speaking on the bbcs sunday with laura kuenssberg cooper said the government was setting up plans for a substantial reduction in net migration but added targets would not be set saying they undermined the credibility of anything that governments do the threshold for skilled visas is expected to be increased to graduate level tightened from the current alevel measure there will also be a narrower list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries cooper said but did not give examples currently roles considered to be in short supply in the uk like carpenters graphic designers and pharmaceutical technicians can be placed on the immigration salary list isl allowing employers to hire overseas workers at discount set at 80 of the market rate cooper said the government expects those changes will lead to a reduction of up to 50000 fewer lower skilled visas over the course of the next year as well as visa changes the home secretary added there would be new requirements for training commitments to get people who are not working back into the labour market here in the uk philp who said he agreed with the plan to end care worker recruitment from abroad told the same programme the conservatives would push parliament to vote on a yearly migration cap this week when asked what the cap would be he said were working on the detail to specify that number but it would be a further reduction of significantly more than 50000 he argued that if labour had stuck with tory changes net migration would have dropped by about 400000 cooper also said there would be some changes to rules around international students and graduates we will let them continue to come and to stay and to work afterwards she added we are making some changes particularly around the standards and the compliance for universities because again weve had problems where some universities havent had proper standards in place theyve recruited people to come as international students who then havent completed their courses have either overstayed or other problems with compliance of the system the government has already tightened rules around care sector worker after coming to power last july applications for health and care worker visas peaked at 18300 in august 2023 then collapsed to 1700 by april this year following the ban on bringing dependants and on 9 april an additional restriction was added requiring care firms who want to recruit a new worker from overseas to prove they attempted to recruit a worker from within england first but the new rules will require care companies to recruit from domestic workers or a pool of over 10000 care workers brought to the uk on visas for jobs that never materialised alongside this cooper promised to bring in a new fair pay agreement for care workers to make care jobs more attractive to uk workers and reduce overseas demand nadra ahmed the national care associations executive chairman told the bbc the changes would a challenging scenario for care homes even worse she said providers always prefer to have a domestic workforce but said it was not available responding to the changes the liberal democrats social care spokesperson helen morgan said the government was tinkering around the edges yet failing to properly tackle the crisis in our social care labour must step up and take proper action to address recruitment shortages including paying our care workers properly and rolling out a plan for career progression she said while labour have been reviewing migration policy for months many have suggested this weeks crackdown was triggered by reform uks surge in the local elections where it took the runcorn and helsby constituency off labour and won control of 10 councils reform leader nigel farage claimed this new legislation is only happening because reform is leading in the polls labours plan was doomed to fail he argued as immigration was not just about what numbers come in but who comes in and if they can

A0840,2025-05-11,1,"This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Software Stock -- a 1,090% Gainer Since Its IPO -- Could Soar Another 285%, According to Dan Ives. Is It Time to Buy Like There's No Tomorrow?",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-software-stock-192000706.html,the unreliable nature of these deals brings a level of uncertainty as it relates to future growth and wall street loathes businesses whose growth prospects look unreliable in order to win over investor confidence palantir needed to show that its software platforms could win adoption from commercial customers too thankfully this is where ai comes into the spotlight palantir has relied heavily on deal flow from the dod and adjacent government agencies for much of its 20year history while there are big bucks to be made in defense contracting public sector business tends to be lumpy lets take a look at palantirs operating results and valuation trends to assess the stocks ability to sustain its current momentum yet even with such a parabolic rise over the last couple of years wedbush securities technology analyst dan ives suggests palantir stock could still soar another 285 over the next two or three years bringing the company into the coveted trilliondollar club since its initial public offering ipo in 2020 palantirs shares have gained about 1090 as of this writing notably the entirety of these gains occurred after april 2023 when palantir released its latest software suite the artificial intelligence platform aip for most of its history skeptics on wall street viewed palantir as no more than a glorified consulting business working closely with the department of defense dod while much of palantirs business still revolves around government contracts rising interest in ai has fueled a new wave of potential for the company particularly in the private sector one company that has benefited greatly from ai is palantir technologies nasdaq pltr sure demand for aipowered software services has been a bellwether for palantir over the last couple of years at a deeper level though ai has essentially transformed palantirs entire operation artificial intelligence ai is redefining how businesses across every major sector are operating from enhanced analytics automating mundane tasks in the workforce and even building selfdriving cars it seems like ai is extending its influence across the entire economy analyst dan ives thinks palantir could reach a 1 trillion valuation in two or three years but historical trends suggest otherwise while the company still works closely with the department of defense dod palantirs main growth catalyst is now the private sector story continues in the table below ive outlined palantirs customer breakdown and commercial account growth over the last several years category 2021 2022 2023 2024 q1 2025 commercial accounts 62 71 75 80 81 government accounts 38 29 25 20 19 commercial account growth yoy 200 77 44 52 46 data source investor relations customer type breakdown for the trailing12month period in just four years palantirs customer base has shifted from less than twothirds in the commercial sector to more than 80 while it may look like the companys commercial business growth is slowing dont let the figures above fool you back in 2021 palantir only had 237 customers in total as of the end of the first quarter of 2025 the company boasted 769 customers not only has palantir accelerated its private sector penetration since the launch of aip but the company is also signing more meaningful deals underscored by consistently rising revenue and widening profit margins image source getty images history suggests tougher times may be ahead for the stock palantirs dominance in the software realm over the last couple of years coupled with a bullish overall sentiment around the ai opportunity explains the stocks incredible rise however smart investors understand that a stock cannot climb forever immediately following the companys q1 earnings report on may 5 palantir stock plummeted this wasnt because the earnings results were poor in fact palantir knocked it out of the park even so the average consensus price target among analysts covering palantir is about 94 suggesting about 21 downside as of may 8 investors may simply be waking up to the fact that palantirs valuation has expanded beyond levels that are congruent with the companys actual growth when aip launched in april 2023 palantirs pricetosales ps ratio was about 8 since then its ps valuation has expanded more than elevenfold in just two years palantir is one of the priciest stocks in the software space today and history suggests that shares are due for a pullback back in the late 1990s when internet stocks were experiencing their own moment of euphoria companies such as microsoft amazon and cisco topped out at ps multiples between 30 and 40 this was prior to the dotcom bubble exploding which saw many highgrowth stocks crater in value given that palantirs current ps is between two and three times more than the largest and most influential technology businesses during the peak of the dotcom era investors should prepare for some valuation compression in the near term could palantir reach a 1 trillion valuation valuation multiples generally normalize over the long term another way of looking at this dynamic is that as companies begin to scale and generate more profits investors begin to value these businesses based on earnings and less so on sales today amazon cisco and microsoft arent generally analyzed through the lens of the ps ratio rather most investors look at these businesses on a pricetoearnings pe or pricetofreecashflow pfcf basis so even though these companies are trading for much lower ps ratios than they were many years ago that doesnt mean shareholder value wasnt created over the last 20 years amazon and microsoft in particular have evolved into two of the most valuable companies in the world as measured by market cap even though palantirs valuation multiples will likely compress over the next couple of years that doesnt necessarily mean the company wont ever become a trilliondollar stock that said it probably wont happen in the next two or three years as ives forecasts instead of focusing on the next two or three years investors should think longer term the most prudent strategy regarding an investment in palantir is to buy the stock at different price points take advantage of dips and prepare to hold onto

A0841,2025-05-11,1,How much inventory did companies actually build ahead of tariffs?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-much-inventory-did-companies-actually-build-ahead-of-tariffs-140916931.html,“companies typically maintain about 3 months of inventory” chadha wrote “they have been raising that buffer over the last 10 years especially since the covid pandemic supply chain disruptions and the lowest levels in the last 10 years have been about 2 months which suggests companies could run their buffers down for a month at most in hopes for a tariff reprieve” “in clear evidence of prebuying goods imports surged in q1 especially in march but relative to the prior run rate of 275bn a month we estimate the excess imports over the last 3 months were about 190bn or around 3 weeks extra“ chadha wrote in his may 2 research note deutsche bank’s binky chadha analyzed the data to estimate how much extra inventory companies have accumulated “as a precaution weve taken steps to build inventory in certain markets to mitigate potential tariff impact in the short term“ wd40 “we built some inventory where possible in certain items as we anticipate that to happen so that gives a little relief of amounts needed to in some of the items but the impact should be mostly concentrated in the second half” kraft heinz “weve done some forward buys of inventory where were the firstparty seller our thirdparty sellers have pulled forward a number of items so they have inventory here as well” amazon “for transparency you will see that we did build ahead inventory and thats reflected in our manufacturing purchase obligations that youll see on the quarterly filing when it comes out“ apple “looking outside the us demand for us inbound services surged as customers pull forward inventory purchases ahead of expected tariff changes” ups “our clients are getting ready were seeing some accelerating of imports to stockpile inventories” citigroup various anecdotes from companies and a spike in imports at the beginning of this year suggest this pullforward could be significant here are some notable quotes from q1 earnings season one of the actions some companies have taken to mitigate the impact of future tariffs has been to pulling forward expected future purchases and stockpiling goods before costs go up a big economic question right now to what degree does today’s economic activity reflect a pull forward of purchases that would’ve occurred further down the road story continues in other words companies were already carrying extra inventory before president trump unveiled his aggressive view on tariffs “excess imports combined with inventory rundowns gives companies about 1 to 2 months before the tariff impacts start to bite” chadha said companies are preparing for tariff uncertainty by buying inventory twotothree months out · bloomberg so while chadha’s estimate of “about 1 to 2 months“ of buffer for sp 500 companies is arguably significant it doesn’t even buy a quarter’s worth of time some analysts think it’s less ⌛️ in a separate analysis of retailer inventories bofa analysts expressed skepticism toward the idea that warehouses are well stocked from their note emphasis added “there was a surge in imports of consumer goods into the us in march according to census bureau data does this mean retailers inventories are set to swell in our view no the ratio of retailers inventories to their monthly sales was not especially high in recent data to begin with and at the same time consumers also appear to have been buying ahead with bank of america internal data showing strength in consumer durables spending in march and april moreover bank of america internal data on retailers payments to transportation and shipping companies does not suggest a big ramp up in inventories and it appears container shipments into los angeles are likely down in may so we think it is possible retail inventories may actually look lean in coming months” it’s worth noting that the most recent retail inventories data from the census only goes through february so those particular figures are a bit stale retain inventories loooked lean heading into tariff uncertainty · bofa that said bofa makes a good point about consumers “buying ahead” this suggests that a lot of goods left warehouses as quickly as they came in this is consistent with government data on consumer spending which has been very strong goldman sachs’ david kostin analyzed the sp 500 and came to a similar conclusion “1q data do not show a buildup of inventories” kostin wrote on friday “the sp 500 inventory to sales ratio declined yearyear with the largest declines in the autos and consumer durables apparel industries however many retailers have yet to report 1q results” the sp 500 inventorytosales ratio declined with the largest declines in autos consumer durables and apparel · goldman sachs the march retail sales report showed an unusual spike in autos sales which supports the idea that consumers pulled forward purchases to frontrun tariffs to kostin’s point about fresh data retailers will be announcing their q1 results in the coming weeks on thursday morning we get walmart’s earnings that day also comes with the april retail sales and march inventories reports everyone will be watching for clues about inventory builds as well as how much inventory was cleared out by sales pulled forward zooming out 🔭 even if we had a more clear understanding of inventory levels the bigger issue continues to be the uncertainty around tariffs if we ultimately get very high tariffs then inventory stockpiling would’ve been a good move if any new tariffs are low then inventory stockpiling could prove to be a costly error there’s also the possibility that proposed tariffs or any tariff deals continue to get delayed and this uncertainty nightmare persists the big picture 🖼️ these are uncertain times the economic data is sending ambiguous signals managers are having an unusually hard time forecasting the near future for the businesses and investors and analysts are having an unusually hard time modeling where stock prices are headed in the coming months and quarters it’s periods like this where longterm investors have an edge time “nobody knows what the market is going to do tomorrow next week next month” warren buffett said last week but as he often does he argued “the longterm trend is up“ there’s basically three scenarios investors always have to consider 1 things improve from here and the market goes up 2 things get worse before they get better which means markets could fall before resuming a more firm rally or 3 things get worse and never get better if we’re facing scenario 3 then we may have bigger problems than stocks not recovering but scenario 3 has never played out scenarios 1 and 2 favor longterm

get some more clarity here’s where things stand earnings look bullish the longterm outlook for the stock market remains favorable bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth and earnings are the most important driver of stock prices demand is positive demand for goods and services remains positive supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets job creation while cooling also remains positive and the federal reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — has shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market but growth is cooling while the economy remains healthy growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle the economy is less “coiled” these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded it has become harder to argue that growth is destiny actions speak louder than words we are in an odd period given that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentimentoriented data consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow and trend at record levels from an investor’s perspective what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up stocks are not the economy analysts expect the us stock market could outperform the us economy thanks largely due to positive operating leverage since the pandemic companies have adjusted their cost structures aggressively this has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment including hardware powered by ai these moves are resulting in positive operating leverage which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth mind the everpresent risks of course this does not mean we should get complacent there will always be risks to worry about — such as us political uncertainty geopolitical turmoil energy price volatility cyber attacks etc there are also the dreaded unknowns any of these risks can flare up and spark shortterm volatility in the markets investing is never a smooth ride there’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all longterm investors should expect to experience as they build wealth in the markets always keep your stock market seat belts fastened think long term for now there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and

Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/mortgages/article/mortgage-refinance-rates-today-sunday-may-11-2025-100035238.html,mortgage interest rates are up today according to zillow data the 30year fixed mortgage rate has risen by one basis point to 672 and the 15year fixed rate has increased by seven basis points to 603 mortgage rates typically go up when the us economy thrives and down when the economy struggles a lot of economic data will be released this upcoming week especially surrounding inflation this data could move home loan rates one way or the other — however it probably wont cause any dramatic shifts dig deeper how inflation impacts mortgage rates have questions about buying owning or selling a house submit your question to yahoos panel of realtors using this google

mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house although thats not always the case read more is now a good time to refinance your mortgage refinance interest rates monthly mortgage payment calculator use the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments our free mortgage calculator also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment this gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest 30year vs 15year fixed mortgage rates the average 30year mortgage rate today is 672 a 30year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months your monthly payment is lower than with a shorterterm loan the average 15year mortgage rate is 603 today when deciding between a 15year and a 30year mortgage consider your shortterm versus longterm goals a 15year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30year term this is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate but the tradeoff is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time let’s say you get a 300000 mortgage with a 30year term and a 672 rate your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about 1940 and you’d pay 398334 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original 300000 if you get that same 300000 mortgage with a 15year term and a 603 rate your monthly payment would jump to 2536 but you’d only pay 156558 in interest over the years fixedrate vs adjustablerate mortgages with a fixedrate mortgage your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan you will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage though an adjustablerate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time then the rate will go up or down depending on several factors such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract for example with a 71 arm your rate would be locked in for the first seven years then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term adjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates but once the initial ratelock period ends it’s possible your rate will go up lately though some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other dig deeper fixedrate vs adjustablerate mortgages how to get a low mortgage rate mortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments great or excellent credit scores and low debttoincome ratios so if you want a lower rate try saving more improving your credit score or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes waiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now if you’re ready to buy focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate how to choose a mortgage lender to find the best mortgage lender for your situation apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score when choosing a lender don’t just compare interest rates look at the mortgage annual percentage rate apr — this factors in the interest rate any discount points and fees the apr which is also expressed as a percentage reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money this is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders learn more best mortgage lenders for firsttime home buyers current mortgage rates faqs what is a mortgage interest rate at right now according to zillow the national average 30year mortgage rate is 672 and the average 15year mortgage rate is 603 but these are national averages so the average in your area could be different averages are typically higher in

Jefferies and BTIG Suggest 2 Dividend Stocks to Buy,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seeking-10-dividend-yield-jefferies-174858589.html,jefferies analyst matthew hurwit covers this bdc and he is impressed by the company’s potential to deliver returns the regular dividend was declared at 37 cents per share and was accompanied by a supplemental payment of 1 cent per share the regular dividend annualizes to 148 per share and gives a forward yield of 107 financially the company reported adjusted net investment income of 039 per share in q1 2025 that came in below expectations missing forecasts by 4 cents looking at the drilldowns we find that the company’s portfolio is made up mainly of firstlien senior secured loans at 76 of the total common equity makes up 12 and secondlien senior secured loans make up 5 of the total portfolio 965 of the assets are floating rate and the remainder are fixed obdc invests in a wide range of business sectors and more than half of its investments are in the southern and western regions of the us obdc is managed by blue owl credit advisors an arm of blue owl capital inc and it specializes in financing middlemarket companies the firm takes a debtfirst approach with a selective eye toward equity building a portfolio that now spans 236 businesses with a combined fair value of 177 billion the average investment size is 75 million we’re starting with a bdc – short for business development company these companies step in where traditional banks often won’t offering capital and credit to growing businesses that power the us economy blue owl capital corporation obdc is a key player here providing financing and credit services to the kinds of firms that have long served as the country’s economic engine that’s why we turned to the tipranks database to see whether the rest of wall street is backing these picks here’s what we found however diving into highyield stocks calls for extra diligence while they can offer attractive income they may also come with increased risks such as potential dividend cuts or underlying business challenges investment firms jefferies and btig have recently pointed to two such names that stand out both offer dividend yields approaching 10 – about seven times higher than the sp 500 average highyield dividend stocks can be a powerful way to generate steady income – and a few are offering payouts that crush the market average story continues “we view obdc as a compelling income investment with a basecase total return driven by a doubledigit dividend yield and modest navshare growth in an upside scenario continued strong credit performance and increased investor recognition could result in multiple expansion pricenav moving to a premium delivering additional capital gains in a downside scenario a material economic downturn could pressure portfolio companies and valuations however obdc’s conservative portfolio 83 senior secured loans and low nonaccruals should help mitigate losses overall obdc’s large scale prudent underwriting and support from blue owl’s platform underpin a favorable riskadjusted return profile for incomefocused investors” hurwit opined hurwit goes on to put a buy rating on obdc shares and his 16 price target implies a oneyear upside potential of 15 add in the regular dividend yield and this stock’s total oneyear return may reach as high as 257 overall obdc has a strong buy consensus rating from the street’s analysts based on 8 recent reviews that include 6 buys and 2 holds the shares are priced at 1389 and their 1572 average price

its portfolio stance to meet changing conditions “while we have been positive on ari’s platform for some time we feared that largescale challenged loans namely steinway tower and a portfolio of hospitals in ma could require the company to retain additional capital limiting its ability to consistently originate and grow its loan book that said ari swiftly resolved its ma hospital loan exposure and given recent sales activity at steinway we expect the company to start collecting income on its 288m senior mezz loan on the property in 2q25 given a healthier position in steinway steady loan origination pipeline institutional backing from apollo global management and platform in the ukeurope 52 of the loan book we believe ari is positioned to outperform its peer group during a time of volatility for the us commercial real estate market” catherwood explained catherwood’s comments support his buy rating on ari shares while his 11 price target suggests that ari will gain 1470 going

A0864,2025-05-11,1,"NHS nurses could go on strike over 25% erosion in pay, union boss warns",The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/11/nhs-nurses-could-go-on-strike-pay-rise-rcn,nurses deserve a major pay rise to counter the 25 real terms erosion over the last 15 years and may go on strike again unless ministers dramatically improve their “completely unacceptable” 28 offer to nhs staff the profession’s leader has said prof nicola ranger the general secretary of the royal college of nursing said nurses wanted full restoration of lost earnings and could “bare our teeth” in pursuit of that goal her remarks in an interview with the guardian heighten the risk of a new wave of strikes in the months ahead by key staff unhappy with what they are being offered disrupting nhs care the rcn’s annual congress opens on monday in liverpool resident doctors in england – formerly known as junior doctors – have already launched a ballot for a potential fresh round of strikes after the 11 rounds they held in 2023 and 2024 when they were seeking a 35 rise their action won them a 22 salary uplift over the two years 202324 and 2425 the british medical association has warned wes streeting the health secretary that they will stage further walkouts for up to six months unless they get a 10 increase for 202526 which he says is unaffordable they want the value of their pay restored to 2008 levels by 2027 and have said their “successful action over previous years” shows that strikes lead to better pay deals ranger cited the junior doctors’ strikes and outlined a similar demand to them – restoration of the value of nurses’ incomes which have fallen in real terms since 2010 due to inflation and low pay rises – in explaining why the 518000 nurses working in the nhs across the uk deserve a 25 salary boost “nursing pay since 2010 in real terms has reduced by 25 the junior doctors were very clear about pay restoration we still believe in that as well it’s where we start it’s our starting point” she said for this year’s negotiations over what percentage rise nurses should get this year “we want to start bringing nursing pay back to where it needs to be the junior doctors they went on strike 11 times they were very successful in what they did “if every nurse in every setting was to put down their tools even for one hour in every setting the impact would be catastrophic so if we’re essential to patients in every setting start to value us start to recognise our worth and start to pay us accordingly nursing is undervalued misunderstood and underpaid” asked what the rcn would do if the government does not award what it regards as a fair amount ranger replied “we will come to a point where we will start to have to bare our teeth and start looking at what we do” but she added “they don’t want strike action nor do we” ranger did not specify what size of rise this year would be acceptable and stressed that the union understood that restoration of the 25 lost income would have to happen over several years nhs leaders said ranger’s warning shot was unhelpful to solving the issue of nhs pay especially given the financial problems of the service in england danny mortimer the chief executive of nhs employers who leads the nhs’s side of pay negotiations said “it is imperative that the government takes a considered view on what to do next it is also imperative that all trade unions including the rcn seek out dialogue rather than confrontation as a way to resolve their longterm aspirations for their members “nhs leaders want nurses and all their staff to receive sustainable longterm investment in their pay reflecting the crucial roles they deliver for society and the nation such awards need though to be affordable” he highlighted the round of budget cuts that england’s 215 nhs trusts are having to make to comply with a brutal “reset” ordered by sir jim mackey nhs england’s new chief executive nurses in england went on strike on eight days between december 2022 and may 2023 they later received a oneoff payment of £1655£3789 for 202223 and a 5 pay rise for 202324 given the big fall in numbers applying to be nurses and high numbers quitting early ranger said the government’s plans to improve the nhs would fail unless streeting gives nurses a significant pay uplift to help tackle the twin problems of recruitment and retention ministers in scotland have offered nhs nurses midwives and other staff there an 8 rise over the next two years – 425 this year and 375 in 202627 the nhs pay review body prb covering the 138 million nhs staff on agenda for change terms and conditions ukwide has advised ministers to give them close to 3 slightly higher than the 28 the government has proposed doctors’ and dentists’ pay is decided by a separate pay advisory body ministers are considering how to respond to the prb’s recommendation in a further sign of tension over nhs pay the union unison which represents tens of thousands of staff is consulting members in england and wales over their readiness to strike if the 202526 pay award “fails to keep up with rising living costs” a government spokesperson said “this government inherited a broken nhs with an overworked undervalued and demoralised workforce we hugely value the work of talented nurses and midwives and through our plan for change we are rebuilding the nhs for the benefit of patients and staff and ensuring nursing remains an attractive career choice “one of the first acts of this government was to award nurses an aboveinflation pay rise for the first time in years because we recognise that their pay has been hit over previous years we are carefully considering the recommendations from the nhs pay review body and will update as soon as possible”,,,,,,,,Fresh

is a cousin 10 hours ago share save giulia granchi and vitor tavares bbc brasil reporters sent to serrinha dos pintos share save mariana castiñeirascaroline souza affected families in serrinha dos pintos lived without a diagnosis until geneticist silvana santos arrived before silvana santos arrived in the little town of serrinha dos pintos more than 20 years ago residents had no idea why so many local children had lost the ability to walk the remote town in northeastern brazil is home to fewer than 5000 people and is where biologist and geneticist santos identified and named a previously unknown condition spoan syndrome caused by a genetic mutation the syndrome affects the nervous system gradually weakening the body it only appears when the altered gene is inherited from both parents santoss research marked the first time the disease had been described anywhere in the world for this and later work she was named one of the bbcs 100 most influential women in 2024 before santos arrived families had no explanation for the illness affecting their children today residents talk confidently about spoan and genetics she gave us a diagnosis we never had after the research help came people funding wheelchairs says marquinhos one of the patients serrinha dos pintos a world of its own where santos is from in são paulo brazils largest and wealthiest city many of her neighbours were members of the same extended family originally from serrinha many of them were cousins of varying degrees married to each other they told santos that many of people in their hometown couldnt walk but that noone knew why one of the neighbours daughters zirlândia suffered from a debilitating condition as a child her eyes moved involuntarily and over time she lost strength in her limbs and needed to use a wheelchair requiring help with even the simplest tasks years of investigation would lead santos and a research team to identify these as symptoms of spoan syndrome they would go on to find 82 other cases worldwide mariana castiñeirasbbc the entrance of serrinha dos pintos where research suggests nearly a third of couples are related at the invitation of her neighbours santos visited serrinha on holiday she describes her arrival as stepping into a world of its own not just because of the lush scenery and mountain views but also due to what seemed to be a notable social coincidence the more she walked and spoke with locals the more surprised she was at how common marriages between cousins were serrinhas geographical isolation and little inward migration mean that many of the population are related making marriage between cousins far more likely and more socially acceptable worldwide marriages between relatives were estimated at around 10 in the early 2010s more recent data shows the rate varies widely from over 50 in countries like pakistan to 14 in brazil and less than 1 in the us and russia most children born to pairs of cousins are healthy experts say but these marriages do face a higher risk of a harmful genetic mutation being passed down through the family if a couple is unrelated the chance of having a child with a rare genetic disorder or disability is about 2–3 for cousins the risk rises to 5–6 per pregnancy explains geneticist luzivan costa reis from brazils federal university of rio grande do sul a 2010 study led by santos showed that more than 30 of couples in serrinha were related and a third of them had at least one child with a disability long road to diagnosis santos set out to find a diagnosis for the people of serrinha and she began planning a detailed genetic study requiring multiple trips and eventually leading to her relocating to the region she drove the 1250 miles 2000km to and from são paulo many times in the early years of her research she collected dna samples doortodoor chatting to locals over coffee and gathering family stories all the while trying to locate the mutation causing the disease what was supposed to be three months of fieldwork turned into years of dedication it all led to the publication in 2005 of the teams study revealing the existence of spoan in the brazilian hinterland santoss team found that the mutation involves the loss of a small fragment of a chromosome which causes a gene to overproduce a key protein in brain cells they said it came from maximiano a womaniser in our family recalls farmer lolô whose daughter rejane has spoan lolô now 83 married his cousin and never left serrinha he still tends cattle and relies on family to care for rejane who struggles with daily tasks but the genetic mutation behind spoan is far older than the legend of old maximiano it likely arrived more than 500 years ago with early european settlers in the northeast of brazil sequencing studies show strong european ancestry in patients supporting records of portuguese dutch and sephardic jewish presence in the region says santos the theory gained strength after two spoan cases were found in egypt and further studies showed that the egyptian cases also shared european ancestry pointing to a common origin in the iberian peninsula it likely came with related sephardic jews or moors fleeing the inquisition says santos she believes more cases may exist globally especially in portugal mariana castiñeirasbbc silvana santos no longer lives in the area but she continues to visit understanding the risks although theres been little progress toward a cure tracking patients has brought some change rejane recalls how people used to be called cripples now theyre simply said to have spoan wheelchairs brought not just independence but also helped prevent deformities in the past many with the condition had been left simply lying in bed or on the floor as spoan progresses physical limitations worsen with age and by 50 nearly all patients become fully dependent on carers this is the case for inéss children who are among the oldest in serrinha chiquinho 59 can no longer speak and marquinhos 46 has limited communication abilities its hard to have a special child we love them the same but we suffer for them says inés who is married to a second cousin mariana castiñeirasbbc inês has two sons

of dating in serrinha dos pintos deep down were all cousins were related to everyone she says couples like larissa and saulo are the focus of a new research project which santos is also involved in

A0867,2025-05-11,1,BBC's tense encounter with sanctioned Israeli settler while filming in West Bank,BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d1j3v2y3mo,bbc teams tense encounter with sanctioned israeli settler while filming in west bank 12 hours ago share save fergal keane alice doyard bbc news reporting from jordan valley share save moment bbc has tense encounter with sanctioned israeli settler dust was rising on the track it hung in the hot midday air as the white jeep came towards us the driver was less than a minute away i think its moshe sharvit said gil alexander 72 a devout religious jew who tries to protect palestinian shepherds from intimidation by jewish settlers over the last year weve been documenting his work with shepherds in the northern jordan valley in the israelioccupied west bank the man approaching us was placed under sanctions by britain and the eu last year after they said he had used physical aggression threatened families at gunpoint and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace palestinian communities in a case reported by our colleagues at bbc eye investigates last year a palestinian grandmother alleged that moshe sharvit had forced her to leave her family home in october 2023 ayesha shtayyeh also said he pointed a gun at her head and threatened to kill her weve been here for 50 years…what have i ever done to him she asked when bbc eye interviewed her she said her familys troubles began after moshe sharvit established a socalled outpost a settlement that is illegal under both israeli and international law chasing away the familys sheep damaging property and constantly threatening them the alleged incident with the gun was the final straw moshe sharvit did not respond to bbc eyes requests for a response to ayeshas account back on the mountainside the man accused of this violence stopped his car and approached us nodding towards gil alexander he asked us do you know hes a very dangerous guy when our translator explained to moshe sharvit we were from the bbc he said ah the bbc… great lovers of israel… he went on to call us bad and dangerous people addressing our translator he said so do you understand that theyre the people who are most dangerous to the state of israel then he phoned the police asking them to come to the scene when he wasnt calling the police he filmed us filming him moshe sharvit and gil alexander represent starkly different visions of israels future moshe sharvit believes all of the west bank which settlers and the israeli government call judea and samaria were given by god to the jews in this he is supported by senior ministers in the government including the minister of finance bezalel smotrich and the minister of public security itamar bengvir both men are settlers and leaders of farright ultranationalist parties ayesha shtayyeh alleges moshe sharvit threatened her with a gun and told her to leave her home of 50 years smotrich has said gaza will be totally destroyed and that its people will be totally despairing understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in gaza and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places the other places he envisages are foreign countries bengvir who is responsible for the police has convictions for inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organisation israels prime minister benjamin netanyahu relies on the support of the farright settler movement to keep his government in power he criticised the sanctions imposed on moshe sharvit and other settlers saying his government viewed the move with great severity us sanctions against moshe sharvit were dropped when president donald trump came to power the uns top court ruled last year that israels occupation of the palestinian territories is against international law and that all settlement activity is illegal israel rejects this and argues that settlements are necessary for security citing lethal attacks by palestinian gunmen on settlers such as the killing of three people last january in the west bank gil alexander left and moshe sharvit both phoned the police settlement expansion is anathema to gil alexander he considers himself a zionist but within the existing borders of israel these are the frontiers that existed before it seized the west bank in the 1967 middle east war he is part of a network called the jordan valley activists – moshe sharvit calls them anarchists offering solidarity and working for peaceful coexistence with the palestinians what they the settlers want to see happen gil alexander told us is that it will be an area completely free of arabs it isnt moshe its all the people above him who sent him here meaning from the top moshe sharvits desire to have the jordan valley empty of palestinians is shared by the leader of the regional council a governmentsupported body david elhayani who has visited the sanctioned settler in his air conditioned office about 15km 9 miles from moshe sharvits settler outpost he told us the notion of settler violence is an invention of the anarchist extreme left meant to harm the settlement image as for the future of the palestinians he was emphatic they should go to neighbouring jordan this country needs to be free of arabs its the only way its a global interest why global because the minute there wont be arabs here it will be a jewish nation for the jews who wont have to hurt each other there wont be conflict there wont be anything gil alexander who describes himself as a zionist believes israeli territory should end at the 1967 borders gil alexander and moshe sharvit have a history of antagonism during an altercation on a palestinian farmers land in january 2023 moshe sharvit says gil alexander tried to seize his firearm from its holster while speaking to our translator he produced a video of the incident on his phone you can see gil alexander same hat and glasses thats me here you see he grabs my gun gil alexander says he was acting in selfdefence after moshe sharvit had grabbed his walking stick and the phone of his friend and violently pushing it he says he feared moshe sharvit was going to use the weapon as a result moshe sharvit got a restraining order which forbids gil alexander from being within 25km 15 miles of his farm the police have charged gil alexander with illegal possession of a weapon the one he allegedly tried to take from moshe sharvit and assault the issue will be considered by the israeli courts moshe sharvit himself is the subject of a restraining order forbidding him to approach a palestinian family living near his outpost for six months since march this year during our encounter the settler claimed that gil alexander had breached his restraining order by taking us to the high ground overlooking the valley the peace activist told us later that he had mistakenly strayed just over half a kilometre inside the area of the order although moshe sharvits settlement is illegal even under israeli law it has not been removed human rights organisations and numerous eyewitnesses testify that the israeli army and police frequently stand by while settlers attack palestinian villages the violence has escalated sharply since the 7 october 2023 hamas attack on israel in which about 1200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped and which triggered the gaza war moshe sharvit approached blocked the road and phoned the police according to a report issued by the un office for humanitarian affairs there were 1804 attacks by settlers against palestinians in the period january 2024 to march 2025 the israeli human rights group yesh din there is law reported that only 3 of complaints made against settlers resulted in a conviction in six days last month from 22 to 28 april the un recorded 14 incidents involving settlers that left 36 palestinians injured in the tense atmosphere on the mountainside and wanting to avoid any escalation we decided to leave as we walked away moshe sharvit went to his jeep and drove ahead of us stopping where the track turned down the mountain our way out was blocked there was noone we could appeal to apart from the man preventing us from leaving again he phoned the police asking them to come gil alexander phoned the police and his lawyer our team was worried that more settlers would come then something surprising happened i suggested to moshe sharvit that he should agree to be interviewed after a brief pause he said bring the camera what followed was less an interview than a series of declarations he was doing the work of god he said why did local bedouin shepherds say they were very afraid of him i asked no that is a lie theyre telling stories so the world will think were crazy its not true its all lies that are built on lies of dozens of years of lying… he said the arabs since the formation of the country and before all the past 77 years theyve been preoccupied with harming the people of israel harming the land of israel and causing the nation of israel to be miserable and pitiful but they dont understand that the harder they try the lion will wake from his sleep and within one day well end this story he repeated the analogy of the lion later in the interview saying in what sounded like ominous words that the palestinians were pushing the lion so hard into the corner that there will be no choice left but to finish this story 7 october was small one day itll be big as for peaceful coexistence such as gil alexander supports he said there was no such thing as peace with enemies who try to destroy you moshe sharvits brother harel was killed fighting in gaza in december 2023 his world is the pastureland the stony hills of the jordan valley his sheep and cattle the bed and breakfast he has opened he produced a glossy video replete with a backing track of american country music to promote his venture he spoke with contempt for the british sanctions against him they were a new kind of antisemitism he claimed the minute someone tries to hurt me i get stronger my spirit…i receive energies my spirit continues on its mission i continue advancing forward and planting roots deep into the land of israel im not bothered by britain or america or anyone moshe sharvit agreed to be interviewed then he drove away we were free to move on later as we were having lunch in a café about 15km nine miles away a policeman appeared looking for gil alexander he went with the police officer for questioning after about an hour he returned telling us he had been ordered not to enter the jordan valley for two weeks he plans to lodge his own complaint against moshe sharvit over the incident we went to gil alexanders home in a kibbutz inside israel that overlooks the valley gunmen from the palestinian city of jenin fired at the kibbutz two years ago gil alexander is not a pacifist if he is attacked by hamas or any other group he will defend himself he said a son of our friends two months ago he was killed here by a terrorist he was a soldier in the reserves 46 years old with six children he volunteered for the reserves to protect me if the army hadnt been there they would have come here he was killed while defending me and today he is buried next to my two sons but gil alexander seemed weary as we sat drinking tea amid the bright red flowers of his welltended garden and the fluttering yellow flags that symbolise israels hostages held in gaza he spoke of a beloved nephew killed fighting in lebanon in an earlier war did he not i wondered at the age of 72 think about retiring from the struggle and enjoying his garden he laughed there was no chance of that after two of his sons took their own lives – one was in the army the other was about to enter the military – he had found a purpose in working for what he calls the humanitarian ideals of judaism after the tragedies of my sons if i dont find meaning in life ill go crazy… and the things i do are things i believe in and these are things i also got from my father who was in the french underground during world war two and fought for french liberation but was against any type of occupation and said

money for the us says economist karen young a senior fellow at the middle east institute think tank he wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go and some estimation of what they will do to the american economy in terms of job creation or his big push of course on domestic manufacturing trump is due to arrive in the saudi capital riyadh on tuesday 13

then ending his threeday trip in the united arab emirates uae on 15 may the economic importance of the region to trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to saudi arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the white house that was before the death of pope francis necessitated trump attending his funeral in rome towards the end of april saudi arabia was also the first

trump in washington yet ms young from the middle east institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term she instead says that they are longterm strategic moves and that the figures should be taken with a little bit of a grain of salt regarding specific deals that could be announced during trumps visit it is widely reported that saudi arabia will agree to buy more than 100bn of us arms and other military items these are said to include missiles radar systems and transport aircraft the us has been a longstanding arms supplier to saudi arabia but in 2021 the

expected that this process will improve immediately he adds artificial intelligence is the other topic that will dominate the agenda during mr trumps visit talks are expected to centre on attracting greater gulf investment into us tech firms and boosting the regions access to cuttingedge american semiconductors the uae and saudi arabia have been investing billions of dollars into tech and ai sectors as try to diversify their economies away from oil the emiratis in particular are keen to establish themselves as a global ai hub last week the trump administration scrapped the bidenera chip regulations that placed restrictions on exports of advanced us chips to more than 120 countries including the gulf states the white house is expected to draft new rules that would potentially involve direct negotiations with countries like the uae for the uae this is absolutely essential says ms young they are aggressively building out their ai capacity so for them getting access to us technology

has captured hearts and minds around the world 10 hours ago share save farouk chothia bbc news share save ibrahim traoréx a charismatic 37yearold burkina fasos military ruler capt ibrahim traoré has skilfully built the persona of a panafricanist leader determined to free his nation from what he regards as the clutches of western imperialism and neocolonialism his message has resonated across africa and beyond with his admirers seeing him as following in the footsteps of african heroes like burkina fasos very own thomas sankara a marxist revolutionary who is sometimes referred to as africas che guevara traorés impact is huge i have even heard politicians and authors in countries like kenya in east africa say this is it he is the man beverly ochieng a senior researcher at global consultancy firm control risks told the bbc his messages reflect the age we are living in when many africans are questioning the relationship with the west and why there is still so much poverty in such a resourcerich continent she said after seizing power in a coup in 2022 traorés regime ditched former colonial power france in favour of a strong alliance with russia that has included the deployment of a russian paramilitary brigade and adopted leftwing economic policies this included setting up a stateowned mining company requiring foreign firms to give it a 15 stake in their local operations and to transfer skills to burkinabé people the rule also applied to russian miner nordgold which was given a licence in late april for its latest investment in burkina fasos gold industry as part of what traoré calls a revolution to ensure burkina faso benefits from its mineral wealth the junta is also building a gold refinery and establishing national gold reserves for the first time in the nations history however westernowned firms appear to be facing a tough time with australiaheadquartered sarama resources launching arbitration proceedings against burkina faso in late 2024 following the withdrawal of an exploration licence the junta has also nationalised two gold mines previously owned by a londonlisted firm and said last month that it planned to take control of more foreignowned mines enoch randy aikins a researcher at south africas institute for security studies told the bbc that traorés radical reforms had increased his popularity in africa he is now arguably africas most popular if not favourite president mr aikins said afp support for westernstyle democracy has fallen in many african states research shows his popularity has been fuelled through social media including many misleading posts intended to bolster his revolutionary image aigenerated videos of music stars like r kelly rihanna justin bieber and beyoncé are seen immortalising him through song though they have done nothing of the sort ms ochieng said that traoré first caught the attention of africans when he spoke at the russiaafrica summit in 2023 telling african leaders to stop behaving like puppets who dance every time the imperialists pull the strings this speech was heavily publicised by russian media which has become a major player in promoting traorés panafricanist image thanks to his rhetoric and pushed by a slick social media campaign his appeal has spread around the world including among africanamericans and black britons ms ochieng noted everyone who has experienced racism colonialism and slavery can relate to his messages ms ochieng said pointing out that africanamerican rapper meek mill had posted about him on x late last year saying how much he liked his energy and heart though he was ridiculed for mixing up names by referring to traoré as burkina faso and later deleted the post but frances president is not a fan describing traoré as part of a baroque alliance between selfproclaimed panafricans and neoimperialists emmanuel macron was also referring to russia and china whom he accused in a 2023 speech of provoking coups in africas former french colonies and hypocritically stirring up old arguments over sovereignty and colonial exploitation traorés popularity comes despite the fact that he has failed to fulfil his pledge to quell a 10year islamist insurgency that has fuelled ethnic divisions and has now spread to oncepeaceful neighbours like benin his junta has also cracked down on dissent including the opposition media and civil society groups and punished critics among them medics and magistrates by sending them to the frontlines of the war against the jihadists afp thomas sankara who was killed in 1987 was praised by supporters for his integrity and selflessness and remains an icon for many in africa for rinaldo depagne the africa deputy director of the international crisis group thinktank traoré commands such support because he is young in a country with a young population the median age is 177 years he is mediasavvy and uses the past to build his popularity as a reincarnation of sankara he told the bbc and he knows the art of politics how to make a nation completely traumatised by war feel there is a better future he is really good at that game sankara rose to power in a coup in 1983 at the age of 33 rallied the nation under the motto fatherland or death we will win and was killed four years later in another coup that put burkina faso back in frances political orbit until traorés seizure of power ghanaian security analyst prof kwesi aning who previously worked at the kofi annan international peacekeeping training centre said the popularity of the military leader reflected a political shift taking place on the continent especially in west africa a 2024 survey in 39 countries by afrobarometer showed a drop in support for democracy although it remained the most popular form of government democracy has failed to give hope to the youth it has not delivered jobs or better education and health prof aning told the bbc he said traoré was offering an alternative and recapturing the spirit of two historic epochs the postindependence era when there were leaders like ghanas kwame nkrumah and kenneth kaunda of zambia kenneth kaunda of zambia and a later era with sankara and ghanas jerry rawlings whose coup in 1979 was also very popular at the time ibrahim traoréx capt traoré is at ease chatting to people here with agricultural workers in march it was traoré who stole the show at the inauguration of ghanas president john mahama in january when he arrived wearing battle fatigues with a pistol in his holster there were already 21 heads of state there but when traoré walked in the place lit up even my presidents bodyguards were running after him prof aning said traoré offered a sharply contrasting image to some of the continents other leaders who struggled to walk but clung to power by rigging elections he said traoré is stylish and confident with a very open face and a small smile he is also a powerful orator and presents himself as a man of the people in a sign that his russianallied junta has made some progress on the economic front the international monetary fund imf and world bank have given a generally upbeat assessment in a statement in early april the imf said that despite a challenging humanitarian and security environment the economy was expected to remain robust in 2025 and the regime had made commendable progress in raising domestic revenue containing the public wage bill and increasing spending on education health and social protection as for the world bank it said that inflation had surged from 07 in 2023 to 42 in 2024 but the extreme poverty rate which refers to people living on less than 215 £161 a day had fallen by almost two percentage points to 249 because of robust growth in the agriculture and services sectors despite these reports from usbased financial institutions relations with both france and america have been frosty a recent example being the claim by the head of the us africa command gen michael langley that traoré was using burkina fasos gold reserves for his juntas protection rather than the nations benefit this appeared to be a reference to the longstanding view of the us and some of its african allies that russian forces were propping up traoré in exchange for a stake in burkina fasos gold industry undermining the military rulers image as a leader who expelled french troops in 2023 to reclaim the countrys sovereignty gen langleys comments made in early april during a us senate committee hearing triggered an uproar among the captains supporters who felt their hero was being smeared this was further inflamed when shortly afterwards the burkinabé junta said it had foiled a coup plot alleging the plotters were based in neighbouring ivory coast where gen langley then made a visit afp a huge rally in support of capt traoré was held in ouagadougou on 30 april along with others in cities around the world including london ivory coast denied being involved in any plot while the us africa command said gen langleys visit had focused on addressing common security challenges including violent extremism but the junta took the opportunity to organise one of its biggest rallies in burkina fasos capital over fears that imperialists and their lackeys were trying to depose the captain because colin powell lied iraq was destroyed barack obama lied gaddafi was killed but this time their lies wont affect us one protester musician ocibi johann told the associated press news agency rallies in solidarity with traoré were also held abroad including in london on the same day he took to social media afterwards posting in french and english to express his gratitude to them for sharing his vision for a new burkina faso and a new africa adding together in solidarity we will defeat imperialism and neocolonialism for a free dignified and sovereign africa it is impossible to say how things will end for the young captain but he along with military leaders in mali and niger have certainly shaken up west africa and other states have followed their example by ordering french forces to leave the three militaryruled neighbours have also pulled out of the regional trade and security grouping ecowas formed their own alliance and have ended free trade in the region by announcing the imposition of a 05 tariff on goods coming into their countries mr aikins said traoré could learn from others pointing out that when rawlings took power in ghana at the age of 32 he was known as junior jesus but after 19 years he left a mixed legacy he had been unable to stem corruption despite helping to create an enduring democracy for a lasting legacy mr aikins said traoré should focus on achieving peace and building strong state institutions to bring about good governance rather than personalising power and cracking down on dissent you may also be interested in getty imagesbbc,,,,,,,,Fresh

enclave and getting aid flowing again to a suffering palestinian population the palestinian group released a statement on sunday “israeli soldier edan alexander a dual us national will be released as part of the steps taken towards a ceasefire reopen the crossings and deliver aid and relief to our people in the gaza strip” israel has blocked all aid going into gaza including food medicine and fuel for 70 days the hamas statement did not indicate when the 21yearold alexander would be released but it is thought to be in the coming 48 hours israeli media reported that us envoy steve witkoff will be in israel on monday as part of the deal the announcement comes shortly before us president donald trump’s visit to the middle east this week – which does not include a trip to israel trump and witkoff have frequently mentioned alexander by name in the past few months advertisement witkoff later confirmed hamas had agreed to release alexander in the hopes of restarting ceasefire talks alexander who grew up in the us was taken from his military base during the october 7 2023 hamasled attack in its statement on sunday hamas said it was willing to “immediately begin intensive

reconstruction and the end of the blockade” the group said qatar and egypt the two main mediators welcomed hamas’ announcement saying they considered the group’s move a gesture of goodwill and an encouraging step toward the parties’ return to ceasefire negotiations israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s office said on sunday that the us told israel that hamas’s freeing of alexander would lead to negotiations for the release of more captives the statement added that israel’s policy hasn’t changed negotiations will be conducted under fire with a continued commitment to achieving all war objectives ‘a lot of questions’ al jazeera’s hamdah salhut reporting from amman jordan said “it’s unclear exactly what kind of reaction the israeli government officials had with these direct talks between hamas and the united states but last time they were quite angry and that’s because the israelis weren’t involved and had no knowledge of those talks and the americans hit back by saying they didn’t need anyone’s permission to negotiate with any of the actors involved because they were american captives held in gaza” advertisement “there are a lot of questions from a lot of different angles specifically from the family members of those captives from the larger part of israeli society who have been protesting in the thousands for more than 15 years accusing benjamin netanyahu of prolonging the war for his own personal and political gain and in fact israeli officials have been saying the quiet part out loud in recent weeks saying that the captives were not the main priority for the israeli government and that they had other goals and objectives they needed to achieve” she added “the family members of captives say that the israeli government is choosing land grabs over the lives of israelis who are still being held in gaza” she continued referring to the israeli government’s decision to expand its offensive in gaza with a view to reoccupying parts of the territory

A0882,2025-05-11,1,I'm 50 With $650K in a 401(k). Should I Max Out the 24% Bracket With Annual Roth Conversions?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/im-50-650k-401-k-145524599.html,when you make a roth conversion you add the entire amount converted to your taxable income for that year for example say that you convert 100000 from your 401k to a roth ira in 2024 your taxable income for 2024 would increase by 100000 this means that part of making a roth conversion is ensuring you have the cash on hand to pay the increased taxes if you are over the age of 59 12 you can take that cash from the funds you are converting which will in turn reduce your portfolios capital if not you will need cash from other sources roth conversions are when you move money from an existing qualified pretax retirement account like a 401k or a traditional ira and put it in a roth ira there is no limit to how much money you can convert so long as it comes from a qualified pretax portfolio mechanically this is a simple transfer you either direct deposit the assets from one account to the other or you withdraw the funds and then deposit them in the other account a roth ira is a posttax retirement account this means that you fund it with money on which you have already paid income taxes you get no tax breaks related to funding the roth account however you then pay no further taxes on these assets the funds grow taxfree like with all retirement accounts and in retirement you can withdraw this money with no income taxes this can make a roth ira the best retirement account on the market for the right investor here are some things to think about a financial advisor can also give you personalized guidance based on your circumstances and goals for example say that youre 50 years old with 650000 in your 401k a roth ira will have plenty of time to keep growing tax free before you retire in say 10 to 15 years how would it work if you move just enough income each year to stay under the midtier 24 tax bracket how about if you move enough to stay within 24 if youre making a roth conversion you’ll incur conversion taxes a good way to help manage this is by staggering your conversions moving a little bit at a time to minimize your tax brackets under the right circumstances a roth ira can be the best retirement account for tax management on the back end you simply cant beat the offer of no income taxes or required minimum distributions rmds in retirement the catch is the front end when you pay taxes that might otherwise have boosted your portfolio story continues staggered roth conversions the most common way to manage conversion taxes is a practice known as staggered conversions this is when you convert money in smaller amounts each year to keep your taxable income lower this in turn helps keep down your tax brackets so that your money gets taxed at a lower overall effective rate for example lets say you have 100000 to convert using the 2024 tax brackets as an example the 12 tax bracket applies to individual income between 11600 and 47150 the 22 tax bracket begins at income above 47150 for the sake of example we can set aside any other household income if you convert 100000 all at once you will pay taxes up to 22 for an approximate effective rate of 1379 and taxes of 13007 on the other hand say you convert your money over in 47150 installments with a 5700 remainder in the third year this would expose your money to a maximum 12 tax rate for an effective rate of 801 and total taxes of 7552 you almost halve your taxes with staggered installment conversions as opposed to a lump sum in this case however when it comes to installment conversions many investors forget a critical issue your money will continue growing while you make these conversions for the roth account this means that the sooner you convert your funds the more untaxed growth you will enjoy for the pretax account this means that the longer you take to convert your funds the more taxed money you will ultimately need to convert a financial advisor can help you plan and execute a roth conversion get matched today how should you convert a 650000 401k so lets return to our question youre 50 years old with 650000 in your 401k well assume that you are an unmarried individual and that your portfolio grows at a stable 8 mixedasset rate of return there are no guarantees with investing we will just use this number for the sake of example first should you convert your money each year up to the 24 income bracket it’ll depend on your circumstances including the other taxable income you are living on each year the 24 tax bracket ends at 191950 in our example so you will need to keep your combined earned and converted taxable income at or below this number to stay below the 32 bracket or say you want to make this conversion over 10 years so that it is finished by the time you turn 60 to do this you will need to account both for your current portfolio and any growth during that time while still balancing your tax brackets by monitoring your earned and converted income so in the alternative should you convert your money each year to stay within the 24 tax bracket that is should you convert only enough to stay within this bracket this plan makes sense but depending on your income it might still be tight the 24 bracket is one of the tax codes odd cliffs with the next bracket jumping all the way up to 32 so youll save real money by sticking to 24 however you still need to consider your timeline if you want to convert your money in less than 10 years even staying within 24 might require an unrealistically low level of earned income for example say that you want to convert this entire portfolio within five years this would require withdrawals of slightly more than 160000 per year accounting for portfolio growth thats only possible if you make less than 31950 per year within the 24 tax bracket this plan is possible but it depends entirely on your time frame if you want to convert your assets before age 60 this still might require less household income than youre likely to have consider speaking with a financial advisor for help building and executing a plan for your retirement income and taxes the bottom line a roth ira conversion can be a great way to manage your taxes but its important to fully understand the implications of this move for example when you plan the timeline of your conversion dont forget to account for offsetting portfolio growth otherwise you might find yourself relying on unrealistic assumptions tips on retirement portfolio tax management

Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/11/india-and-pakistan-both-claim-victory-after-ceasefire-declared,india and pakistan have both claimed victory after a ceasefire was declared over the weekend which brought the two nuclearnations back from the brink of war after days of escalating clashes that culminated in both sides launching missile and drone strikes on each other’s major military bases – the closest they had come to fullscale war in decades – the ceasefire between india and pakistan was declared by donald trump on saturday evening on sunday trump further congratulated the two countries on “having the strength wisdom and fortitude to fully know and understand that it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many and so much” within hours of the truce announcement there were fears it had fallen apart after firing restarted along the disputed border in kashmir and missiles and drones were once again launched into indianadministered kashmir however by sunday morning things were quiet on both sides of the frontier leading many to hope the fragile peace would hold each side accused the other of triggering the violations and pakistan said it remained “committed to faithful implementation of ceasefire” the indian army said in a press briefing it had conveyed a message through its “hotline” with pakistan that if there were any more crossborder provocations “our firm and clear intent to respond to these fiercely” both india and pakistan claimed the ceasefire as a victory fuelling a surge of nationalistic fervour on both sides of the border india’s defence minister rajnath singh said on sunday the “roar of indian forces reached rawalpindi the very headquarters of the pakistani army” referring to india’s missile strikes on pakistan’s nur khan airbase he said the military offensive named operation sindoor was “not just a military action but a symbol of india’s political social and strategic willpower” in pakistan parades were held near the border to shower the military with petals and the prime minister shehbaz sharif declared 11 may to be a day “in recognition of the armed forces’ response to recent indian aggression” writing in pakistan’s dawn newspaper commentator baqir sajjad called the ceasefire a “calculated victory” by pakistan that “firmly denied a much stronger india the military edge and diplomatic narrative it sought to dominate” parties and rallies were held across the country to mark the day particularly in pakistancontrolled kashmir which was on the frontline of weeks of aggressive crossborder shelling raja farooq haider khan a former leader of pakistancontrolled kashmir led a celebratory rally near the disputed kashmir border “we are celebrating the bravery of our armed forces today who defended us” he said he offered his gratitude to trump for helping to resolve the conflict “this time we were so close to war so his involvement was very welcome but we have to say that without resolving the kashmir issue longterm peace can’t prevail in the region” sahad a resident in neelum valley in pakistancontrolled kashmir said the past few days had been the scariest of her life “no one can be happier than us as we live under the shadow of border posts and indian firings everyone is happy to have our normal lives back” she said there were also celebrations on the indian side of the border however residents near the disputed frontier said that while a ceasefire was welcome it did not solve the underlying problem of the often bloody dispute between india and pakistan over the himalayan region of kashmir which goes back to the partition of india in 1947 lal din 55 a resident of poonch the worstaffected area along india’s border in kashmir where hundreds of houses were destroyed and dozens killed in the crossborder fire said kashmiris has seen this same situation – “temporary ceasefires brokered by global powers” – many times before “the core issue remains unresolved – soldiers still face each other with weapons and tanks” he said “today it was one dispute tomorrow it will be another and the guns will roar again trapping civilians like me in the crossfire we’re just numbers in this clash of nuclear powers i beg both sides resolve your differences live in peace and let us live” after weeks of mounting tensions the attacks this week began on wednesday when indian missiles struck nine sites in pakistan killing 31 people india has said those strikes were aimed at “terrorist infrastructure and terrorist training camps” as retribution for an attack in indianadministered kashmir late last month in which militants killed 25 hindu tourists and a guide which it blamed on pakistanibacked extremists the situation escalated further after india accused pakistan of two consecutive nights of drone attacks the us took sizeable credit for brokering saturday’s ceasefire with marco rubio the secretary of state and jd vance the vicepresident reported to have spent 48 hours embroiled in intense diplomatic negotiations with the two countries finally convincing them to lay down arms on saturday other countries including saudi arabia and the uk were also credited vance had initially said the us would not interfere in the escalating hostilities between the us and pakistan claiming it was “none of our business” however according to sources their attitude shifted after concerns were raised by us intelligence that the conflict posed a risk of escalating into a full nuclear threat the reportedly proactive role played by the us in the ceasefire including phone calls made by trump himself seemed to have piqued the president’s interest in the subcontinent and he pledged to substantially increase trade with both india and pakistan at a press briefing on sunday indian military spokespeople offered more details on its offensive against pakistan and claimed it was pakistan that had first requested a ceasefire india said five of its soldiers were killed by pakistani firing over the border and claimed pakistan lost about 40 solders in firing along the line of control it also claimed to have killed 100 terrorists living over the border in pakistan the numbers could not be verified it also claimed to have “downed a few pakistani planes” though it did not elaborate further asked about claims made by pakistan and backed up by expert analysis of debris that pakistani missiles had downed at least three indian military jets during the offensive on wednesday including multimilliondollar

Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/us-china-trade-talks-geneva-intended-de-escalate-tensions-lutnick,the white house has announced that a trade deal with china has been struck after two days of talks in geneva while beijing has hailed “important first steps” the announcement on sunday came after the us treasury secretary scott bessent told reporters that there had been “substantial progress” in talks between his team and that of the chinese vicepremier he lifeng in geneva on defusing the trade war between the world’s two largest economies sparked by donald trump’s 145 tariffs at a news conference later on sunday he the top chinese trade official called the talks “candid” and said substantive progress had been made to reach an “important consensus” according to china’s staterun media the two sides will issue a joint statement agreed during the talks on monday the vicepremier said in televised remarks that were posted on social media by the white house bessent said he would give more details on monday “but i can tell you that the talks were productive” the us trade representative jamieson greer who spoke alongside bessent suggested more strongly that a deal had been reached “it’s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought” greer said “just remember why we’re here in the first place” he added “the united states has a massive 12tn trade deficit so the president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs and we’re confident that the deal we struck with our chinese partners will help us to resolve work toward resolving that national emergency” the two sides have agreed to set up a joint mechanism focused on “regular and irregular communications related to trade and commercial issues” china’s international trade representative li chenggang said asked if a communique on the talks would arrive before financial markets opened li replied “if the dishes are delicious timing is not a matter … whenever released it is going to be big good news” he said the meeting was the first facetoface interaction between bessent greer and he since the world’s two largest economies imposed tariffs well above 100 on each other’s goods financial markets have been on edge for signs of a thaw in the trade war that has already begun to disrupt supply chains prompt layoffs and raise wholesale prices although bessent has said the bilateral tariffs were too high and needed to come down in a deescalation move he did not offer any details of reductions agreed and took no questions from reporters on saturday night trump wrote on his social media platform that the two sides were working on “a total reset … in a friendly but constructive manner” “many things discussed much agreed to” trump posted “we want to see for the good of both china and the us an opening up of china to american business great progress made” trump added trump’s rhetoric that china needs to be “opened” to us business seemed to ignore a half century of trade between the two nations since one of his political heroes richard nixon visited china in 1972 the us commerce secretary howard lutnick confirmed to cnn that the us will continue to keep “a 10 baseline tariff to be in place for the foreseeable future” even on imports from nations the us strikes new trade deals with on sunday kevin hassett the director of the national economic council said “what’s going to happen in all likelihood is that relationships are going to be rebooted it looks like the chinese are very very eager to play ball and renormalise things … they really want to rebuild a relationship that’s great for both of us” last week trump and the uk prime minister keir starmer announced a limited bilateral trade deal hassett said the uk agreement provided a “really exciting blueprint” and that he had been briefed on 24 deals with other countries that are in the works “they all look a little bit like the uk deal but each one is bespoke” he said meanwhile lutnick dismissed reports of dock workers and truckers losing their jobs as a result of the tariffs “this is just a china problem right now” lutnick said “the rest of the world is 10 tariffs so don’t overdo it” “prices are going to stay stable once this policy is done” lutnick added the fact the talks are even happening “is good news for business and for the financial markets” gary hufbauer a senior nonresident fellow at the peterson institute for international economics said in an interview while the talks were ongoing but hufbauer cautioned he was “very sceptical that there will be any return to something like normal uschina trade relations” even a tariff rate of 7080 would still potentially halve bilateral trade he said “the devil will be in the details” said cutler from aspi “without the details it’s hard to assess whether the meeting was successful or not” reuters contributed

Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/12/staff-layoffs-in-uk-gain-pace-amid-trump-tariff-turmoil-and-labour-cost-increases,uk employers laid off staff in april at a faster pace than the previous month as the combination of higher employment costs and shock waves from donald trump’s tariff war sent boardroom confidence levels plummeting the human resources association cipd said employer confidence levels slumped to an alltime low prompting job cuts and a widespread hiring freeze higher national insurance contributions nics and the rise in the national living wage which both came into effect in april and the uncertainty created by the us president’s import duties were blamed by employers for ending signs of optimism earlier in the year the drop in confidence levels was matched by the fall to a record low outside the pandemic in the number of uk employers expecting to increase headcount in the next three months cipd records go back to 2014 a separate survey of small and mediumsized businesses by the business advisory firm bdo revealed a similar picture the firm said a decline in output in april by manufacturing and services firms underscored the pressure facing businesses “with confidence levels now at their weakest point in four years comparable to levels seen during the national lockdowns” the chancellor rachel reeves will hope the surveys – which were completed before last week’s cut in interest rates by the bank of england and the uk trade agreements with the us and india – will show a rebound in confidence during the summer reeves has said that growing the economy is her no 1 priority and that she needs firms to be more optimistic if they are to increase investment and expand production however the cipd said a recovery could not be guaranteed when employers were likely to be faced with extra costs from the government’s employment rights bill which added another layer of uncertainty to an already difficult outlook james cockett senior labour market economist at the cipd said “the employment rights bill is landing in a fundamentally different landscape to the one expected when it formed part of the labour manifesto in summer of last year “it was always going to be a huge change for employers but they’re operating in an even more complex world now it’s vital the government works closely with employers to balance the very real risk of reductions in investment in people training and technology with their desire to reduce poor employment practice” the cipd’s latest labour market outlook report based on a survey of 2000 employers showed the rate of firms expecting to increase headcount had fallen sharply among large private sector employers and in retail in particular an index of employment fell from 13 in the last quarter to 8 in the latest quarter the balance tumbled furthest in the public sector which fell into negative territory from 3 to 4 in the private sector retail companies were the worst affected another survey by the accountants kpmg and the recruitment and employment confederation which represents jobs agencies found demand for staff weakened in april in line with a steady decline over the past 18 months “the rate of contraction quickened slightly since march but remained softer than seen earlier in the year” it said adding “underlying data pointed to similarly sharp falls in both permanent and temporary vacancies” skip past newsletter promotion sign up to business today free daily newsletter get set for the working day – well point you to all the business news and analysis you

forces have broken years of silence to give bbc panorama eyewitness accounts of alleged war crimes committed by colleagues in iraq and afghanistan giving their accounts publicly for the first time the veterans described seeing members of the sas murder unarmed people in their sleep and execute handcuffed detainees including children they handcuffed a young boy and shot him recalled one veteran who served with the sas in afghanistan he was clearly a child not even close to fighting age killing of detainees became routine the veteran said theyd search someone handcuff them then shoot them before cutting off the plastic handcuffs used to restrain people and planting a pistol by the body he said the new testimony includes allegations of war crimes stretching over more than a decade far longer than the three years currently being examined by a judgeled public inquiry in the uk the sbs the royal navys elite special forces regiment is also implicated for the first time in the most serious allegations executions of unarmed and wounded people a veteran who served with the sbs said some troops had a mob mentality describing their behaviour on operations as barbaric i saw the quietest guys switch show serious psychopathic traits he said they were lawless they felt untouchable special forces were deployed to afghanistan to protect british troops from taliban fighters and bombmakers the conflict was a deadly one for members of the uks armed forces – 457 lost their lives and thousands more were wounded asked by the bbc about the new eyewitness testimony the ministry of defence said that it was fully committed to supporting the ongoing public inquiry into the alleged war crimes and that it urged all veterans with relevant information to come forward it said that it was not appropriate for the mod to comment on allegations which may be in the inquirys scope psychotic murderers in the regiment the eyewitness testimony offers the most detailed public account of the killings to date from former members of uk special forces uksf the umbrella group which contains the sas sbs and several supporting regiments the testimony from more than 30 people who served with or alongside uk special forces builds on years of reporting by bbc panorama into allegations of extrajudicial killings by the sas panorama can also reveal for the first time that then prime minister david cameron was repeatedly warned during his tenure that uk special forces were killing civilians in afghanistan speaking on condition of anonymity because of a de facto code of silence around special forces operations the eyewitnesses told the bbc that the laws of war were being regularly and intentionally broken by the countrys most elite regiments during operations in both iraq and afghanistan those laws state that on such operations people can be deliberately killed only when they pose a direct threat to the lives of british troops or others but members of the sas and sbs were making their own rules the eyewitnesses said if a target had popped up on the list two or three times before then wed go in with the intention of killing them there was no attempt to capture them said one veteran who served with the sas referring to people who had been previously captured questioned and then released sometimes wed check wed identified the target confirm their id then shoot them he said often the squadron would just go and kill all the men they found there one witness who served with the sas said that killing could become an addictive thing to do and that some members of the elite regiment were intoxicated by that feeling in afghanistan there were lots of psychotic murderers he said getty images then prime minister david cameron r was made aware by the then afghan president hamid karzai l of allegations of civilian killings the bbc has been told on some operations the troop would go into guesthousetype buildings and kill everyone there he said theyd go in and shoot everyone sleeping there on entry its not justified killing people in their sleep a veteran who served with the sbs told the bbc that after bringing an area under control assault teams would sweep through the area shooting anyone on the ground checking the bodies and killing anyone left alive it was expected not hidden everyone knew he said intentionally killing wounded people who do not pose a threat would be a clear breach of international law but the sbs veteran told panorama that wounded people were routinely killed he described one operation during which a medic was treating someone who had been shot but was still breathing then one of our blokes came up to him there was a bang hed been shot in the head at pointblank range he said the killings were completely unnecessary he added these are not mercy killings its murder more junior members of assault teams were told by more senior sas operators to kill male detainees according to the testimony using instructions such as hes not coming back to base with us or this detainee you make sure he doesnt come off target detainees were people who had surrendered been searched by special forces and were typically handcuffed british and international law forbid troops from deliberately killing unarmed civilians or prisoners of war a former sas operator also described learning of an operation in iraq during which someone was executed it was pretty clear from what i could glean that he posed no threat he wasnt armed its disgraceful theres no professionalism in that the former operator said the killing was never properly investigated he added according to the sas veteran the problem started long before the regiment moved across to afghanistan and senior commanders were aware of that one sas veteran said that killing could be an addictive thing to do the testimony as well as new video evidence obtained by the bbc from sas operations in iraq in 2006 also supports previous reporting by panorama that sas squadrons kept count of their kills to compete with one another sources told the bbc that some members of the sas kept their own individual counts and that one operator personally killed dozens of people on one sixmonth tour of afghanistan it seemed like he was trying to get a kill on every operation every night someone got killed a former colleague said the operator was notorious in the squadron he genuinely seemed like a psychopath the former colleague added in one incident that sources say became infamous inside the sas the operator allegedly slit the throat of an injured afghan man after telling an officer not to shoot the man again it was because he wanted to go and finish the wounded guy off with his knife another former colleague said he wanted to you know blood his knife knowledge of the alleged crimes was not confined to small teams or individual squadrons according to the testimony within the uk special forces command structure everyone knew what was happening said one veteran im not taking away from personal responsibility but everyone knew he said there was implicit approval for what was happening to avoid scrutiny of the killings eyewitnesses said members of the sas and sbs would plant socalled drop weapons on the bodies of the dead to make it look as though they had been armed in the photographs routinely taken by special forces teams at the scene there was a fake grenade theyd take with them onto target it couldnt detonate said a former sas operator another veteran said operators would carry ak47 rifles which had a folding stock because they were easier to fit into their rucksacks and easier to bring onto a target and plant by a body reports were fiction officers would then help to falsify postoperational reports in order to avoid scrutiny for the actions of assault teams on the ground according to the testimony we understood how to write up serious incident reviews so they wouldnt trigger a referral to the military police one of the veterans said if it looked like a shooting could represent a breach of the rules of conflict youd get a phone call from the legal adviser or one of the staff officers in hq theyd pick you up on it and help you to clarify the language do you remember someone making a sudden move oh yeah i do now that sort of thing it was built into the way we operated the reports were a fiction another uksf veteran said an intelligence officer who worked with the sbs described reports which said they had been caught in a firefight while the photos showed bodies with multiple clean headshots falsified paperwork could help prevent an investigation by the royal military police but british special forces operations generated deep concern from afghan commanders and afghan government officials david cameron who made seven visits to afghanistan as prime minister between june 2010 and november 2013 the period now under scrutiny by the sas public inquiry was repeatedly made aware of the concerns by afghan president hamid karzai according to multiple people who attended the meetings mr karzai consistently repeatedly mentioned this issue former afghan national security adviser dr rangin dadfar spanta told panorama he said lord cameron could have been left in no doubt that there were allegations of civilians including children being killed during operations carried out by uk special forces former director of service prosecutions bruce houlder said he hoped the inquiry would examine what mr cameron knew the afghan president was so consistent with his complaints about night raids civilian casualties and detentions that there was no senior western diplomat or military leader who would have missed the fact that this was a major irritant for him said gen douglas lute a former us ambassador to nato gen lute said it would have been extraordinarily unusual if there were a claim against british forces that the british chain of command was not aware of a spokesperson for lord cameron told panorama that to the best of lord camerons recollection the issues raised by president karzai were about nato forces in general and that specific incidents with respect to uk special forces were not raised the spokesperson also said that it was right that we await the official findings of the inquiry adding that any suggestion that lord cameron colluded in covering up allegations of serious criminal wrongdoing is total nonsense unlike many other countries including the us and france the uk has no parliamentary oversight of its elite special forces regiments strategic responsibility for their actions falls ultimately to the prime minister along with the defence secretary and head of special forces bruce houlder kc a former director of service prosecutions responsible for bringing charges and prosecuting those serving in the armed forces told panorama that he hoped the public inquiry would examine the extent of lord camerons knowledge of alleged civilian casualties on british special forces operations you need to know how far the rot went up mr houlder said,,,,,,,,Fresh

A0901,2025-05-12,0,The real problem facing Britain's depleted armed forces,BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd4lp6w378o,the real problem facing britains shrinking military 2 hours ago share save jonathan beale • bealejonathan defence correspondent share save bbc on a march day this year a british nucleararmed submarine quietly returned to its base on the west coast of scotland after a recordbreaking 204 days underwater hms vanguard had 130 crew members on board they had spent nearly seven months without fresh air or daylight and with little communication patrols of the uks nucleararmed submarines are supposed to last no longer than three months but the last eight patrols have all exceeded five months as the navys ageing fleet of submarines requires ever more time in maintenance it means the submariners on board are spending longer and longer underwater a submariner who was on board one of those long patrols described to me a worrying situation in which the crew ran low on food and medicines towards the end of the patrol he described how hungry crew members rummaged for tins of food in hidden compartments inside the submarine he said they even had to make bread out of custard powder because theyd run out of flour the navy has long found it difficult to recruit sailors into its submarine service often known as the silent service but the case of the 204day patrol by hms vanguard raises a wider issue crown copyright keir starmer visits one of the royal navys vanguard class submarines virtually everyone agrees that britains armed forces are depleted troop numbers are down morale is weak and some ageing equipment is in a poor state and all this comes at a time of greater geopolitical uncertainty as the threat from russia looms large across europe within the next few months the government will publish its longawaited strategic defence review a consultation launched by sir keir starmer shortly after he arrived in downing street last summer designed to identify threats to britain and recommend how the armed forces can meet them but there are already doubts over how much it can realistically achieve so as the world becomes more dangerous what can the government do to reverse the decline and restore the uk to military readiness dwindling troop numbers politicians from all sides along with military chiefs admit britains armed forces have been hollowed out its true for the royal navy and the raf and perhaps most acutely in the british army in 2010 the regular army was nearly 110000 strong now it is struggling to meet its target of 73000 soldiers not enough to fill cardiffs principality stadium earlier this year defence minister and former royal marine al carns told a conference at the royal united services institute a think tank that the entire british army could be expended within six to 12 months if it fought a war on a similar scale to the ukraine conflict last summer the head of the army general sir roly walker said the army needed to be ready to fight a war by 2027 an admission it isnt ready to fight one in its current state he said the army needs to leverage technology such as drones new software and artificial intelligence getty images europe in 2010 the regular army was nearly 110000 strong today it would struggle to fill cardiffs principality stadium but justin crump an army reserve officer who heads the risk and intelligence company sibylline argues that boosts to technology wont make up for the lack of military hardware we have big gaps and theyre not going to get filled overnight he says the government is also promising to streamline the bureaucratic process of ordering new kit trying to learn the painful lessons of past mistakes by the time they eventually arrive the delivery of hundreds of new ajax armoured vehicles will have taken more than a decade weaknesses in its nato commitments speak to any government minister about security theyll no doubt talk about nato its the cornerstone of the uks security the government says and one that has only become more important since russias invasion of ukraine according to its nato commitments the uk is supposed to be able to field tens of thousands of troops at short notice to defend any nato territory – with a warfighting division made up of tanks artillery and heavy armour but a former senior general told the bbc that in a real war it would run out of ammunition spares and supplies within weeks or even days nor does britain have much in terms of groundbased air defences – not enough to protect key military bases in the uk yet alone its towns and cities the weaknesses in britains contribution to nato became starkly apparent in february this year when a group of british mps visited a nato military site in tapa estonia where british soldiers are deployed alongside danish and french troops the point of the base is to deter or slow down an invasion from russia which is just 80 miles away over a land border mike martin a liberal democrat mp and former british army officer said the estonia visit was like going back in time seeing the same equipment as when he first joined the army as a reservist in 2004 ageing challenger 2 tanks and warrior armoured vehicles what one former general described to me as legacy kit from the 1980s old and dwindling in numbers about 1000 british troops are stationed at the site at the time of the mps visit they were armed with some drones though not many nor did they have much in the way of systems to block or jam enemy drones either they also have a handful of longrange artillery guns important for land warfare the british army currently has a total of just 14 even tiny estonia has double that number defence sources say that since the mps visit the army has now begun to test some of the new technology it wants to introduce they say it will help soldiers see further and strike faster afpgetty images talk of a future british troop deployment to ukraine following a possible ceasefire could pose a major challenge for the armed forces talk of thousands of british troops being sent to ukraine for a lengthy deployment if there were to be a ceasefire in its war with russia would present another huge challenge in the recent past the british army has just about managed to sustain a prolonged military campaign but in afghanistan between 2006 and 2014 it was only fighting lightly armed taliban insurgents even then it was stretched with nine thousand troops being constantly rotated every six months crump says afghanistan was painful enough and we had 20000 more people while he says providing a reassurance force for ukraine might be doable – it would rapidly wear us down questions over the price tag the government says it is addressing these challenges with its strategic defence review john healey the defence secretary claims it will lead to the biggest shake up of uk defence for over 50 years but past reviews have rarely lived up to expectation – not least because the money available rarely matches ambitions most reviews are quickly overtaken by events harold wilsons defence review of 1966 was overtaken just three years later by a crisis in northern ireland whilst tony blairs review of 1998 came just three years before 911 indeed when work on this review began the us under president joe biden was still the uks closest and most reliable military partner now thats less clear getty images europe defence spending was expected to be capped at 25 of gdp but some have questioned whether that would be enough there are also questions over the price tag the reviews terms of reference assumes that defence spending will be capped at 25 of the uks national income or gross domestic product gdp but few in defence believe thatll be enough one of the independent experts leading the review general sir richard barrons has already said the uk should be spending at least 3 of gdp on its armed forces meanwhile natos secretary general mark rutte is pressing allies to increase defence spending to north of 3 president donald trump has gone even higher urging nato countries to spend 5 the governments ambition is to boost spending to 3 at some time in the next parliament which will have the added bonus of boosting growth ministers say just last week sir keir said that extra investment will create a defence dividend for jobs and prosperity others think the review is too narrow in focus a former military chief told the bbc that a review should first identify threats to the uk and then work out how to shape the armed forces it was bonkers they added to conduct a defence review without it being nested in a broader crossgovernment security review reuters john healey claims the strategic defence review will lead to the biggest shake up of uk defence for over 50 years an mod spokesperson said that boosts to defence spending will make britain stronger and safer in an insecure world and will help us build a modern and resilient armed forces with cuttingedge capabilities the defence review they added is wideranging and working at pace looking hard at the threats we face and all the capabilities we need to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century low morale and cases of harassment attempts to broaden the armys appeal including highprofile recruitment campaigns targeting the socalled snowflake generation have not been enough to reverse the decline nor have a series of slick television adverts called belonging which aim to highlight the camaraderie of life in the forces last year the uks armed forces were losing 300 more fulltime personnel each month than theyd been recruiting in a mod survey last year nearly six in ten military personnel rated morale as low just four in 10 said they were satisfied with service life – the lowest since records began this government is trying to boost morale by improving military accommodation plus last years pay rise of 6 for armed forces personnel was the largest in two decades part of the problem is a broader cultural one fewer people have an emotional connection with the armed forces crump says the average briton is now more likely to know someone in jail than serving in the military he adds last year the army apologised to kerryann knight a black female soldier who fronted army recruitment campaigns after she described years of racist abuse and bullying that made her life while serving a living hell high profile stories of bullying and sexual harassment within the military cant have helped particularly for women and minorities the mod has set a recruiting goal of 30 women by 2030 but they currently make up less than 12 of the regular armed forces a figure which has hardly shifted in a decade getty images europe women make up just under 12 of the regular armed forces a figure that has hardly shifted in a decade britain is not alone in struggling to fill its ranks its a problem experienced by many western nations relying on volunteers some governments have now introduced some form of conscription in march polish prime minister donald tusk announced a plan to make all polish men undergo compulsory military training but there appears to be little appetite for conscription among the british public a yougov poll in september 2023 found that just 28 of the british public would support a one year military service younger people were particularly opposed the government wants to get people interested from a young age by expanding cadet forces in secondary schools the mod is also trying to keep better records of those troops who have left and who could be recalled in a crisis an mod spokesperson said we are committed to fixing armed forces recruitment and have already given personnel the largest pay rise in decades scrapped 100 outdated recruitment policies and passed legislation through the commons to introduce a new armed forces commissioner to improve service

hungrier we become 7 hours ago share save mark savage music correspondent share save sarah louise bennett remember monday will represent the uk at the eurovision song contest in switzerland this week lr charlotte steele lauren byrne and hollyanne hull since remember monday were announced as the uks eurovision act in march theyve barely slept in their own beds its definitely in the single digits says singer hollyanne hull trying to calculate how many nights she has spent at home we dont have time for that instead theyve been on a whirlwind tour of europe meeting fans filming endless tiktoks and performing their song what the hell just happened to anyone wholl listen if theyre tired it doesnt show the countrypop trio – lauren byrne hollyanne hull and charlotte steele – are chatty excited and focused on fun and for good reason they formed at school over a decade ago and determinedly stayed together during long periods where in their words noone was listening even after a successful turn on the voice in 2019 charlotte had to return to her job as a deputy head teacher while lauren and hollyanne appeared in west end shows like phantom of the opera and six the musical eurovision offers chance to change that they head to basel switzerland this week hoping to erase the memories of olly alexander and mae muller who both finished at the bottom end of the table it helps that remember mondays song is a certified banger full of glittery glampop flourishes and sizzling harmonies that crucially they can pull off live just before they set off for euroland we sat down with the trio to discuss quitting their jobs overcoming phobias and the dreaded nul points the band have travelled all over europe to promote their eurovision song what the hell just happened its eight weeks since you were announced as the uks eurovision entry… charlotte no it cant be it feels like six years how many air miles have you racked up in that time lauren honestly i feel bad about our carbon footprint charlotte the thing is im a nervous flyer i always put an eye mask on put my headphones in and avoid looking out the window then we had to catch a propellor plane from reykjavik in iceland and as it was taking off the whole thing was shaking from side to side lauren it was really treacherous… but then the next easyjet flight we had to catch charlotte was like what a breeze charlotte i was smiling talking its like i was cured when i first heard what the hell just happened i thought it sounded like something from six the musical… then i discovered youd actually been in it lauren that was me i was jane seymour shes the one that died instead of being beheaded was it always the plan to put a musical theatre vibe in the song lauren we wrote a brief for the song and there were so many references bohemian rhapsody chappell roan sabrina carpenter but we also said lets not be afraid to write the pop version of defying gravity we wanted it to have all that epicness and drama and the west end tricks you dont get in pop music your guide to all 37 of this year’s eurovision entries how to win eurovision according to the experts johann persson manuel harlan among the bands west end credits are phantom of the opera where hollyanne played christine daaé and matilda where lauren played miss honey you wrote 15 songs in total what were the rejects like hollyanne there are a few well definitely keep for our album but there was also one called achilles heel that went straight in the bin charlotte and lauren singing how do you feel achilles how is your heel achilles hollyanne cringing wed been writing for three weeks and i think we started to go delusional that reminds me of something ed sheeran says about songwriting a tap has to run brown before it runs clear charlotte its so true and funnily enough what the hell just happened was the last song we wrote a day before the deadline wed got to the point where we were like lets just go 100 on every idea and see where it lands hollyanne we thought we had the eurovision song i would say four or five times then this one came up and we were like ok its beaten all of them what can you tell me about your performance hollyanne we come from theatre background so its definitely going to be theatrical we want to give that a girlband concert feeling like youre stepping into the world of remember monday theres a line in the song about ripping your dress is that a sneaky bucks fizz reference lauren oh my god lets say yes we didnt write it specifically with that in mind but if the shoe fits charlotte theres loads of little easter eggs in the lyrics about our friendship weve had a lot of nights out that ended in a tattoo parlour or losing a shoe somehow ebu the trios eurovision set will include a fallen chandelier and a mock boudoir while their pastelcoloured costumes have been described as bridgerton meets moulin rouge do you remember the first time you met hollyanne its impossible to tell because we were in the same sixth form but for the first year we were in different classes lauren i remember charlotte coming into my class and singing that song from parade charlotte singing you dont know this maaan hollyanne then in the second year we all joined the same performing arts class and we were like oh lets sing together when you graduated you all had fulltime jobs – so how did you keep the band together charlotte we always had mondays off… hence the band name hollyanne it was so important to us to keep the band alive that we just never let it die charlotte at one point holly went on tour for a year and we flew out to singapore so we could be together lauren then maybe 18 months ago we quit our jobs to do this fulltime charlotte we thought if we dont throw everything in now well always regret it were your resignation letters like im off to be a star lauren well holly and i were in the theatre so we just didnt renew our contracts whereas charlotte was actually a deputy head teacher charlotte the head was one of my closest friends and a lot of the kids had already seen us at gigs – so everyone knew it was gonna happen it was just a matter of time remember monday hollyanne hull the trio have been performing together since they met at sixth form college in farnborough are you prepared for how overwhelming eurovision week is lauren yeah but were quite good at immersing ourselves in what were doing charlotte even if there wasnt a bubble around us the three of us make a bubble eurovision is all we talk about even if were not together lauren and then im sure from the 18th of may onwards well have a fair amount of downtime hollyanne the comedown is going to be rough what are your hopes for the result hollyanne we do have a preference and i think the closer we get to it the more hungry we are for a good result a placement in the single digits would be nice steve mcmahon the band received a warm reception at the eurovision preparty in madrid,,,,,,,,Fresh

creating a powerpoint presentation that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex that was intended to be used in schools the slides included the sentence it is never ok to start choking someone without asking them first bridgend council said it was part of a draft version never shown to children and the slides were dropped following feedback from professionals but experts and politician natasha asghar have asked why the welsh authority deemed appropriate to include an illegal act in any draft of the presentation bridgend council commissioned the school resource from their inhouse domestic abuse service called assia and a presentation was leaked last year prime minister sir keir starmer and wales first minister eluned morgan were among those sent an open letter raising concerns of parents and professionals that deliver sex education lessons claire waxman the victims commissioner for london also told the times that the material was deeply concerning former conservative mep

dangerous and illegal and added the resources bridgend council gave schools make this clear bridgend council commissioned the school resource but said the slide was removed at a draft stage and never shown to children bridgend council have since issued a clarification statement that said the slides were part of inaccurate or outofdate information that was either updated or removed but it raised further questions as to why the material and messaging existed in the first place so bbc wales asked them for more information the authority said the slide was part of an active presentation the idea was that the presenter would use the slide to stimulate debate before advising participants that nonfatal strangulation is actually a dangerous illegal crime which carries significant penalties said bridgend councils statement they said that part of the presentation was dropped following feedback from professionals consulted during the drafting process sources including michael conroy who trains professionals like teachers to deliver sex education lessons have told the bbc that they understand the presentation was offered to schools and youth settings to show michael conroy michael conroy works with schools in wales and england and said theres a vulnerability for schools because theyre expected to cover topics none of their staff are trained to deliver however the council denied this and said it was only sent as a work in progress with a small group of professionals for their insight and views it was presented as this is what we will teach to children there was intention there said mr conroy a former personal social and health education coordinator in schools who did not receive the presentation from the council directly when mr conroy first saw the slide in question he said it was terrifying and there was not any additional information about safety on other slides the idea that someone is saying its ok to strangle a person if you get a yes is atrocious added mr conroy of men at work its the opposite of safeguarding its a terrible breach of trust welsh parliament member asghar said she had been contacted by concerned parents and called for bridgend council to release the material getty images welsh senedd member natasha asghar says it is important young people are equipped with the right information to make good choices im requesting both versions of this

not negate from that fact those responsible for the content originally deemed it appropriate this is where i have my concerns asghar said she had written to the council leader but was without a reply

confirmed alexanders release in a post on truth social calling it monumental news and a step taken in good faith born in tel aviv but raised in new jersey 21yearold alexander was serving in an elite

hostages egypt and qatar also released a joint statement saying that hamas agreeing to free alexander was an encouraging step toward a return to the negotiating table in its statement hamas said the release was part of efforts to achieve a ceasefire and allow food medicine and other supplies into gaza which has been under a complete blockade by israel for 70 days the group said it wanted to reach a final agreement to end the war the israeli prime ministers office said in an earlier statement that it had been informed by the us of the hamas intention to release alexander as a gesture towards the americans and that the move was expected to lead to negotiations on further hostages israels policy was that negotiations would be conducted under fire based on the commitment to achieve all of the objectives of the war it added hamas has in the past said it will only agree to a deal that includes the end of the war something that has been repeatedly rejected by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the talks between hamas and the us are taking place amid multiple reports suggesting growing frustration in the trump administration with netanyahus position the prime minister is also under pressure at home with many accusing him of prolonging the war for political purposes president donald trump arrives in the middle east on tuesday and israel has vowed to expand its military offensive against hamas if no deal is reached by the end of his visit israeli officials have said the plans for their expanded offensive include seizing all of the territory indefinitely forcibly displacing palestinians to the south and taking over aid distribution with private companies despite opposition from the un and its humanitarian partners who say they will not cooperate because it appears to weaponise aid reuters gaza has been under a full israeli blockade for 70 days israel has already blocked the entry of all food medication and other humanitarian supplies into gaza for 70 days which aid agencies say amounts to a policy of starvation and could be a war crime and renewed its aerial bombardment and other military operations there in midmarch which have since killed 2720

A0927,2025-05-12,0,Do Israel’s attacks make a difference to Yemen’s Houthis?,Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/12/do-israels-attacks-make-a-difference-to-yemen-houthis?traffic_source=rss,the us and the houthis may have come to a ceasefire agreement but israel continues to trade attacks with the yemeni group amid ferocious israeli attacks on yemen ostensibly in response to houthi attacks on israel surprising news from the united states seemed to shake matters briefly us president donald trump said on tuesday that a ceasefire had been agreed between his country and the houthis claiming the houthis had bent the knee and this was a victory for the us he also praised the houthis for their bravery and resilience this meant the us would no longer be bombing yemen and the houthis would stop firing at ships in the red sea in support of the palestinians in gaza there was no mention of israel in trump’s announcement – a sign to many of a possible chill between trump and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the houthis for their part made it clear that the deal does not extend to israel and they would continue their attacks until israel allowed aid into gaza ending the starvation it is imposing on the people there israel left out israel has been launching attacks on yemen claiming it wants to deter the houthis who took control of sanaa in 2014 and already fought a yearslong war against the internationally recognised yemeni government advertisement on sunday israel’s arabiclanguage spokesman made a post with eerie echoes of israeli attacks on the trapped population of gaza issuing “warnings” to people in three yemeni ports in hodeidah governorate to flee the attack never came whether these erratic actions are a reaction to the announced us ceasefire remains to be seen but many analysts have spoken of a widening rift between netanyahu and trump netanyahu has reportedly expressed his frustration with trump’s middle east policy in private conversations he has been publicly against the us administration’s talks with iran claiming there is no diplomatic way to resolve differences with tehran yet iran and the us have continued their talks he went on to blame iran for the houthis’ attacks claiming israel’s attacks are a message to the “houthis’ sponsors” trump for his part has seemed unconcerned “it’s worth noting trump didn’t say anything about houthi attacks on israel which seem to be continuing amid this escalation” nicholas brumfield a yemen analyst told al jazeera “in this case it’s a us drawdown because the houthis haven’t been attacking international shipping” brumfield said “they’ve been attacking israel the us has been doing its thing and the houthis have been targeting us ships” after israeli attacks on monday and tuesday which killed at least three people and wounded 35 others and damaged hodeidah port and sanaa airport the houthis promised retaliation the attacks “will not go unanswered” the houthi political bureau said in a statement that kind of statement is typical of the houthis who have managed to weather more than a decade of attacks by forces with far superior military capabilities advertisement air strikes by the us and united kingdom on yemen in early 2024 were unable to stop the houthis’ attacks on red sea traffic years of air strikes by a saudiled coalition supporting yemen’s internationally recognised government taught the houthis to keep their military infrastructure agile analysts told al jazeera a senior us government official speaking on condition of anonymity told al jazeera that recent us attacks on the houthis have pushed leaders underground after the killing of some key military commanders however unlike under us president joe biden’s administration the attacks under trump have been indiscriminate and have led to more civilian deaths more than 250 people have been killed by us attacks on yemen since midmarch including at least 68 people at a centre housing detained african refugees and migrants in late april experts told al jazeera that despite the increased ferocity of those attacks the houthis have not been deterred “the houthis aren’t going to stop” brumfield said israel still striking the houthis have made their stance clear visàvis the agreement with the us and the continuation of attacks on israel which has also made clear that it plans to keep attacking “the stated aim is to deter the houthis or deplete their military capabilities to the point that the houthis cannot target israel any more but these are both very unrealistic goals” hannah porter an independent yemen analyst told al jazeera israel already considers that it has diminished the capabilities of two of its biggest foes hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza over the past 19 months advertisement but trying something like that on the houthis would be a vastly different challenge she said “israel has probably not gathered the amount of intel on the houthis that they have on hamas or hezbollah so tracking and targeting leaders will be harder” porter said “more importantly the geographic area is much larger in northern yemen meaning that there are far more potential targets” “the terrain is a factor too” she added “northern yemen is very mountainous with plenty of places to hide people and weapons” for now israel and the houthis seem intent on continuing their exchange of attacks and the first to suffer will be the people of yemen israel struck numerous targets in recent days in yemen including sanaa’s airport and the port in hodeidah which experts said is likely to exacerbate yemen’s dire humanitarian situation israel destroyed at least three civilian planes in the attacks yemen is already suffering one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises more than 182 million people require humanitarian assistance and protection services according to the united nations more than 171 million yemenis suffer acute food shortages and about five million are on the brink of famine while analysts said israel’s attacks on ports will not be a “knockout blow” they are among a matrix of factors that leave many yemenis in an increasingly precarious position “the humanitarian situation will just get worse” raiman alhamdani a yemen researcher with the international development company ark told al jazeera advertisement “destroying the two main ports of northern yemen where the majority of the population lives coupled with the fto “foreign terrorist organisation” designation with cuts to the aid system around the world and the deteriorating economy … is a recipe for unprecedented humanitarian disaster” “israel’s attacks are a continuation of its strategy it’s out of spite targets civil infrastructure and the policy of creating human suffering” alhamdani said both sides seem unwilling to stop however “i cannot see anything quite good coming out of this unless the war israel is waging on gaza comes to some form of truce” alhamdani said,,,,,,,,Fresh
A0928,2025-05-12,0,‘Who suffered the most?’: Fear and fatigue in Kashmir after ceasefire,Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/12/we-want-permanent-solution-fear-and-fatigue-in-kashmir-after-ceasefire?traffic_source=rss,the region which faced the brunt of the indiapakistan military escalation limps back to life but questions remain srinagar indianadministered kashmir — on saturday morning at fateh kadal a densely packed neighbourhood on the sloping embankment of the jhelum river in srinagar indianadministered kashmir’s largest city 62yearold hajira wrapped a cotton scarf with a brown paisley design around her shoulders with her face muscles tense and sweat beading across her upper lip she sat on the cement floor of a governmentrun grains store “can you make it quick” she called to the person manning the store hajira comes to the store every month to submit her biometric details as required by the government to secure the release of her monthly quota of subsidised grains which her family of four depends on but this time was different the past few days have been unprecedented for residents of indianadministered kashmir drones hovered overhead airports were shut down explosions rang out people were killed in crossborder fire and the region prepared for the possibility of an allout war “he made me stand in the queue” she said flinching from knee pain referring to the store operator “but there’s uncertainty around i just want my share of rice so i can quickly return a war is coming” advertisement then on saturday evening hajira breathed a sigh of relief united states president donald trump announced that he had succeeded in mediating a ceasefire between india and pakistan “i thank god for this” hajira said smiling sheepishly “perhaps he understood that i didn’t have the means to endure the financial hardship that a warlike situation would have caused” on sunday morning trump went a step further saying in a post on his truth social platform that he would try to work with india and pakistan to resolve their longstanding dispute over kashmir a region both countries partly control but claim in its entirety political analyst zafar choudhary based in the city of jammu in southern kashmir told al jazeera that new delhi would not be happy about trump’s statement india has long argued that pakistansponsored “terrorism” is the primary reason for tensions between the nucleararmed neighbours however “trump’s offer underlines the fact that kashmir remains central to indiapakistan confrontations” choudhary said and for kashmiris the hope stemming from the fragile pause in fighting between india and pakistan and trump’s offer to mediate talks on kashmir is tempered by scepticism borne from a decadeslong desperate wait for peace ‘never been more frightened’ hundreds of thousands of kashmiris stood in the direct line of fire between india and pakistan in recent days advertisement as the neighbouring nations launched missiles and drones at each other kashmiri communities near the line of control loc the de facto border with pakistan also witnessed crossborder shelling on a scale unseen in decades triggering an exodus of people towards safer locations the shadow of conflict has stalked their lives for nearly four decades since an armed rebellion first erupted against the indian government in the late 1980s then in 2019 the government scrapped kashmir’s semiautonomous status amid a huge security crackdown – thousands of people were imprisoned on april 22 a brutal attack by gunmen on tourists at pahalgam killed 26 civilians shattering the normalcy critics had accused india of projecting in the disputed region since then in addition to a diplomatic titfortat and missile exchanges with pakistan the indian government has intensified its crackdown on the armed groups active in kashmir it has demolished the homes of rebels accused of links to the pahalgam attack raided other homes across the region and detained approximately 2800 people 90 of whom have been booked under the public safety act a draconian preventive detention law the police also summoned many journalists and arrested at least one for “promoting secessionist ideology” by sunday while a sense of jubilation swept through the region over the ceasefire many people were still cautious doubtful even about whether the truce brokered by trump would hold just hours after both countries declared a cessation of hostilities loud explosions rang out in major urban centres across kashmir as a swarm of kamikaze drones from pakistan raced across the airspace advertisement many residents raced to the terraces of their apartments and homes to capture videos of the drones being brought down by india’s defence systems a trail of bright red dots arcing across the night sky before exploding midair as part of the emergency protocols the authorities turned off the electricity supply fearing that the debris from drones would fall on them residents ran for safety the surge of drones through the night skies also touched off sirens triggering a sense of dread “i don’t think i have ever been more frightened before” said hasnain shabir a 24yearold business graduate from srinagar “the streets have been robbed of all their life if the prelude to war looks like this i don’t know what war will look like” a fragile ceasefire hours after the ceasefire was announced on saturday india accused pakistan of violating it by shelling border regions residents across major towns in kashmir were on their toes once again after drones reappeared in the skies one of the worstaffected places in kashmir during these days is uri a picturesque town of pear orchards and walnut groves close to india’s contested border with pakistan the village is surrounded by majestic mountains through which the jhelum flows it is the final frontier on the indianadministered side before the hills pave the way to pakistanadministered kashmir advertisement parts of uri saw intense shelling forcing the residents to leave their homes and look for safety on may 8 officials told al jazeera that a woman nargis bashir was killed in her car as she and her family tried to flee the border region like thousands of others after flying shrapnel tore through the vehicle three of her family members were wounded muhammad naseer khan 60 a former serviceman was huddling in his room when pakistani artillery fire hit a nearby military post with metal shards blasting through the walls of his house “the blast has damaged one side of my home” khan said wearing a traditional blue shirt and a tweed coat “i don’t know if this place is even liveable” he said his bright blue eyes betraying a sense of fear despite the ceasefire his two daughters and many others in his family who had left for a relative’s house away from the disputed border are sceptical about returning “my children are refusing to return they have no guarantee that guns won’t roar again” he said suleman sheikh a 28yearold resident in uri recalled his childhood years when his grandfather would talk about the bofors artillery guns stationed inside a military garrison in the nearby village of mohra “he told us that the last time this gun had roared was in 1999 when india and pakistan clashed on the icy peaks of kargil it is a conventional belief here that if this gun roared again things are going to get too bad” he said that is what happened at 2am on may 8 as the bofors guns in mohra prepared to fire ammunition across the mountains into pakistan sheikh felt the ground shaking beneath him an hour and a half later a shell fired from the other side hit an indian paramilitary installation nearby making a long hissing noise before striking with a thud advertisement hours after sheikh spoke to al jazeera another shell landed on his home the rooms and the portico of his house collapsed according to a video he shared with al jazeera later he had refused to leave his home despite his family’s pleas to join them “i was here to protect our livestock” sheikh said “i didn’t want to leave them alone” unlike the rest of the kashmir valley where apple cultivation brings millions of dollars in income for the region uri is relatively poor villagers mostly work odd jobs for the indian army which maintains large garrisons there or farm walnuts and pears livestock rearing has turned into a popular vocation for many in the town “we have the firsthand experience of what war feels like it is good that the ceasefire has taken place but i don’t know if it will hold or not” sheikh said his face downcast “i pray that it does” ‘how long must this continue’ back in srinagar residents are slowly returning to the rhythm of their daily lives schools and colleges remain closed and people are avoiding unnecessary travel the scenes of racing drone fleets in the skies and the accompanying blasts are seared into public memory “only in the evening will we come to know whether this ceasefire has held on” said muskaan wani a student of medicine at government medical college srinagar on sunday it did overnight but the tension over whether it will last remains advertisement political experts attribute the general scepticism about the ceasefire to the unresolved political issues in the region – a point that was echoed in trump’s statement on sunday in which he referred to a possible “solution concerning kashmir” “the problem to begin with is the political alienation of kashmiris” said noor ahmad baba a former professor and head of the political science department at the university of kashmir “people in kashmir feel humiliated for what has happened to them in the last few years and there haven’t been any significant efforts to win them over when there’s humiliation there is suspicion” others in indianadministered kashmir expressed their anger at both countries for ruining their lives “i doubt that our feelings as kashmiris even matter” said furqan a software engineer in srinagar who gave his first name only “two nuclear powers fought caused damage and casualties at the borders gave their respective nations a spectacle to watch their goals were achieved and then they stopped the war “but the question is who suffered the most it’s us for the world we are nothing but collateral damage” furqan said his friends were sceptical about the ceasefire when the two countries resumed shelling on the evening of may 10 “we all already were like ‘it is not gonna last” he said “and then we heard the explosions again” muneeb mehraj a 26yearold resident of srinagar who studies management in the northern indian state of punjab echoed furqan advertisement “for others the war may be over a ceasefire has been declared but once again it’s kashmiris who have paid the price – lives lost homes destroyed peace shattered” he said “how long must this cycle continue” “we are exhausted” mehraj continued “we don’t want another temporary pause we want a lasting permanent solution”,,,,,,,,Fresh

A0942,2025-05-12,0,3 Things I'll Be Watching in Walmart's Upcoming Earnings Report (and 2 I'll Ignore),Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-things-ill-watching-walmarts-081200614.html,the first metric is the growth of walmarts retail media business you know it better as advertising rather there are three other metrics i believe mean much more to longterm investors none of these numbers is a key concern of mine right now however theyll only be a snapshot of how the worlds biggest retailer has been affected by unexpectedly sudden and steep import tariffs that should hopefully soon be under control indeed as walmart cfo john david rainey conceded in april operating income has been harder to predict and weve widened our internal range of profit scenarios thanks to tariff uncertainty if the company isnt quite sure where the bottom line is headed neither investors nor analysts will want to count on any particular figure sales arent etched in stone either for the threemonth stretch ending in april analysts expect walmart to report earnings of 058 per share on sales of 1645 billion thats a 2 improvement on the yearago revenue figure of 1615 billion but rising costs will likely drag the bottom line down from a pershare comp of 060 us samestore sales growth also likely slowed a bit from the fourth quarters pace of 49 reflecting the broader effect of lingering inflation and fresh economic uncertainty on consumer spending rather im watching three other pieces of information that will provide a much better picture of how the companys doing in this tricky environment these three data nuggets are also better barometers of walmarts longerterm health than the moretouted quarterly numbers are im not as interested in the mostwatched quarterly numbers this time around im sure theyll be pretty good but not great and more or less in line with estimates we may be well into earnings season but we havent heard from every noteworthy name just yet megaretailer walmart nyse wmt is slated to report its fiscal firstquarter numbers on thursday morning offering a glimpse into consumers current psyches and buying power don’t read too much into the stock’s initial response to the retailer’s upcoming q1 earnings report no matter which direction it moves walmart’s management recently said that tariffs and their ensuing uncertainty make it difficult to maintain profit margins or predict profitability story continues if youve ever shopped at walmartcom you might have noticed advertisements on each page you navigate these arent just efforts from walmart to induce a purchase these ad placements are being paid for by the brands that walmart sells we wont hear a specific number just a percentage change probably somewhere in the mid20percent range plus a specific percentagechange figure for its us onlineshopping business for perspective walmart did 34 billion worth of worldwide advertising business last year up 28 year over year thats only a drop in the bucket compared to walmarts total revenue but for a company that only produced 271 billion in operating income and 155 billion in net income for the entirety of last year this highmargin advertising business is actually a major contributor to the bottom line the second issue is last quarters cost of goods sold and operating costs like administrative expenses and selling payroll most of last fiscal quarters sales came from goods that would have been purchased prior to any tariffinduced price increases we could have seen some hint of these price hikes by april though walmarts aiming to abate as much of this effect as it can it remains to be seen how much it can or even if its starting to become a problem yet the benchmark here is somewhere in the ballpark of the prior quarters gross margin rate of 24 as for selling and administrative costs walmarts been adding automation to its supply chain for the past couple of years with the ultimate goal of cutting its onlineorderfulfillment costs by 30 by the end of this year instore payroll and administrative costs are likely to remain relatively static so itll be interesting to see how much net benefit this added efficiency will actually provide the companys fourthquarter operating expenses were a hair over 20 of sales roughly in line with the fullyear number it matters because retailers profit margins are always under pressure but particularly so right now against a backdrop of higher import tariffs at the very least well want to see spending growth not exceed revenue growth before any tariffs take full hold finally ill specifically want to know how well walmarts ecommerce arm is growing you wont get a specific number here either just a comparison expressed as a percentage for perspective however the prior quarters online sales improved 16 overall and 20 within the united states where most of its online sales are made thats a measurable slowdown from the third quarters respective growth paces as well as last years first and secondquarter online sales growth rate although the bulk of walmarts business is still done instore the companys now doing over 100 billion worth of annual online business thats about 15 of last years total top line of 681 billion ecommerce is the companys biggest growth engine right now however so if its slowing down it could take a sizable toll on walmarts overall forward progress think biggerpicture theres no assurance that other investors will be keying in on this data from thursdays report indeed its likely they wont the market will probably initially push walmart stock higher or lower based on its wellwatched revenue and earnings data as it typically does just dont read too much into any such move its apt to only be a shortterm response to numbers that are being temporarily skewed and not necessarily for the worse by tariffprompted turbulence rbc capital markets says walmart is better equipped than its competitors to handle whatever tariffrelated challenges await thanks to its sheer scale and operational adaptability that just means any trouble that might become apparent on thursday is also apt to be unwound pretty quickly any initial postearnings move from this stock should ultimately give way to the biggerpicture undertow illustrated by the aforementioned metrics they paint a clearer picture of how the worlds biggest retailer is actually navigating the current economic environment if youre looking to make a preearnings bet id lean more toward owning walmart stock than not most of any shortterm tariffrelated trouble is likely already priced in setting the stage for the operational and costcontrol resilience that rbc sees to be thrust into the spotlight if thats the wrong call its still only apt to be a shortterm setback

A0948,2025-05-12,0,Prediction: Nvidia Just Received Its First Wall Street Sell Rating -- and More Will Follow After May 28,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prediction-nvidia-just-received-first-075100834.html,nvidia just received its first wall street sell rating and after may 28 which is the date nvidia will unveil its fiscal 2026 firstquarter operating results i fully expect more analysts to follow suit given nvidias supercharged growth rate and the fact that no other direct competitor has come remotely close to matching its combination of compute speed and energy efficiency its no surprise that wall street analysts have rallied around the stock markets ai darling in late january i noted that the dozens of wall street analysts covering nvidia all had respective price targets that was higher than where shares then traded in just two fiscal years nvidias fiscal year ends in late january nvidias net sales skyrocketed from 27 billion to 1305 billion for context wall streets consensus calls for nearly 201 billion in fullyear sales for fiscal 2026 this year and 248 billion in fiscal 2027 almost overnight nvidias hopper h100 graphics processing unit gpu became the preferred brains powering enterprise aiaccelerated data centers this has been followed up by the nextgeneration blackwell gpu architecture which can further expedite compute needs and is more energy efficient than its predecessor while an estimated 157 trillion addressable market leaves room for dozens if not hundreds of winners no company has been a more direct beneficiary of the rise of ai than semiconductor colossus nvidia nasdaq nvda in its simplest form ai empowers software and systems with the capacity to reason and act on their own as well as affords the potential to learn new skillsets without the need for human oversight its a gamechanging technology with broad global application that the analysts at pwc believe can increase worldwide gross domestic product gdp 157 trillion by 2030 although president donald trumps tariff policy has dominated the discussion on wall street over the last six weeks its the evolution of artificial intelligence ai thats captivated investors for well over two years its only a matter of time before other wall street analysts take note that nvidias biggest competitive advantage is waning one wall street analyst has bucked popular sentiment by placing a sell rating and 100 price target on the kingpin of the ai revolution no company has benefited more directly from the rise of artificial intelligence ai than nvidia story continues one wall street analyst is bucking popular sentiment in late april seaport research partners senior analyst jay goldberg initiated coverage on nvidia with a 100 price target a wall street low and a sell rating though goldberg acknowledged that nvidia has done a lot right and its blackwell gpu is highly soughtafter he believed the bull case was fully priced in with numerous downside catalysts waiting in the wings for one goldberg believes itll be difficult for nvidia to surpass wall streets lofty consensus expectations given that its maxed out its order capacity for blackwell in fiscal 2026 even though worldleading chip fabrication company taiwan semiconductor manufacturing is rapidly expanding its chiponwaferonsubstrate cowos capacity cowos is essential for the packaging of highbandwidth memory needed in aiaccelerated data centers its still holding nvidia back from selling even more of its nextgen hardware goldberg also anticipates that businesses will take a hard look at their spending later this year and into calendar year 2026 while seaports senior analyst doesnt expect an ai bubble to form and burst he does believe that businesses are still in the process of feeling out realworld use cases for artificial intelligence goldberg suggests this will result in slower ai spendingorders in the quarters to come additionally and not surprisingly goldberg alluded to export restrictions to china as a frontandcenter headwind as a reminder the joe biden administration since october 2022 and trump administration placed stringent export restrictions on many highpowered ai chips and related equipment to china the worlds no 2 economy by gdp generates billions of dollars in quarterly sales for nvidia which could notably shrink if tariffrelated uncertainty persists and trade relations between the us and china sour but i believe this is just the tip of the iceberg and other wall street analysts will follow in goldbergs footsteps once nvidias lifts the proverbial hood after the closing bell on may 28 image source getty images more sell ratings are likely for wall streets ai darling similar to goldberg im happy to give nvidia credit where credit is due the companys hopper and blackwell chips will likely maintain their compute advantages and remain soughtafter hardware for ai data centers but nvidias nearly 29 trillion valuation suggests it has big shoes to fill and there are more headwinds upcoming than seaports senior analyst has listed arguably the top challenge for nvidia is the internal competition its contending with while most investors and analysts focus on direct competitors like advanced micro devices and huawei theyre completely missing that many of nvidias top customers by net sales are internally developing ai chips and solutions to use in their data centers despite most of these companies noting that this internally developed hardware will work sidebyside with nvidias gpus it doesnt change the fact that this will lead to cheaper and more readily available ai solutions that arent backlogged its a plainasday recipe for nvidia to miss out on future data center market share equally important nvidia is losing its biggest competitive advantage and no im not talking about the compute speed of hopper or blackwell rather im alluding to the benefits its reaped from aigpu scarcity though nvidia cant meet the overwhelming demand for its blackwell gpu architecture its not stopping amd from bringing lesscostly nextgeneration chips to market its also not slowing the aforementioned internal innovation of nvidias top clients as this hardware enters highcompute data centers it reduces the aigpu scarcity and immense pricing power that fueled nvidias gross margin one year ago in fiscal 2025 nvidia reported a scorchinghot generally accepted accounting principles gaap gross margin of 784 since then its gaap gross margin has declined every quarter and is expected to have fallen to an estimated 706 50 basis points for the fiscal first quarter which itll report on may 28 were witnessing nvidias leading advantage wane before our eyes lastly history would strongly suggest that artificial intelligence wont escape a bubblebursting event every nextbigthing technology or innovation for more than 30 years has endured a bubble early in its expansion phase with an overwhelming majority of businesses not optimizing their ai solutions or even generating a positive return on their ai investments it once again appears that investors have overestimated the early

changed with the artificial intelligence ai boom and the launch two years ago of its aipowered product simply called its artificial intelligence platform or aip this system uses ai throughout the process of aggregating a customers disparate data and helping that customer put it to work the results are often striking changing the game for that particular user aip is helping customers save time and money make better decisions and develop new strategies and systems palantir has been around for more than 20 years and in its earlier days it mainly was known for serving the government with its data gathering and analyses platforms the company over this time period built out its capabilities then launched an initial public offering five years ago though the stock initially took off it slumped and wallowed in the doldrums a few years later this redhot player is palantir technologies nasdaq pltr and its recent news shows us why investors are so excited about the stock yet again palantir reported quarterly doubledigit revenue growth solid profitability and boosted guidance for the full year but before we get to that lets look at palantirs path so far and how it rushed from investors radar screens into their portfolios yet against this backdrop of uncertainty one tech company in particular stands out this software player has seen its shares soar 1400 over the past three years resulting in a valuation that many analysts have said isnt sustainable for months theyve predicted the stock was set to pull back but so far any declines havent lasted in fact this supercharged growth stock has climbed 55 so far this year lets meet the monster stock that continues to crush the market many of todays tech stocks including the magnificent seven that led last years stock market gains have suffered in recent times even the most established of tech players such as nvidia or apple for example have seen their shares stumble why investors have worried that president donald trumps import tariff plan would hurt growth higher prices could result in lower spending by us consumers and companies its recent earnings report showed the company has what it takes to keep generating growth over the long term this stock has soared 1400 over the past three years and has climbed in the double digits since the start of this year story continues and to spur growth of this new system palantir launched bootcamps to offer customers an opportunity to test aip and see how it could work for them this has proven to be a fantastic strategy and thanks to this the quality of aip and the fact that the ai boom is going strong palantirs commercial revenue took off so now palantir continues to see growth from its government customers and commercial revenue is contributing significantly too all of this unfolding quarter after quarter has stirred up investor excitement and helped the stock to skyrocket deals worth at least 1 million in the most recent quarter the first quarter of its fiscalyear 2025 palantir delivered a fresh dose of good news the us government and commercial businesses each reported a doubledigit increase in revenue deal value also is climbing with palantir saying it closed 139 deals in the period that were worth at least 1 million thats up from 104 deals of that value just two quarters ago importantly palantir is balancing this growth with profitability and this is reflected in its rule of 40 score of 83 at 40 a software company is viewed as having a good growthprofit balance so clearly palantir is excelling in this area finally palantir finished off the report by lifting its total revenue us commercial revenue adjusted income from operations and adjusted free cash flow guidance levels for the full year now lets consider stock price this has been the sticking point for potential investors though palantirs outlook is incredibly bright the stock is trading at a very high valuation 200x forward earnings estimates and analysts continue to predict a decline is near wall streets average price target calls for the stock to fall about 20 in the coming 12 months what does this mean for you as an investor if youre a value investor you probably wont want to pick up palantir shares right now as theyre not the right fit for a value strategy but if youre a growth investor and you aim to hold your investment for a number of years you still may benefit from a palantir buy today even at todays price though the stock could indeed stumble and go through a period of stagnation this supercharged growth company has what it takes to power its share

Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/12/joel-cauchi-schizophrenia-nurse-bondi-junction-stabbings-inquest-ntwnfb,a nurse at the queensland medical practice where joel cauchi was treated for schizophrenia remembers him as a “compliant” and “diligent” patient telling an inquest she vomited when she learned he had fatally stabbed six people at a sydney shopping centre cauchi 40 killed ashlee good 38 jade young 47 yixuan cheng 27 pikria darchia 55 dawn singleton 25 and faraz tahir 30 and injured 10 others at westfield bondi junction on 13 april last year before he was shot and killed by police inspector amy scott cauchi was treated at a private queensland clinic from 2012 after being discharged from the public health system after 11 years in its care known only as rn2 the mental health nurse said she saw cauchi on a monthly basis from 2015 to 2017 when she monitored his psychotropic medication for his schizophrenia and ocd she learned of the stabbings when she was sent a text stating the bondi junction attacker was from toowoomba “i looked it up and then i vomited when i saw it was him” she told the court “it’s odd it’s incongruent with what i know of joel it really doesn’t make any sense “i was incredibly shocked i wouldn’t have ever thought that was something that he would have done i had a very visceral response to that” in the third week of the fiveweek inquest into the seven deaths the lidcombe coroner’s court was exploring why cauchi was weaned off psychotropic medication and how he dropped out of the mental health system from 2020 rn2 said cauchi was “someone who was very compliant … he was never even late for appointments and there was no having to chase him up he was very compliant “i actually thought he was relatively insightful and he was also concerned about his illness in that he was quite diligent in monitoring for signs of relapse he didn’t want to get unwell and he was very conscientious with regard to his mental health i think that was evidenced by his punctuality and engagement with our service” the new south wales coroner teresa o’sullivan was told “he had anxiety around it” rn2 said adding that cauchi “wanted to get the support and do the right thing” cauchi had been prescribed clopine clozapine indicating that he had treatmentresistant schizophrenia she said “that obviously meant that his condition was quite severe however because he was so compliant he wasn’t difficult to manage and he was stable as well” cauchi’s treatment plan was to reduce the clopine to the most effective level relative to the side effects – such as cognitive “fuzziness” and sedation – as opposed to ceasing the medication the court heard cauchi’s medical notes from early 2016 showed he was “easier and more relaxed” on a lower dose of clopine the nurse said she saw an improvement in his energy levels and “more quality of life” and did not have any concerns about his medication being lowered the nurse left the practice and returned in 2019 by which time cauchi had stopped taking clopine altogether she said she had never heard of a patient ending clopine without moving to alternative drugs on 14 february 2020 the nurse spoke with cauchi’s mother after she called the practice expressing her concern about his inability to keep his unit tidy the inquest heard on monday he was preparing to move to brisbane at the time when she broached the subject with him he would become irritable notes from that call were read to the court “he can’t seem to look after himself” the court heard with dishes in his sink and “mess everywhere” he was isolated irritable and occasionally swearing the practice was told “that was out of character” the nurse said adding that the concerns may have been due to cauchi’s developmental delay because of his illness – or early warning signs of relapse cauchi’s transfer of care ‘less than ideal’ shortly afterwards cauchi moved to brisbane and was discharged from the practice into the care of his gp in the toowoomba area because he did not have a gp in brisbane the court heard rn2 recalled a conversation between practice staff suggesting cauchi’s move from the area and its support network was “less than ideal” but that the team did not have specific concerns she said schizophrenia patients – who were often highly disorganised – having to selfmanage their transfer to a new psychiatrist via a gp was “not an ideal system” under crossexamination by sue chrysanthou sc the barrister for the families of young singleton and good rn2 said the concerns of cauchi’s mother “needed to be taken seriously” given he could have been falsely reporting his symptoms to the nurse and his psychiatrist the nurse agreed that it was inappropriate to go from monthly monitoring to zero care when asked whether the practice should have followed up with cauchi after march 2020 to check he had a new psychiatrist she replied “ideally “the best system would be to ensure there was continuity of care” she said skip past newsletter promotion sign up to breaking news australia free newsletter get the most important news as it breaks enter your email address sign up privacy notice newsletters

shown cauchi’s discharge letter from the private practice to his gp in march 2020 there was no recommendation for monthly monitoring by his treating psychiatrist chrysanthou asked rn2 if cauchi showed signs of violence hallucination hearing voices or discussed having a knife collection when on medication he did not the nurse replied the nurse said cauchi would have had to have been deemed at risk of harm to himself or others to be detained under the mental health act and forced to take antipsychotic medication ‘i want a totally porn free internet on my devices’ a year earlier cauchi’s mental health had rung alarm bells with his mother a second mental health nurse – known only as rn3 – who took over cauchi’s medication monitoring at the private practice in 2018 agreed that cauchi was in good health in the months after he ceased taking clopine notes from the practice shown to the court stated that in october 2018 cauchi was “excelling in function doing more than ever gym looking for a unit seeing employment agency for work social activities etc mum is happy with his progress” in september 2019 the notes showed that cauchi was still “doing well” and finishing a tesol certification but was sleeping poorly on 17 october 2019 cauchi’s mother began to express concerns about a possible relapse the notes state that other than fatigue and less sleep cauchi showed no early warning signs of a relapse they discussed cauchi joining a peer support program to help him transition from home to independent living cauchi’s appointments were moved from monthly to weekly contact by the next month cauchi’s mother was raising significant concerns with the practice about a possible relapse his mother said he was writing “a lot of notes at home” some suggesting he was under satanic control he had a desire for porn and said that she had observed a “funny walk” and a “change in his gait” he wore many layers of clothes to prevent himself from getting sick in an email from cauchi to the practice dated 12 november 2019 cauchi acknowledged he wanted to limit his porn exposure “can we please cover some ideas for a porn free phone … i want a totally porn free internet on my devices” he requested in an email from cauchi’s mother to the practice on 20 november 2019 she wrote “i have a feeling he is now hearing voices etc he is very distracted forgetful and the ocd is getting out of hand with him going through half a cake of soap in one shower … i would hate to see him have to go back into hospital after 20 years of being stable when on medication … he quite possibly won’t let on what is going on in his head but i think you need to know how he is” rn3 said she took cauchi’s mother’s concerns seriously but that at that time she “did not see any obvious signs of psychosis” rn3 said she encouraged cauchi to restart antipsychotic medication especially if there were early warning signs of relapse but the court heard cauchi’s father’s mental health history may have affected cauchi’s approach to treatment the practice notes show that cauchi’s father became adamant that he did not want his son to go on medication “as it will kill him” he said he had been “traumatised by demons when awake and hears voices” in late 2019 cauchi saw a sex worker after which he took a month’s worth of hiv medication after becoming concerned about exposure to stis the court heard that after cauchi moved to brisbane in march 2020 there was effectively no followup because he had moved from the toowoomba area he was no longer eligible for medicare appointments over skype “i was surprised that he was discharged” rn3 said recalling the day after the attack rn3 said that rn2 called her to share the news of cauchi’s involvement “i was quite shocked i had to … sit down” she said emotionally “my thoughts went to all the people who knew joel the joel we knew was not the person who did what happened on 13 april … we were all very shocked” she said cauchi “continually presented

A0975,2025-05-12,0,Trump says planned gift of luxury plane from Qatar is a very ‘transparent’ deal,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/trump-accept-luxury-plane-gift-qatar,donald trump has indicated he is ready to accept a luxury plane being offered to the us president as a gift from qatar’s royal family almost immediately igniting accusations of bribery and corruption as well as commensurate criticism a statement from qatar on sunday acknowledged it had held discussions with the us about “the possible transfer” of a plane to be used temporarily by trump as his presidential aircraft usurping air force one the emirate’s statement denied a final decision over the transfer had been made – or that it was a gift late on sunday however trump himself appeared to confirm the plan in a post on his truth social platform “so the fact that the defense department is getting a gift free of charge of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old air force one temporarily in a very public and transparent transaction so bothers the crooked democrats that they insist we pay top dollar for the plane” he wrote earlier on sunday citing multiple sources familiar with the matter abc reported that the trump administration was girding itself to accept a luxury boeing 7478 a jumbo jet from the qatari royals that was estimated to be worth about 400m and which has been described as a “flying palace” trump would then use the 13yearold plane as the new air force one until shortly before the conclusion of his second oval office stint at which point it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation no later than 1 january 2029 the luxury gift from qatar was expected to be announced next week during trump’s threeday tour of the middle east that includes saudi arabia the united arab emirates and qatar abc reported yet a qatari spokesperson said it was “inaccurate” to say that the jet would be gifted “during the upcoming visit of president trump” trump toured the opulent plane in february while it was parked at the palm beach international airport abc added assuming trump accepts the plane as planned the jumbo jet would first be transferred to the us air force so the military branch could configure the aircraft to meet the specifications required for presidential travel abc’s sources told the network the network added that any costs affiliated with its transfer would be paid for by the us air force which receives a significant portion of the revenue generated by federal taxpayers according to abc’s sources trump’s attorney general pam bondi and his top white house lawyer david warrington have preemptively concluded that it is “legally permissible” for trump to accept the luxury gift and then transfer it over to his presidential library both reportedly arrived at that conclusion after lawyers for the white house counsel’s office as well as the justice department said the gifted plane was not conditioned on any official act and therefore was not bribery those lawyers drafted an analysis for defense secretary pete hegseth which reiterated that nothing about the plane violated federal laws prohibiting us government officials accepting gifts from foreign states or their royals in fact abc’s sources said bondi’s reading of the situation was that the plane was being given to the us air force and then trump’s presidential library foundation rather than her boss himself nevertheless reports of the highly unusual – if not unprecedented – gift that trump’s subordinates had afforded their blessing for him to receive triggered a wave of criticisms towards the president the democratic senator chuck schumer quickly mocked trump’s political slogan of “america first” “nothing says ‘america first’ like air force one brought to you by qatar” the us senate minority leader from new york said in a statement “it’s not just bribery – it’s premium foreign influence with extra legroom” on x jamie raskin a democratic congressman of maryland said “trump must seek congress’ consent to take this 300m from qatar the constitution is perfectly clear no present of any kind whatever’ from a foreign state without congressional permission a gift you use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift and a grift” democratic pollster matt mcdermott echoed similar sentiments saying “literally speechless… “a foreign regime gifting a jet to a former president it’s bribery in broad daylight” mcdermott remarked that the trump organization run by the president’s children only days earlier had announced a new 55bn golf course in qatar “today qatar ‘gifts’ trump a luxury jet surely just a coincidence” mcdermott said meanwhile juliette kayyem a harvard university international security professor said “the surveillance and security aspects are also as disturbing as the grift” the cnn security analyst added “qatar will surely offer a plane that satisfies their needs as well” jonathan reiner a cnn medical analyst took to x and said “air force one is a checks notes air force plane a military aircraft it’s not intended to be a palace because the us doesn’t have a king” similarly new york times reporter maggie haberman a prolific trump scoopster wrote that the plane in question was “likely the most expensive gift from a foreign government in us history and will likely raise questions from legal experts” she added “if trump continued using it out of office it would give him access to a much more modern plane than trump force one” which is a private boeing 757 built in 1991 that belongs to the organization run by his sons,,,,,,,,Fresh

migration will fall significantly by end of this parliament starmer is now taking questions q are you promising net migration will fall every year starmer says he wants to get net migration down significantly but he does not commit to net migration falling every year i promise that net migration will fall significantly and i do want to get it down by the end of this parliament significantly share updated at 0959 cest 8m ago 1053 cest key points from starmers press conference on immigration keir starmer did not go into detail during his speech and qa in downing street this morning the home office has not published the immigration white paper yet although it has extensively trailed most or all of the key announcements and this morning it felt as if starmer’s main concern was to set the political framework rather than to explain the policy detail here are the main points he made starmer promised to cut net migration significantly by the end of this parliament see 843am he used the word “promise” several times including in his opening statement when he said now make no mistake this plan means migration will fall that’s a promise but he declined an invitation to promise that net migration would fall every year see 843am asked if it would fall every year he replied i’m promising it net migration will fall significantly and i do want to get it down by the end of this parliament significantly that is what this plan is intended to achieve he said that if the white paper measures failed to bring down net migration significantly “further measures” would be introduced in his opening statement he said i want to be very clear on this if we do need to take further steps if we do need to do more to release pressure on housing and our public services then mark my words we will he repeated this point during the qa – but without saying that those further measures might be he rejected claims that curbing immigration would be bad for growth generally economists believe that immigration boosts growth and this assumption has historically influenced the treasury’s approach to policy making but when asked about this starmer argued that the experience of the last few years showed that immigration doesn’t always help growth he said the theory that higher migration numbers necessarily lead to higher growth has been tested in the last four years we’ve had the highest net migration when the last government lost control to nearly on million and stagnant growth and so that link doesn’t hold on that evidence he also stressed that the white paper addressed skills and training “one of the reasons that we’ve had stagnant growth in my view for years is because we’ve underinvested chronically in skills and growth” he said he rejected suggestions that labour mps might be “squeamish” about the government taking a tough line on immigration asked about this he said on squeamishness i actually think that the labour party has as core values the idea that immigration should be controlled that it should be selective we should be choosing who we want higher skills the high talent routes into our country and it must be fair he said britain risked becoming “an island of strangers” without fair immigration controls in his opening statement he said nations depend on rules fair rules sometimes they’re written down often they’re not but either way they give shape to our values guide us towards our rights of course but also our responsibilities the obligations we owe to each other now in a diverse nation like ours and i celebrate that these rules become even more important without them we risk becoming an island of strangers not a nation that walks forward together he said he did not think it was “sensible” to put a cap on annual net migration numbers because previous attempts to do so had not worked he said i don’t think it’s sensible to put a hard edged cap on it that has been done in one form or another for the best part of 10 years by different prime ministers the only thing that links those prime ministers and the various caps or quotas or limits they put in place is – every single one of them failed and therefore going down the failed route is not a sensible way for me as with everything that i do serious pragmatic looking at the things that will actually make a material difference he said that with the white paper labour is implementing the ‘take back control’ approach to immigration promised but not delivered by brexiter tories see 836am he dismissed claims that the white paper is just a response to reform’s electoral success see

this because it is right because it is fair and because it is what i believe in share 1h ago 0936 cest starmer says his policies will deliver take back control of migration promised but not delivered by tory brexiters keir starmer is speaking now he says this strategy is crucial to his plan for change he is framing this in brexit terms he says the government is finally taking back control of our borders and closing the book “on a squalid chapter for our politics” he goes on take back control – everyone knows that slogan and everyone knows what it meant on immigration or at least that’s what people thought because what followed from the previous government starting with the people who used that slogan was the complete opposite between 2019 and 2023 even as they were going round our country telling people with a straight face that they would get immigration down net migration quadrupled until in 2023 it reached nearly 1 million that’s about the population of birmingham our second largest city that’s not control it’s chaos and look they must answer for themselves but i don’t think that you can do something like that by accident it was a choice a choice made even as they told you told the country they were doing the opposite – a onenation experiment in open borders conducted on a country that voted for control well no more today this labour government is shutting down the lab the experiment is over we will deliver what you’ve asked for time and again and we will take back control of our borders share updated at 1003 cest 2h ago 0926 cest the conservatives have rejected suggestions that keir starmer is being tough on immigration in a statement released overnight in response to the briefing about the white paper plans chris philp the shadow home secretary said keir starmer pretends to be tough but just weeks ago his mps voted against our 10year residency and economic contribution test for indefinite leave to remain now he says that immigrants who make no contribution should still be allowed to stay he is trying to take steal credit for recent substantial reductions in visa numbers that resulted from conservative reforms in april 2024 starmer also suspended the conservative plan for a £38000 salary threshold for family visas will he now bring that back today conservatives are forcing a vote on a binding migration cap and removing the human rights act from immigration matters but starmer and labour will vote it down starmer is the same man who wrote letters protesting against deporting dangerous foreign criminals and has overseen the worst ever start to a year for illegal immigrants crossing the channel the idea that starmer is tough on immigration is a joke philp is referring to a tory amendment to the border security asylum and immigration bill which is going through its remaining stages in the commons this evening share 2h ago 0919 cest care sector expresses alarm about plan to end international recruitment of care workers care providers are worried about the proposals to end the international recruitment of care workers in a statement issued yesterday jane townson ceo of the homecare association which represents homecare providers said international recruitment is a lifeline for the homecare sector enabling us to provide vital support to older and disabled people in their own homes care providers are already struggling to recruit within the uk we are deeply concerned the government has not properly considered what will happen to the millions of people who depend on care at home to live safely and independently and this morning amy clark commercial director of a care home firm in cornwall told the today programme that she did not think it was realistic for the government to expect care homes to recruit all their staff domestically she said the big problem that we would have is if we weren’t able to recruit any overseas staff because recruiting locally is very very difficult we try all the time to recruit locally we put our wages up we still don’t get applicants we’ve always paid higher than minimum wage but that is becoming increasingly difficult especially with the national insurance costs and also the national minimum wage increase and the pitiful uplift from the local authorities in relation to the social care funding share 2h ago 0856 cest it is worth stressing that today’s white paper is about legal immigration polling suggests that the public are worried about high levels of legal immigration but the political debate about immigration is largely driven by concern about illegal or irregular immigration – people arriving in small boats and being housed particularly in hotels if they are claiming asylum irregular immigration accounts for only a small proportion overall immigration according to office for national statistics figures 12 million came to live in the year ending june 2024 during that period 39000 people arrived on small boats most of them tried to claim

A0978,2025-05-12,0,"UK’s F-35 exports more important than stopping genocide, lawyers to argue",The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/12/uks-f-35-exports-more-important-than-stopping-genocide-lawyers-to-argue,preserving the british role in the f35 jet fighter programme takes precedence over the need to comply with uk laws on arms export controls or any uk obligation to prevent a genocide in israel uk government lawyers will argue in court this week the longawaited high court case will test whether ministers have broken the law by continuing to supply parts for the f35 programme that may be used by israel to attack palestinians in gaza the fourday case starts on tuesday and has taken nearly a year to come to court it has been brought by palestinian human rights group alhaq but is supported by a raft of british human rights groups including amnesty human rights watch oxfam and the global legal action network glan the court action has already had impact in september last year the uk suspended some arms export licences 90 minutes before it was due to appear in court to defend the continued arms export licences to israel in making the announcement in september suspending 30 arms export licences ministers gave a carve out for the supply of uk components to the global pool of f35 jets saying such disruption to the entire f35 programme would be a threat to nato’s peace and security in papers to the court the uk has acknowledged that its supply of f35 components for potential use in israel is in breach of its own arms export control laws the laws state that arms export licences must not be granted “if there is a clear risk those items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law by israel” the uk government’s lawyers say the maintenance of the global f35 supply chain is of paramount importance and parts are not being supplied directly to israel britain supplies 15 of the value of the f35 jet including ejector seats rear fuselage active interceptor systems targeting lasers and weapon release cables mainly through british aerospace the uk is the second largest supplier of spare parts for the jet after the us the uk insists it is not possible to set conditions on the use of these components such as requiring lockheed martin to temporarily ban sales of f35s to israel jennine walker a barrister representing alhaq said it was absurd for the government to argue peace and security is a good reason for the government to depart from its own arms export policies she said “of course it is possible for the government to stop british made parts for f35s being supplied to israel without the whole global programme being affected without any significant implications for international peace and security what really undermines international peace and security is these flagrant violations of the law” charlotte andrewsbriscoe a glan lawyer representing alhaq underlined the importance of the f35s to the israeli war effort describing their impact as “catastrophic and continuing” she said israeli pilots say they are working around the clock and nonstop having undertaken 15000 flight hours and 8000 missions since 7 october when thousands of hamasled gunmen attacked israeli communities around the gaza strip killing 1200 people and abducting 251 hostages in response the israeli campaign has killed more than 52000 people and reduced much of the territory to ruins “these war planes cause deaths and lifechanging injuries they also support ground troops that are intentionally starving an already decimated population” f35s she said played a critical role for instance on 18 march when israel broke the ceasefire with a wave of airstrikes that killed more than 400 according to the health ministry in gaza the dead included 183 children and 94 women palestinian officials said she also warned that the way the government had chosen to mount its legal case risked undermining the relevance of international law she said “the government has concluded the geneva conventions have no domestic application unless and until an international court has ruled conclusively on the commission of genocide which the government admit is likely to be years from now if the court accepts these arguments it would completely gut the meaning of the duty to prevent genocide under international law” skip past newsletter promotion sign up to first edition free daily

take all reasonable steps at its disposal to prevent a genocide adding that at the point britain restricted arms exports licences on 2 september but maintained them for the f35s the government did not even consider the risk of genocide in september when permitting the continued supply of parts ministers already knew 41000 palestinians had been killed in gaza including 15000 children and 19 million people had been displaced the vast majority forcibly while 60 of the residential property had been destroyed in a submission revealed at a preliminary hearing the defence secretary john healey said suspension would affect the “whole f35 programme” and have a “profound impact on international peace and security” he added that it would “undermine us confidence in the uk and nato at a critical juncture in our collective history and set back relations” and could cause “adversaries” to “take advantage of any perceived weakness” parts of the minister’s evidence on behalf the defence ministry was provided in public but defence ministry officials have claimed any decision to restrict supply of f35 parts is a matter for the f35 executive steering board a body that only acts by consensus it

group of 49 white south africans departed their homeland on sunday for the united states on a private charter plane having been offered refugee status by the trump administration under a new program announced in february the group which included families and small children was due to arrive at dulles international airport outside washington dc on monday morning local time according to collen msibi a spokesperson for south africa’s transport ministry they are the first afrikaners – a white minority group in south africa – to be relocated after donald trump issued an executive order in february accusing south africa’s blackled government of racial discrimination against them and announcing a program to offer them relocation to the us the south african government said it is “completely false” that afrikaners are being persecuted the trump administration has fasttracked their applications while pausing other refugee programs halting arrivals from afghanistan iraq most of subsaharan africa and other countries in a move being challenged in court refugee groups have questioned why the white south africans are being prioritized ahead of people from countries wracked by war and natural disasters vetting for refugee status in the us often takes years the trump administration says the south african government is pursuing racist antiwhite policies through affirmative action laws and a new land expropriation law it says targets afrikaners’ land the government says those claims are based on misinformation and there is no racism against afrikaners and no land has been expropriated although the contentious law has been passed and is the focus of criticism in south africa trump himself falsely claimed to reporters south africa’s leaders were “taking away land they’re confiscating land” as the financial times columnist simon kuper pointed out last year several of the most influential voices around trump “are fiftysomething white men with formative experiences in apartheid south africa” “elon musk lived in apartheid south africa until he was 17 david sacks the venture capitalist who has become a fundraiser for donald trump and a troll of ukraine left aged five and grew up in a south african diaspora family in tennessee peter thiel spent years of childhood in south africa and namibia where his father was involved in uranium mining as part of the apartheid regime’s clandestine drive to acquire nuclear weapons” kuper wrote south africa also denies us claims that afrikaners are being targeted in racially motivated attacks in some rural communities instead the south african government said afrikaners – who are the descendants of dutch and french colonial settlers – are “amongst the most economically privileged” in the country the first afrikaner refugees were traveling on a flight operated by the tulsa oklahomabased charter company omni air international msibi said they departed from johannesburg where they were accompanied by police officers and airport officials when they checked in msibi said they would have to be vetted by police to ensure there were no criminal cases or outstanding warrants against them before being allowed to leave the south african government said there was no justification for them being relocated but said it wouldn’t stop them and respected their freedom of choice they are expected to be greeted at dulles by a us government delegation including the deputy secretary of state and officials from the department of health and human services whose refugee office has organized their resettlement the flight will be the first in a “much largerscale relocation effort” the white house deputy chief of staff stephen miller told reporters on friday miller said that what was happening to afrikaners in south africa “fits the textbook definition of why the refugee program was created” view image in fullscreen south africans demonstrate in support of donald trump in front of the us

office for refugee resettlement was ready to offer them support including with housing furniture and other household items and expenses such as groceries clothing and diapers a document obtained by

million which is more than 80 black they are only one part of the country’s white minority many in south africa are puzzled by claims that afrikaners are persecuted and meet the requirements to be

A0988,2025-05-12,0,"For Silicon Valley, AI isn’t just about replacing some jobs. It’s about replacing all of them | Ed Newton-Rex",The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/12/for-silicon-valley-ai-isnt-just-about-replacing-some-jobs-its-about-replacing-all-of-them,i recently found myself at a dinner in an upstairs room at a restaurant in san francisco hosted by a venture capital firm the afterdinner speaker was a tech veteran who having sold his ai company for hundreds of millions of dollars has now turned his hand to investing he had a simple message for the assembled startup founders the money you can make in ai isn’t limited to the paltry market sizes of previous technology waves you can replace the world’s workers – which means you can capture their salaries all of them replacing all human labour with ai sounds like the stuff of science fiction but it is the explicit aim of a growing number of the tech elite – and these are people who lack neither drive nor resources who have deep pockets and even deeper determination if they say they want to automate all labour we should take them at their word this is generally an aim that’s only admitted to behind closed doors for obvious reasons there’s little that will summon the pitchforks quicker than telling people you’re trying to take away their jobs but a company called mechanize last month bucked the trend and said the quiet part out loud their vision is “the full automation of the economy” a vision they’ve convinced some of the biggest names in silicon valley to fund including google’s chief scientist jeff dean and popular podcaster dwarkesh patel is automating all jobs really feasible elon musk certainly thinks so the rise of ai and robotics will mean “probably none of us will have a job” he said last year bill gates thinks humans soon won’t be needed for “most things” massive labour replacement has also been predicted by godfather of ai geoffrey hinton and billionaire investor vinod khosla these are hardly fringe voices that have no idea what they’re talking about some careers are obviously safe from robot takeover taylor swift is not in danger nor is harry kane nor for that matter is keir starmer or the asyetunnamed next archbishop of canterbury famous artist sportsperson politician priest – perhaps the four jobs that are the most resistant to automation unfortunately they’re not open to all of us today’s technology cannot replace all human labour ai makes mistakes robots lack coordination dexterity versatility so that’s something but there is lots that cuttingedge technology can already do and there are good reasons to think it will continue to improve – fast gpt4 one of openai’s large language models was already scoring in the top 10 on the bar exam back in 2023 their more recent models are better at coding than their own chief scientist freelance writing jobs plummeted when chatgpt was released the same happened to graphic design jobs with the arrival of ai image generators driverless cars are everywhere in san francisco as sam altman himself said “jobs are definitely going to go away full stop” while ai grabs most of the headlines robots are advancing rapidly too and where ai threatens whitecollar jobs robots target physical labour one type of humanoid robot is already being tested in bmw factories another managed to master more than 100 tasks that would usually be done by human store workers companies plan to start testing robots in the home this year the silicon valley vision for the labour market is remarkably simple ai does the thinking robots do the doing what place do humans have in this arrangement up until very recently ai researchers thought that artificial general intelligence agi – that is ai that can perform essentially all cognitive tasks at human level – was a long way off not any more demis hassabis the head of google deepmind now thinks “it’s coming very soon” – less than five to 10 years wouldn’t surprise him of course these predictions may be wrong perhaps we’re headed for another ai winter perhaps the chatbots will stop improving the robots will keep falling over the funding will move on to the next big thing in tech i don’t think so but it’s possible but that’s not the point the question here isn’t whether the legions of tech ceos and billions of dollars of funding being poured into neartotal labour automation will achieve what they’re trying to achieve the question is why they’re trying to achieve it at all and how the rest of us feel about it the generous answer is that they genuinely believe a postlabour economy will mean huge economic growth and vastly improved global living standards the obvious question is what historically speaking suggests that the benefits of this growth would be distributed evenly the less generous answer is that it’s about what it’s always about money venture capitalist marc andreessen once famously said “software is eating the world” up until now there’s only been so much it could eat whatever software you built you still needed people to do most of the world’s work with the labour market itself tantalisingly out of reach for ambitious tech execs but now silicon valley sees an opening a chance to own the entire means of production and it wouldn’t be silicon valley if it didn’t try to seize that chance,,,,,,,,Fresh

A0589,06.01.25,126,Doctors worry that iodine deficiency — a dietary problem from the past — is coming back,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/iodine-deficiency-73e65282708cef12a41df3cf48a9daec,new york ap — the 13yearold boy came to the clinic with a rapidly ballooning neck doctors were puzzled testing ruled out their first suspicion but further tests pinpointed what they — and the boy — had been missing iodine a century ago iodine deficiency affected kids across large swaths of the country it essentially disappeared after some food makers started adding it to table salt bread and some other foods in one of the great public health success stories of the 20th century but today people are getting less iodine because of changes in diet and food manufacturing although most people are still getting enough researchers have increasingly been reporting low levels of iodine in pregnant women and other people raising concerns about an impact on their newborns and there is also a very small but growing number of reports of iodine deficiency in kids “this needs to be on people’s radar” said dr monica serranogonzalez a brown university doctor who treated the boy in 2021 in providence rhode island this article is part of ap’s be well coverage focusing on wellness fitness diet and mental health read more be well what is iodine iodine is a trace element found in seawater and in some soils — mostly in coastal areas a french chemist accidentally discovered it in 1811 when an experiment with seaweed ash created a purple puff of vapor the name iodine comes from a greek word meaning violetcolored later that century scientists began to understand that people need certain amounts of iodine to regulate their metabolism and stay healthy and that it’s crucial in the development of brain function in children one sign of insufficient iodine is a swelling of the neck known as a goiter the thyroid gland in the neck uses iodine to produce hormones that regulate the heart rate and other body functions when there’s not enough iodine the thyroid gland enlarges as it goes into overdrive to make up for the lack of iodine at the beginning of the 20th century goiter was very common in children in certain inland parts of the united states especially in a “goiter belt” that stretched from appalachia and the great lakes to the northwest united states some of the kids were unusually short deaf intellectually stunted and had other symptoms of a syndrome once known as “cretinism” adding iodine to salt public health experts realized they couldn’t solve the problem by feeding everyone seaweed and seafood but they learned that iodine can essentially be sprayed on table salt iodized salt first became available in 1924 by the 1950s more than 70 of us households used iodized table salt bread and some other foods also were fortified with iodine and iodine deficiency became rare but diets changed processed foods now make up a large part of the american diet and though they contain a lot of salt it’s not iodized leading bread brands no longer add iodine in the case of the 13yearold boy he has mild autism and was a fussy eater mostly only eating specific brands of bread and peanut butter and for people who do salt their food the fashion now is to use kosher salt himalayan rock salt or other noniodized products “people have forgotten why there’s iodine in salt” said dr elizabeth pearce of boston medical center she is a leader in the iodine global network a nongovernmental agency working to eliminate iodine deficiency disorders she noted a reported 50 drop in us iodine levels in surveyed americans between the 1970s and the 1990s how much iodine is enough though iodine consumption is falling overall most americans are still getting enough through their diet experts say but doctors worry that’s not the case for women and children who are most vulnerable to iodine deficiency the american academy of pediatrics and other medical societies recommend that all pregnant and breastfeeding women get 150 micrograms of iodine each day you can get that from onehalf to threequarters of a teaspoon of iodized table salt in the last 15 years or so us researchers have increasingly reported seeing mild iodine deficiency in pregnant women a michigan state university study of about 460 pregnant women in the city of lansing found about a quarter of them were not getting enough many prenatal vitamins don’t contain iodine noted jean kerver the study’s lead author that’s why doctors recommend that pregnant or breastfeeding women check labels to ensure they are taking multivitamins or prenatal supplements with iodine some studies have linked even mild iodine deficiency to lower iqs and language delay in children although there is debate about at exactly what levels problems start pearce said experts say there hasn’t been enough research to establish what impact that iodine deficiency has actually been having on the us population in recent years serranogonzalez said she and her colleagues have seen four other cases in children in their clinic in providence “we’re concerned this may be increasing especially in patients with restricted diets”

A0590,08.01.25,124,College tuition has fallen significantly at many schools,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/college-tuition-cost-5e69acffa7ae11300123df028eac5321,boston ap — the cost of college keeps spiraling ever higher right not necessarily new research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago and tuition increases at private colleges have finally slowed after years of hefty rises figures compiled by the nonprofit college board indicate the average student attending an instate public university this year faces a tuition bill of 11610 which is down 4 from a decade earlier when taking inflation into account but the real savings come in what the average student actually pays after getting grants and financial aid that’s down 40 over the decade from 4140 to 2480 annually according to the data that reduced cost means less borrowing just under half of students attending instate public universities are graduating with some debt down from 59 a decade earlier according to the college board figures and among those who do borrow the average loan balance has fallen by 17 to 27100 meanwhile at private colleges tuition continues to rise but at a much slower rate it has increased 4 over the past decade when taking inflation into account to an average 43350 according to the college board that’s a big change from the two decades prior when tuition increased 68 costs are coming down as americans question whether college is worth the price surveys find that americans are increasingly skeptical about the value of a degree and the percentage of high school graduates heading to college has fallen to levels not seen in decades according to data from the us bureau of labor statistics yet research still finds that over time a degree pays off americans with a bachelor’s degree earn a median of 28 million during their careers 75 more than if they had only a high school diploma according to research from georgetown university’s center on education and the workforce the covid19 pandemic has been a big factor in the cost reductions said jennifer ma an executive research scientist at the college board and lead author of the study “we know that during covid a lot of institutions — public and private — froze tuition” ma said as states and the federal government responded to the pandemic ma said they increased higher education funding allowing colleges to reduce the cost of attendance some of that money has since expired however including an infusion of federal pandemic aid that was mostly used up by the end of 2022 cost was a major consideration in kai mattinson’s decision to attend northern arizona university it would have cost her about 39000 annually to attend the public university but discounts and scholarships bring that down to between 15000 and 20000 for the 22yearold senior from nevada “i originally wanted to go to the university of arizona but when it came down to tuition and other cost northern arizona university was the best option” said mattinson a physical education major who also works as a longterm substitute at a local elementary school many institutions have tried to limit cost increases purdue university in indiana for example has frozen its annual instate tuition at 9992 for the past 13 years mark becker the president of the association of public and landgrant universities said he was pleased to see the new data “institutional efforts to control costs combined with many states’ efforts to increase investments in public universities and federal investment in the pell grant have increased college affordability and enabled significant progress on tackling student debt” becker said in a statement costs for those attending public twoyear community colleges have fallen even more by 9 over the past decade according to the college board data which is broadly in line with federal figures collected by the national center for education statistics still for parents paying for their children to attend outofstate public universities or private colleges the costs remain daunting — as much as 95000 annually in some cases however many institutions offer significant discounts to the sticker price for middle and lowerincome students some private colleges have been expanding their financial aid including the massachusetts institute of technology which in november announced undergraduates with a family income below 200000 would no longer need to pay any tuition at all starting in the fall other private colleges are discounting tuition as a marketing move in an increasingly difficult environment they face a dwindling pool of young adults and students who are more wary of signing up for giant loans recruiting students is crucial for staying afloat as operational costs rise after temporary relief thanks to federal money during the pandemic many colleges have cut programs to try to keep costs

A0592,22.01.25,110,Steven Soderbergh: ‘I’m the cockroach of this industry. I can survive any version of it’,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/steven-soderbergh-presence-ae40202b72deda7c29d645578a346b48,new york ap — steven soderbergh isn’t just the director and cinematographer of his latest film he’s also in a way its central character “presence” is filmed entirely from the pov of a ghost inside a home a family has just moved into soderbergh who serves as his own cinematographer under the pseudonym peter andrews his father’s name essentially performs as the presence a floating pointofview that watches as the violence that killed the mysterious ghost threatens to be repeated for even the prolific soderbergh the film which opens friday in theaters was a unique challenge he shot “presence” with a small digital camera while wearing slippers to soften his steps the 62yearold filmmaker recently met a reporter in a midtown manhattan hotel in between finishing postproduction on his other upcoming movie “black bag” a thriller focus features will release march 14 and beginning production in a few weeks on his next project a romantic comedy that he says “feels like a george cukor movie” soderbergh whose films include “out of sight” the “ocean’s 11” movies “magic mike” and “erin brockovich” tends to do a lot in small windows of time “presence” took 11 days to film that dexterous proficiency has made the everexperimenting soderbergh one of hollywood’s most widely respected evaluators of the movie business in a wideranging conversation he discussed why he thinks streaming is the most destructive force the movies have ever faced and why he’s “the cockroach of this industry” ap you use pseudonyms for yourself as a cinematographer and editor were you tempted to credit yourself as an actor for “presence” soderbergh no but what i did is subtle for the first and only time peter andrews has a camera operator credit that’s not a credit that i typically take because i don’t need it and i typically have another operator working with me but i felt like this was a workout it was tricky but really fun it was another level of performance anxiety because i ruined more takes than anyone else in the film by a larger factor i was the one going “cut i f—ed that up we got to go again” ap you made this quickly and inexpensively and then sold it to a distributor was it appealing to work outside the system soderbergh the beauty of projects at this scale is i can just do them without having to talk to anybody it’s not because i don’t want notes it’s because it’s just the brain trust and none of the psychic real estate is taken up by things that have nothing to do with what you’re going to shoot i went from that into a more traditional project in which a lot of psychic real estate gets taken up by the process of having a studio finance your movie i like these people it’s just a lot of lawyers like a lot of lawyers ap you’ve called streaming the most destructive force in movie history what most irks you about it soderbergh it removes a key reference point for an artist it’s helpful to know how something is doing or how it did you need to know that to calibrate whether you accomplished what you wanted to accomplish whether you can work at a certain level that’s one of the most confusing things about it the black box of it apart from the economic invisibility of what’s going on there — the fact that we can’t really look under the hood of how these streaming companies work economically — there’s another kind of handrail that’s missing that i find really helpful at the end of the day i at least want to know the market will tell you how you’re doing i want to know that so i can adjust or go in another direction being irrelevant isn’t very appealing what is the overlap between what people seem to be responding to and what i like because i don’t want to make these things and have nobody see them i’ve had enough people say “oh did that come out” it’s a public art form ap how do you suspect the audience is changing soderbergh the good news is if you talk to focus features and neon and a24 young people are going to the movies this is the letterboxd generation that’s fantastic i hope that ripples outside the us they are cineliterate and they expect something singular they want the signature they want the stamp of a filmmaker and that’s turning into a real business one of the things i think we all need to do but especially the people who cover the industry is to stop using the studio metric for what a success is that’s not a template you should be applying to everything ap do you ever lament that the movies that made you want to be a filmmaker like “all the president’s men” and “chinatown” occupied a different place in the culture than today’s films soderbergh there was a period of about 10 to 14 year where the best movies of the year were also the most popular movies of the year that’s not necessarily true anymore you can pick one of the movies that’s in the hunt this year and go that’s a ’70s movie that’s as good and interesting as one of those but it’s not going to do the business that one of those would have done it’s the artist’s job to adapt when it comes to trying to control what people want to go see you’re now in a place like “if i really wish hard it won’t rain” the weather is the weather to a certain degree the audience is a weather system luckily because of the way i began i’m the cockroach of this industry i can survive any version of it ap you’ve described feeling a need to immediately “annihilate” whatever you just made by starting on something vastly different soderbergh yeah when you see “black bag” you’re like “oh that’s different” there are more shots in the first four minutes of “black bag” than the entirety of “presence” it’s a different thing and it has different demands ap it’s not exhausting to reinvent yourself every movie soderbergh no it feels more like a natural evolution and a natural response in the sense of i want to be a different filmmaker for this i don’t want to know the outcome if you have a conversation with a filmmaker who says they have “figured things out” you should run in the other direction it’s like you’re deluded and you have a very superficial understanding of what this art form demands if you’re not humbled by what it asks of you to be distinctive ap do you feel you’ve gotten closer there might not be a filmmaker alive who’s tried more ways to make a movie than you have soderbergh no i still feel like i’m reaching for something i quite possibly won’t ever grasp and maybe shouldn’t as frustrating as it may be to feel like i’ve never made a thing that is at the level of one of my heroes made i don’t know what i’d do if i did feel that do you stop then the movie “come and see” that guy got to basically go “that’s my mic drop” i’ve never made anything approaching that ap it wouldn’t be the only film i’d suggest but i think “out of sight” is pretty darn perfect soderbergh oh i’m very happy with that film i’m very proud of that film i can’t say there’s much in it that i’d go back and change that said it’s not “apocalypse now” or “the third man” by my standards i don’t look at it and go “that’s as good as ‘the third man’” i’m good at pushing myself into areas that are slightly beyond my comfort zone but i also understand what my limitations are i’m inherently not a grandiose thinker about myself or my work that’s a critical component to some of the films i’m talking about that i think are amazing i could never make “apocalypse now” i don’t think of myself as a filmmaker the way francis ford coppola thinks of himself that’s not he should be like me or i should be like him it’s just how we’re built i’m more earthbound i guess is the word and that’s what i like and what i’m good at ap do you have any idea why soderbergh i think it’s the way i was born and the way i was raised and the people who were around me when i was younger who mentored me i just don’t think i was born with the grandiosity gene and there was nobody around me who would have cultivated that even if i had shown signs going to sundance last year with “presence” was really gratifying if you’d told me 35 years later you’re going to come back here where “sex lies and videotape” premiered in 1989 with a movie that people are interested in seeing i would have wept,Old

A0594,31.01.25,101,Trump administration fires prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 cases and moves toward ousting FBI agents,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/trump-fbi-firing-a7b19a5f414ce82c6f6b5f6656000d23,washington ap — the trump administration on friday fired a group of prosecutors involved in the jan 6 criminal cases and demanded the names of fbi agents involved in those same probes so they can possibly be ousted moves that reflect a white house determination to exert control over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees seen as insufficiently loyal acting deputy attorney general emil bove ordered the firings of the jan 6 prosecutors days after president donald trump’s sweeping clemency action benefiting the more than 1500 people charged in the us capitol attack according to a memo obtained by the associated press about two dozen employees at the us attorney’s office in washington were terminated said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel issues a separate memo by bove identified more than a halfdozen fbi senior executives who were ordered to retire or be fired by monday and also asked for the names titles and offices of all fbi employees who worked on investigations into the jan 6 2021 us capitol riot — a list the bureau’s acting director said could number in the thousands bove who has defended trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration said justice department officials would then carry out a “review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary” “as we’ve said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles we are going to follow the law follow fbi policy and do what’s in the best interest of the workforce and the american people — always” acting fbi director brian driscoll wrote in a letter to the workforce the prosecutors fired in the dc us attorney’s office had been hired for temporary assignments to support the jan 6 cases but were moved into permanent roles after trump’s presidential win in november according to the memo obtained by the ap bove the acting deputy attorney general said he would not “tolerate subversive personnel actions by the previous administration” any mass firings at the fbi would be a major blow to the historic independence from the white house of the nation’s premier federal law enforcement agency but would be in keeping with trump’s persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will it would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees following the forced ousters of a group of senior fbi executives earlier this week as well as a broad termination by the justice department of prosecutors on special counsel jack smith’s team who investigated trump the fbi agents association said the reported efforts to oust agents represented “outrageous actions by acting officials” that were “fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by president trump and his support for fbi agents” “dismissing potentially hundreds of agents would severely weaken the bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the bureau and its new leadership for failure” the association said in a statement it was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might take but the bureau has a welldefined process for terminations and any abrupt action that bypasses that protocol could presumably open the door to a legal challenge when pressed during his confirmation hearing thursday trump’s pick for fbi director kash patel said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish fbi employees who were involved in the trump investigations patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the fbi’s internal review processes for taking action against employees asked by democratic sen cory booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that don’t follow that standard process patel said “i don’t know what’s going on right now over there but i’m committed to you senator and your colleagues that i will honor the due process of the fbi” before he was nominated for the director’s position patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about what he called antitrump “conspirators” in the government and news media who he said needed to be rooted out trump has for years expressed fury at the fbi and justice department over investigations that shadowed his presidency including an inquiry into ties between russia and his 2016 campaign and continued over the last four years he fired one fbi director james comey amid the russia investigation and then replaced his second christopher wray just weeks after his win in november asked at the

came after a lot of people — like me – but they came after a lot of people” he added “if they fired some people over there that’s a good thing because they were very bad” the fbi and smith’s team investigated trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his maralago estate in florida both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after trump’s november presidential win because of longstanding justice department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president the justice department also charged more than 1500 trump supporters in connection with the capitol riot though trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them — including the ones convicted of violent crimes — through pardons sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments this week the justice department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on smith investigations and a group of senior fbi

A0602,07.03.25,66,Fed Chair Powell says interest rates on hold with economic uncertainty widespread,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-prices-67791b46f1ad3c197975a75ee35226be,new york ap — the federal reserve is likely to keep its key interest rate unchanged in the coming months as it waits for widespread “uncertainty” stemming from president donald trump’s policies to resolve chair jerome powell said friday at a conference in new york powell said the trump administration is making policy changes in several areas including trade taxes government spending immigration and regulation and added that the “net effect” of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the fed’s interest rate policies “while there have been recent developments in some of these areas especially trade policy uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high” powell said “as we parse the incoming information we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves we do not need to be in a hurry and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity” most economists say that trump’s plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports including 25 duties on goods from canada and mexico that he partially delayed thursday will push up prices and slow growth but many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy powell’s comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the fed may deliver this year they had been banking on at least three following a stream of weakerthanexpected reports on the us economy but powell reiterated the fed is likely on hold for a while that sent treasury yields higher in the bond market rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages auto loans credit cards and business loans powell in a question and answer session acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a “onetime” price increase rather than persistent inflation and the fed could ignore such a temporary effect treasury secretary scott bessent on thursday made a similar argument “we could get a onetime price adjustment” bessent said before adding “i’m not worried about inflation” yet powell also said there were other considerations the fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged or even raise rates for example powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a onetime impact “if it turns into a series” of tariff hikes or “if the increases are larger that would matter” “what really does matter is what is happening with longterm inflation expectations” powell added powell noted that shorterterm expectations have risen partly out of concern about tariffs though longerterm expectations have been stable expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase when trump imposed tariffs in his last administration powell noted the fed ended up reducing its key rate “because growth weakened so much” powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite “elevated uncertainty” he characterized friday’s jobs report which showed employers added 151000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 41 as in line with the “solid” gains of the past six months he also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year and said surveys of consumers and businesses “point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook” further complicating matters he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment “have not been a good predictor” of consumer spending in recent years the fed’s own beige book a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released wednesday up from just 17 times in january the fed publishes the beige book eight times a year powell spoke at a conference organized by the university of chicago’s booth school of business president donald trump’s onagain offagain tariff policy and rapidfire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy’s growth to as low as 1 at an annual rate in the first three months of this year down from 23 in last year’s final quarter yet as fed governor christopher waller noted thursday there are “good news” cuts and “bad news” cuts “bad news” cuts occur if the fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing while “good news” reductions are those that reflect a sense by the fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2 waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the fed to engineer “good news” rate cuts later this year though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the fed’s next meeting this month after cutting its key rate three times last year to about 43 powell indicated in january that the fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation

york ap — a public memorial service bursting with music including planned performances by stevie wonder and a surprise one by lauryn hill and wyclef jean of the fugees celebrated the life and legacy of the grammywinning singer and pianist roberta flack flack whose intimate vocal and musical style made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after died last month at age 88 she’s bestknown for her transformative covers of “the first time ever i saw your face” and “killing me softly with his song” both were expertly handled by hill at the ceremony held monday afternoon at new york’s abyssinian baptist church wonder followed the set and the rev al sharpton gave the eulogy flack “put a soundtrack to black dignity” sharpton said as many said in their tributes flack’s musical genius stemmed from her ability to seamlessly move between soul jazz gospel and beyond her “celebration of life” memorial was livestreamed at wwwrobertaflackcom and on youtube here are some highlights for the memory of a singing legend a historic location flack’s memorial was open to the public at the abyssinian baptist church a historic harlem institution founded in 1808 it is one of the oldest black baptist churches in the us the church was decorated for the ceremony with stunning white and yellow bouquets seats filled quickly at center a screen showed a young flack at the piano and played highlights of her career later it would broadcast music industry legends paying tribute to flack including clive davisdionne warwick indiaarie and alicia keys it was a fitting location for such a celebration flack grew up with church gospel and her mother played organ at the lomax african methodist episcopal church in arlington virginia as a teen she began accompanying the church choir on piano the ceremony detoured from a program handed out to attendees it featured a powerful quote from flack on the back that arie would include in her message “remember always walk in the light” flack once said “if you feel like you’re not walking in it go find it love the light” celebrating a life in music — through music “her existence was a form of resistance” hill said in her speech holding back tears hill’s appearance was unexpected but fitting in the 1990s her hiphop trio the fugees did a masterful take on flack’s cover “killing me softly with his song” it won the group a grammy two decades after flack took home the record of the year trophy for the song “i adore ms roberta flack” she said “roberta flack is legend” she then launched into a cover of “the first time ever i saw your face” followed by “killing me softly with his song” with the fugees’ wyclef jean — and wonder joining in on harmonica a legend who needed no introduction but certainly received one with roaring applause wonder followed up “the great thing about not having the ability to see with your eyes is the great opportunity of being able to even better see with your heart and so i knew how beautiful roberta was not seeing her visually but being able to see and feel her heart” wonder said he performed his song “if it’s magic” accompanied only by a harpist then he sat at the piano to sing with the harpist a song he wrote for flack “i can see the sun in late december” “i love you roberta and i will see you” wonder said at the end earlier songwriter and performer valerie simpson of ashford simpson played piano and sang an extended take of “ain’t nothing like the real thing” interspersed with recollections of her friend “but that voice aw she’d just grab you in the heart and then when she touched the keys she knew how to dig down deep” simpson said simpson recalled being tapped to perform in “chicago” for her 2018 broadway debut and how she told flack she wasn’t sure if she could act “she looked at me and said ‘girl where’s the script bring it over here we’re going to work on this thing we’re going to do this’” remembered simpson new orleans singer and piano player davell crawford performed a soulful version of flack’s song “just when i needed you” to celebratory shouts and cheers a legendary artist remembered “many of us are here today because she has touched not just our hearts but she also touched our souls” said the rev dr kevin r johnson the senior church pastor who led the service choir performances including a rousing rendition of “amazing grace” came in between a video recollection of flack’s life and scripture readings “the reason we’re here is because she made a difference” sharpton said and we should all ask ourselves when it comes our time will they pack a church for you if roberta were here tonight she would tell you ‘don’t just praise me emulate me’” actor phylicia rashad remembered first seeing flack perform when she was a student at howard university — to an audience that grew rapt by her quiet steady voice flack lived comfortably with her genius and without having to proclaim it to people rashad said “she wore that like a loose fitting garment and lived her life attending to that which she cared for most music love and humanity” rashad said mead gruver contributed to this report from cheyenne wyoming,Mid-aged
A0605,11.03.25,62,EEUU cancela duplicar aranceles a acero canadiense luego que Ontario suspende aumento a electricidad,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/trump-aranceles-canada-c00eb68af7ea36aa48df270e81602dcf,washington ap — la amenaza que lanzó el presidente donald trump el martes de duplicar los aranceles sobre el acero y el aluminio canadiense del 25 al 50 llevó al gobierno de la provincia de ontario a ordenar la suspensión de su plan de aplicar recargos al precio de la electricidad que vende a estados unidos como resultado el asesor comercial de la casa blanca peter navarro dijo que el presidente estadounidense dio marcha atrás en su decisión de duplicar los aranceles sobre el acero y el aluminio aunque el gobierno federal aún planea imponer un gravamen del 25 sobre todas las importaciones de acero y aluminio a partir del miércoles la respuesta de canadá representó una victoria para trump pero también aumentó las preocupaciones en torno a las medidas arancelarias que han agitado al mercado de valores y suscitado riesgos de una recesión la escalada y el enfriamiento en la actual guerra comercial entre estados unidos y canadá únicamente incrementaron la creciente sensación de incertidumbre sobre cómo los aumentos de aranceles de trump afectarán a las economías de ambas naciones trump estremeció los mercados la mañana del martes al afirmar que el aumento de los aranceles que entraría en vigor el miércoles había sido una respuesta al aumento del 25 en el precio de la electricidad que ontario vende a estados unidos “he ordenado a mi secretario de comercio para que añada un arancel adicional del 25 llevándolo al 50 sobre todo el acero y aluminio que ingresa a estados unidos desde canadá una de las naciones con los aranceles más altos de cualquier lugar del mundo” publicó trump el martes en su plataforma truth social el primer ministro de ontario doug ford declaró el martes por la tarde que recibió una llamada del secretario de comercio de estados unidos howard lutnick tras la cual acordó eliminar el incremento de precios añadió que estaba seguro de que el presidente de estados unidos también daría marcha atrás a sus propios planes de aranceles del 50 sobre el acero y el aluminio canadienses “tiene que consultarlo con el presidente pero estoy bastante seguro de que dará marcha atrás” dijo ford sobre la amenaza de trump de gravar el acero y aluminio “de ninguna manera vamos a someternos lo que vamos a hacer es tener una conversación constructiva” después de la caída en los mercados del lunes y el subsecuente nerviosismo el martes trump se enfrenta a una creciente presión por demostrar que cuenta un plan sólido para hacer crecer la economía hasta ahora el mandatario ha ratificado su postura sobre los aranceles y puede señalar el drama del martes como evidencia de que los impuestos sobre las importaciones son una valiosa herramienta de negociación incluso si generan agitación en el mercado de valores trump insinuó el martes que los aranceles son fundamentales para cambiar la economía de estados unidos independientemente de las oscilaciones del mercado de valores el mandatario estadounidense ha dado distintas explicaciones para su antagonismo hacia canadá señaló que sus aranceles del 25 sobre todas las importaciones algunos de los cuales quedaron suspendidos durante un mes se deben al contrabando de fentanilo y ha expresado objeciones a que canadá imponga altos gravámenes a las importaciones de productos lácteos que castigan a los granjeros estadounidenses también ha mantenido su llamado para que canadá se convierta en parte de estados unidos como solución una forma de burla que ha enfurecido a los gobernantes canadienses “lo único que tiene sentido es que canadá se convierta en nuestro querido quincuagésimo primer estado” publicó trump el martes “esto haría que todos los aranceles y todo lo demás desaparezca por completo” tensiones entre estados unidos y canadá el primer ministro entrante de canadá mark carney dijo que su gobierno mantendrá los aranceles hasta que los estadounidenses muestren respeto y se comprometan con el libre comercio después de que trump amenazó con una devastación financiera histórica para canadá carney quien tomará posesión en lugar de justin trudeau en los próximos días dijo que los más recientes aranceles de trump son un ataque a los trabajadores las familias y las empresas canadienses “mi gobierno mantendrá nuestros aranceles hasta que los estadounidenses nos muestren respeto y asuman compromisos creíbles y fiables con el comercio libre y justo” dijo carney en un comunicado los funcionarios canadienses planean imponer aranceles de represalia en respuesta al gravamen sobre el acero y el aluminio los cuales se tiene previsto que se den a conocer el miércoles carney se refería la primera ronda de aranceles de represalia de canadá por 30000 millones de dólares canadienses 21000 millones de dólares estadounidenses que se han aplicado a productos estadounidenses como el jugo de naranja la mantequilla de cacahuate el café los electrodomésticos el calzado los cosméticos las motocicletas y determinados productos de pulpa y papel trump también ha impuesto a méxico aranceles del 25 debido a su descontento con el narcotráfico y la inmigración ilegal aunque suspendió durante un mes los impuestos a las importaciones que cumplen con el pacto comercial tmec firmado en 2020 cuando se le preguntó sobre si méxico temía enfrentarse a los mismos aranceles del 50 sobre el acero y el aluminio que canadá la presidenta claudia sheinbaum dijo “no nosotros somos respetuosos” trump participó el martes en una sesión de preguntas y respuestas con business roundtable una asociación comercial de ceo a la que cortejó durante la campaña de 2024 con la promesa de tasas impositivas corporativas más bajas para los fabricantes nacionales pero sus aranceles sobre canadá méxico china y posiblemente más sobre europa brasil corea del sur medicamentos farmacéuticos cobre madera y microprocesadores— equivaldrían a un enorme aumento de impuestos el voto de desconfianza del mercado de valores durante las últimas dos semanas pone al presidente en un dilema entre su entusiasmo por gravar las importaciones y su imagen como un político que entiende de negocios basado en sus propias experiencias en bienes raíces medios y marketing “los aranceles están teniendo un impacto sumamente positivo — lo tendrán y lo están teniendo” declaró trump ante la reunión de ceo afirmando que los impuestos a las importaciones harían que más fábricas se reubiquen en estados unidos aumentan las preocupaciones de una recesión el economista de la universidad de harvard larry summers secretario del tesoro durante el gobierno de bill clinton calcula que las probabilidades de una recesión son 5050 el banco de inversión goldman sachs ajustó a la baja su pronóstico de crecimiento para este año de 22 a 17 aumentó modestamente su probabilidad de recesión al 20 “porque la casa blanca tiene la opción de revertir los cambios de política si los riesgos a la baja comienzan a parecer más serios” trump ha tratado de asegurar al público que sus aranceles causarían una cierta “transición” para la economía en la que los impuestos han impulsado a más empresas a comenzar un proceso de varios años para reubicar sus fábricas en estados unidos a fin de evitar los aranceles pero el domingo encendió las alarmas durante una entrevista en la que no descartó una posible recesión continúa el desplome del mercado de valores la promesa de grandes cosas por venir no eliminó la ansiedad y el índice bursátil sp 500 cayó 27 el lunes lo que ha borrado las ganancias con las que el mercado recibió la victoria electoral de trump en noviembre de 2024 el índice sp 500 cayó aproximadamente un 08 en las operaciones del martes por la tarde recuperándose de una caída inicial después de que ontario dio marcha atrás a su incremento en los precios de la electricidad trump ha confiado desde hace tiempo en el mercado de valores como un indicador económico y político a seguir sólo para aparentemente ignorarlo mientras sigue decidido hasta ahora a imponer aranceles cuando ganó las elecciones el año pasado proclamó que quería que se considerara que su mandato había comenzado el 6 de noviembre de 2024 el día de las elecciones en lugar de la fecha de su toma de posesión del 20 de enero de 2025 para que se le pudieran atribuir las ganancias bursátiles postelectorales trump también advirtió repetidamente de una caída libre de la economía si perdía las elecciones “si no gano tendrán una depresión al estilo de 1929 disfrútenla” dijo trump durante un

1995 zephaniah joined bomb the bass and sinéad o’connor to deliver a critique of colonialism in this triphopinfluenced production imagining a lifesucking vampire as a metaphor for empire tim simenon aka bomb the bass says “i remember smoking a lot of weed with sinéad while recording empire she sang the lead vocal in one take then added harmonies and backing vocals” simenon instinctively knew that zephaniah’s voice would contrast powerfully “he was such a warm open guy we spent a long day in the studio bouncing ideas around until we landed on the spacious delivery we recorded he gave the final mix an approving head nod – he was super pleased with the result we mostly spoke about music especially dub we shared a love for big youth lee ‘scratch’ perry and onu sound” lb dub corp i have a dream

debating vegan food in china” reflecting on their final exchange slater said “benjamin had just received the album copies i sent and told me he played the track for his students i was humbled i miss him in this dimension but his words live on” he had intended to ask him to collaborate a second time “then a week later he was gone he left too soon his words always carried a message – not always comfortable never bland his delivery cut through class barriers and reached people from all walks of life” swayzak – illegal ft benjamin zephaniah 2000 the duo swayzak captured zephaniah’s rebellious spirit in this unapologetically anarchic track “working with benjamin was an unexpected delight” says james s taylor “there was no ego no pressure just good vibes” the collaboration quickly grew into a friendship “we talked deeply about politics and the british empire” david brown says “the brummie west indian poet – quite a person to have in one’s life” a 2024 “redraft” of zephaniah’s 1999 poem illegal was released under the title do something illegal as a tribute to zephaniah under brown’s ambient alias the eightsome reel the track ends with the sound of heavy rain recorded the day brown

A0619,17.04.25,25,Some Pennsylvania Jews reminded of Tree of Life shooting after arson attack on Josh Shapiro’s home,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/joshshapiroarsonantisemitism-789c12954a3c91ae045f7778f934bb4f,harrisburg pa ap — a year ago carole zawatsky was invited by pennsylvania gov josh shapiro to a passover seder held in the same room at the governor’s official residence that was devastated by an arsonist just hours after shapiro hosted this year’s jewish holiday feast now as she looks at photos of the destruction zawatsky can envision where she had been seated and how deadly the attack could have been like many others zawatsky is cautiously awaiting word from investigators about the motivations of the attacker which are clouded by hints of erratic behavior as well as statements from his past still the attack hit the jewish community hard in a state where such pain is achingly familiar it targeted pennsylvania’s religiously observant jewish governor in the very place where just hours before he had hosted one of the central rituals of the jewish calendar zawatsky heads a pittsburgh organization formed to counter antisemitism and memorialize the victims of another pennsylvania assault – the murders of 11 worshippers from three congregations at the tree of life synagogue more than six years ago the deadliest antisemitic attack in us history “seeing those images is deeply traumatic” said zawatsky ceo of the tree of life the group established in the wake of the oct 27 2018 killings “it’s not too much to ask that we all live in a country where we celebrate our faith without fear” a murkier picture emerges on motive the synagogue shooting trial revealed that the gunman who was convicted and sentenced to death had long been steeped in antisemitism and methodically carried out the attack in the harrisburg case things are less clear investigators have released only fragments of what the suspect cody balmer of harrisburg told them his relatives say he has struggled with mental illness and his lawyers suggested wednesday that will be central to their defense “we have no definitive information about this person’s motive” zawatsky said “we do know that there was certainly hate involved” pennsylvania state police said the 38yearold balmer confessed to the attack harbored hatred for the governor and said he planned to beat shapiro with a hammer “balmer identified himself by name and related that governor josh shapiro needs to know that he ‘will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the palestinian people’” police wrote as part of applications for search warrants exactly who and what that meant were unclear in the documents senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york on thursday called on the justice department to determine whether the attack qualifies as a federal hate crime audrey glickman a survivor of the 2018 attack and a member of tree of life congregation said she admired shapiro’s composure just hours after the attack and his emphatic denunciation of hatred regardless of motivation “it takes a while to realize you’ve been attacked and what to make of it” glickman said she admired “how he stood up right away and spoke strongly about it” shapiro responded to the scene of the 2018 pittsburgh attack as pennsylvania’s thenattorney general as governor he took part in the 2024 groundbreaking for a new building to replace the synagogue including a memorial programming and other exhibits aimed to counter antisemitism reminders of an overheated political climate about 200 people participated in a somber march wednesday night in harrisburg they walked from the parking lot of a synagogue to the governor’s residence where they held a multifaith prayer vigil across the street several marchers connected the attack to the overheated political climate “to deny it is like putting your head in the sand” said retired presbyterian minister don potter 75 of dillsburg who said the images of the building’s interior with fire damage “made me sick” enid wassner a retired child care worker from hershey said the fact that the firebombing occurring during passover and targeted shapiro and his family was “extremely worrying” she noted that jewish institutions and buildings in harrisburg have had to increase security “gradually things have been getting more worrisome for me personally and the entire jewish community” questions emerge about attacker’s mental state police said in court affidavits that in an interview with detectives balmer “admitted to harboring hatred towards” shapiro and referred to the palestinian people in a 911 call attributed to him that was placed shortly after the breakin balmer’s mother and brother have said he suffered from bipolar disorder and would not consistently take medication his brother dan balmer said cody balmer twice in recent years spent time in a psychiatric hospital in harrisburg during a court hearing on monday balmer denied any history of mental illness dan balmer told the ap on tuesday that cody balmer “had these theories that were going on in his head” and became angry when family members would tell him his views didn’t reflect reality “the allegations if true demonstrate the devastating consequences of severe mental illness” mary klatt the chief public defender in dauphin county whose office is representing balmer said wednesday she said his preliminary hearing would be delayed to determine whether balmer is mentally competent to stand trial identity moves to forefront for shapiro shapiro declined to talk about the attacker’s motive on wednesday saying prosecutors will ultimately determine what drove him “it’s not for me to answer that” he said the governor has publicly criticized israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s government and the nature of israel’s military action in gaza but also has backed israel’s right to defend itself from hamas hank butler executive director of the pennsylvania jewish coalition said shapiro’s focus has been pennsylvania and not the palestinian people “to say that our governor wishes the worst on the palestinian people is not welcomed here” butler said “it is not justified absolutely not justified no attack is justified” shapiro has won statewide races three times in a crucial battleground state he was a finalist to be vice president kamala harris’s running mate in last year’s presidential campaign and is considered a potential 2028 democratic candidate for president the attack once again puts his identity front and center when harris picked minnesota gov tim walz over shapiro republicans tried to cast the pick as a snub to jewish voters rabbi rick jacobs president of the union for reform judaism an umbrella group for more than 800 reform congregations in north america connected the attack to shapiro’s identity “he’s also someone who is a strong supporter of israel” jacobs said of shapiro “are those things that put your life at risk in the 21st century” zawatsky the tree of life ceo noted that in the passover ritual jews are instructed not just to recite the story of their ancient forebears’ liberation from slavery but to envision themselves as having experienced it – something that feels especially poignant now whether law enforcement officials ultimately settle on a definitive conclusion about what motivated last weekend’s attack she and others already know what living in fear feels like “it’s very sad to think we pass along the inherited trauma of the fear of antisemitism but never did i think we would be a generation that would have the lived experience of this kind of violent antisemitism” she said associated press

major escalation in the military campaign president donald trump launched against the faction last month the overnight strike on the ras isa port sent massive fireballs billowing skyward and turned tanker trucks into burning wrecks it was the first american attack on a houthicontrolled oil facility in the new us bombing campaign it also came just before the resumption of negotiations in rome between the us and iran over tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program which washington has linked to its attacks in yemen the us is targeting the houthis because of the group’s attacks on shipping in the red sea a crucial global trade route and on israel the houthis are the last militant group in iran’s selfdescribed “axis of resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking israel the port is a major hub for incoming fuel shipments that power areas of yemen held by the houthis and analysts say the airstrike could seriously affect daily life there the houthis who said the attack killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others aired graphic footage of the aftermath on their almasirah satellite news channel showing corpses strewn about the port and smashed tanker trucks they denounced

has funded houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years” it said in its statement a us official said the attack sent a message to those supplying fuel to the houthis despite sanctions the official spoke to the associated press on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public hours after the us strike the houthis launched a missile toward israel that was intercepted the israeli military said sirens sounded in tel aviv and elsewhere meanwhile the houthis said they shot down another american mq9 predator drone which the us official acknowledged the port’s strategic significance the ras isa port is a collection of oil tanks and equipment that sits in yemen’s hodeida governorate along the red sea it is just off kamaran island which has been targeted by intense us airstrikes in recent days before the houthis took control of yemen’s capital sanaa in 2014 and sent the government into exile oil from the country’s energyrich marib governorate moved through ras isa for export but since the houthis don’t control that region the port now serves as an import hub for gasoline diesel and liquefied petroleum gas that help power those parts of yemen the houthis control a deadly escalation of trump’s yemen campaign the new us operation against the houthis under trump appears more extensive than attacks on the group were under president joe biden an ap review found the new campaign started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting “israeli” ships again over israel blocking aid from entering the gaza strip from november 2023 until this january the houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones sinking two of them and killing four sailors that has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the red sea corridor which typically sees 1 trillion of goods move through it the houthis also launched attacks targeting american warships without success assessing the toll of the monthold us airstrike campaign

civilian areas there’s a lot more victims but it’s also difficult to assess how many because the houthis are releasing these umbrella statements that cover all the victims or tend to stress only the civilian victims” nevola said further complicating the situation is the us strikes hitting military targets said mohammed albasha a yemen expert at the basha report risk advisory firm he pointed to an american attack that trump highlighted online with blackandwhite strike footage which might have killed about 70 fighters “although the houthis claimed it was a tribal gathering they neither released any footage nor named a single casualty strongly suggesting the victims were not civilians but affiliated fighters” albasha said “however the overnight strike on the ras isa fuel port marks the first masscasualty incident the houthis have openly acknowledged and publicized” the ap analyzed satellite images of the port provided by planet labs pbc that showed destroyed oil tanks and vehicles and

A0623,18.04.25,24,The Sharks look to a brighter future after 2nd straight season with the NHL’s worst record,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/sharks-nhl-b06ac60b454987c2c47798e681055e00,san jose calif ap — the end result wasn’t much different for the san jose sharks with a second straight season finishing at the bottom of the nhl standings the way they got there with promising play from a young core led by talented rookies macklin celebrini and will smith and far more competitive play on the ice offers hope that one of the four franchises to miss the playoffs each of the last six seasons is not far off from getting back to playoff contention “it was a step forward” general manager mike grier said friday “it was disappointing to still finish the season where we did it’s still a wins and loss league at the end of the day to some degree you are what your record says you are that’s the kind of frustrating disappointing piece of it all because i think the group played better definitely more competitive and everything but there’s still a long ways to go” the sharks finished the season 205012 for a leaguelow 52 points — five more than last season — as they became the first team in 10 years to lose at least 50 games in regulation in backtoback seasons the team improved its goal differential by 44 goals from the previous season but still finished last in the nhl in both goals scored and goals allowed “it was a season of frustration” firstyear coach ryan warsofsky said “i think there’s some growth individually and as a group but obviously we have a lot of work to do” grier said the priority this offseason will be improving defensively with the hope that the team can be better at protecting leads the sharks lost 10 times in regulation this season after holding a lead in the third period — no other team in the league had more than four — and had five more losses in overtime or shootouts after leading in the third their eight regulation losses this season when leading at the end of the second period were the most for any team in eight years and tied for the most in the nhl in any season since at least 197071 “it’s a fine line between winning and losing in this league” warsofsky said “it’s usually one play here or there or two plays a save here or there and that’s the game we saw that this year our players saw that this year we’ll see that in the playoffs this year i’m glad we went through those at the time it was tough but hopefully everything happens for a reason and we can learn from those” warsofsky attributes some of those issues to the youth of the team which is also the biggest selling point for improvement next season celebrini the first pick of last year’s draft had a sensational season as an 18yearold leading all rookies with 25 goals ranking second with 63 points and playing as a topline center often against the opponent’s best players celebrini talked about wanting to cut down on his turnovers and warsofsky said knowing when to take chances will come with more experience “i can’t say enough great things about this kid” warsofsky said “the way he works the way he competes to how driven he is his natural leadership ability he’s a winner through and through he’s going to help this organization win hockey games very very soon and he already has there’s some things that every player needs to work on mac really drags guys into the fight the way he competes we’re very very happy with his season” smith the fourth overall pick in 2023 also showed promise as a rookie with 18 goals and 45 points playing his best at the end of the season the sharks got contributions from several other young players including william eklund shakir mukhamadullin collin graf and henry thrun and are hoping that yaroslav askarov can seize the job as no 1 goalie next season with several more young prospects in the pipeline and two firstround picks — including one in the top three — there is reason for optimism especially if the sharks can use their cap room to add a few key veterans this offseason “i think around the league people see we have some really really good young players and they’re coming and they’re coming quick” warsofsky said “we have great people in this organization i think that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel that this team is on the up and up” ap nhl httpsapnewscomnhl,Recent

A0629,22.04.25,20,Pope Francis’ conservative critics had a unique way to oppose him: a retired pontiff,AP News,https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-critics-fef5eb221e1a44a15fa7bb9aa83b9d73,vatican city ap — as amazonian bishops gathered at the vatican on oct 21 2019 a man entered a nearby church after dawn and stole three indigenous statues brought to rome for the occasion he threw them into the tiber river in a videotaped protest to denounce what he called the “pagan idolatry” taking place on pope francis’ watch the incident underscored the lengths to which pope francis’ traditionalist critics were willing to go to vent their opposition to history’s first latin american pope from individual protests to social media campaigns conferences and petitions conservatives made clear they believed themselves to be more catholic than the pope and forged unusually vocal resistance to his authority their token leaders in the college of cardinals will likely be maneuvering to ensure someone more sympathetic to their sensibilities will be elected to replace francis who died monday at 88 ‘some wanted me dead’ every pope has his critics and francis probably expected he would face opposition to his radical reform agenda after catholics for two generations grew used to more conservative popes “some wanted me dead” he quipped once after he heard some prelates in rome had started plotting a future conclave while he was in the hospital francis’ critics were unique in having a living alternate as a point of reference pope benedict xvi who resided as pope emeritus in the vatican gardens for the first decade of francis’ pontificate such an anomaly made the dynamics of the francis opposition a historical first it exacerbated divisions that experts say must be addressed before another pope decides to step down they say norms are necessary to prevent a retired pope from being an inspiration for the faithful in ways that discredit his successor or impact his leadership francis tolerated the rightwing opposition for a while often responding to their attacks with silence at times he even seemed to relish in the criticism as evidence of how far a church “obsessed” with rules and regulations had strayed from jesus’ gospelmandated call to welcome the stranger feed the poor and show mercy to all “it’s an honor if the americans attack me” he once said referring to the usbased nexus of opposition after benedict’s death in 2022 francis tried to blunt the opposition and consolidate his progressive reforms even though it seemed the rightwing knives were out for him within days of benedict’s funeral his longtime secretary published a tellall memoir highly critical of francis it also emerged posthumously that cardinal george pell wrote a devastating memo that circulated anonymously calling francis’ pontificate a “catastrophe” while saying he welcomed criticism francis tried to neutralize the opposition through key appointments and targeted removals even while trying to make the church a welcoming “field hospital for wounded souls” especially lgbtq catholics after one gesture of outreach — francis approved blessings for samesex couples — african bishops united in disapproval in a remarkable continentwide dissent to a papal directive “if you look at all the history of the reform of the church where you have the strongest resistance or debated points it’s really usually a very important point” said sister nathalie becquart who helped spearhead one of francis’ progressive agenda items to make the church more responsive to the needs of laypeople wary of francis from the start conservative and traditionalist catholics were wary of francis after their beloved benedict became the first pope in 600 years to resign they grimaced when francis emerged on the loggia of st peter’s basilica after his 2013 election without the erminerimmed red velvet cape of his predecessors they gasped a few weeks later when he washed the feet of women and muslims on holy thursday a ritual previously restricted to men “we don’t like this pope” headlined italy’s conservative daily il foglio a few months into his papacy “the dictator pope” was the title of book by a british traditionalist published a few years later over time the critics’ worst fears came true one breaking point came in 2016 when francis opened the door to letting divorced and civilly remarried catholics receive communion some accused francis of heresy four conservative cardinals formally asked him to clarify himself issuing “dubia” or questions to him they argued church doctrine held that catholics who remarried without a church annulment were living in sin and couldn’t receive the sacraments he never replied reversing benedict on the latin mass conservatives could not have known that francis would take one of the most controversial steps of his pontificate by reimposing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass that benedict had relaxed the reversal of benedict’s signature liturgical legacy was evidence that francis had essentially declared war on traditionalists the ancient liturgy and benedict’s papacy itself “francis hates us francis hates tradition francis hates all that is good and beautiful” the traditionalist blog rorate caeli tweeted but it concluded “francis will die the latin mass will live forever” francis insisted his aim was to preserve church unity critics accused him of the opposite of driving a wedge and the outrage wasn’t limited to usbased conservative catholic media or fringe rightwing bloggers who had popularized francisbashing cardinal raymond burke one of the “dubia” prelates whom francis sacked early on as the vatican’s supreme court justice blasted the “severity” of the papal crackdown guinean cardinal robert sarah the vatican’s retired liturgy chief responded with tweets quoting benedict’s original 2007 law to relax the restrictions that francis had overturned they were accompanied by a photo of benedict wearing the red cape that francis had eschewed the night of his election a year earlier sarah orchestrated a media firestorm by persuading benedict to coauthor a book reaffirming priestly celibacy at a time when francis was considering ordaining married men to address a clergy shortage in the amazon the book and the prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one created the nightmare scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of in 2013 when benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement and call himself “emeritus pope” rather than revert to his birth name the scandal died down after benedict removed himself as a coauthor and francis fired his secretary archbishop georg gaenswein believed to have been behind it after benedict died and gaenswein penned his highly critical tellall memoir “nothing but the truth” francis exiled him from the vatican then after a time in his native germany made him an ambassador after burke joined a bigger group of cardinals questioning francis’ 2023 synod on the church’s future francis cut him off financially francis was more tolerant with another critic the retired archbishop of hong kong cardinal joseph zen he excoriated the pope for agreeing in 2018 to a deal with china over the nomination of bishops accusing francis of selling out china’s underground catholics who stayed loyal to the holy see during decades of persecution francis received zen at the vatican and later called him a “tender soul” francis won few friends with his frequent denunciations of “clericalism” — the idea that priests should be put on a pedestal he made it a tradition to use his christmas greeting to publicly shame vatican bureaucrats accusing them of being careerist moneygrubbing gossips with “spiritual alzheimer’s” german cardinal gerhard mueller complained that francis treated vatican monsignors like “uneducated children” a major us critic emerges francis’ biggest conservative critic was the vatican’s former ambassador to the us archbishop carlo maria vigano in 2018 he said francis had covered up accusations that thencardinal theodore mccarrick an american had slept with his seminarians vigano demanded francis resign for allegedly rehabilitating mccarrick from sanctions imposed by benedict the furor faded after francis defrocked mccarrick and vigano was discredited with conspiracy theories about covid19 mccarrick died earlier this month in 2024 francis excommunicated vigano after finding him guilty of schism papal biographer austen ivereigh said francis dismantled much of the resistance he lists the amazonian synod as a defining positive moment of his pontificate not because of the incident with the statues but because the meeting emphasized his key pastoral priority of accompanying the faithful “the native peoples of amazonia were right here in st peter’s square and francis walked across to the synod with them” ivereigh said recalling the feathered headdresses and indigenous statues that were on display “the pastor among his people walking together and i thought ‘that is him that sums him up’” he said,Recent

israel ap — whether the threat was abusive hamas guards hunger illness or israeli strikes there were moments during tal shoham’s 505 days of captivity in gaza when he didn’t think he’d be alive the next morning there were “many times that i separated from life and tried to accept death” the 40yearold israeli who also holds austrian citizenship told the associated press “there are so many ways to die there” shoham was one of dozens of hostages released from gaza in february as part of a ceasefire agreement between hamas and israel that has since been broken his wife two children and three other family members were also kidnapped on oct 7 2023 and were freed a month later shoham said he spent half his captivity in apartments and the rest in underground tunnels he was sometimes bound starved beaten and threatened with death and initially didn’t know if his family was alive after his wife was released shoham said someone identifying himself as a member of hamas called to warn her not to talk about what she’d been through or they’d kill her husband so as he recounted his own experience shoham said there were details he wouldn’t discuss fearful of endangering remaining hostages with ceasefire talks at a standstill israel is vowing to advance deeper into gaza until hamas releases the 59 hostages still there more than half of whom are believed dead the resumption of fighting has inflamed debate in israel over the course of the war and the hostages’ fate israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has come under mounting domestic pressure for his handling of the hostage crisis but he also faces demands from his hardline allies not to accept any deal that falls short of hamas’ destruction the abduction shoham was kidnapped while visiting relatives in kibbutz be’eri when hamas attacked he and his family hid in a safe room meant to offer protection from incoming rockets but as militants pried open a window and used explosives to try to break in the family surrendered a decision shoham credits with saving their lives shoham was thrown into the back of a vehicle and taken into gaza not knowing what happened to his wife or children be’eri was among the hardesthit communities that day before being separated shoham recalled telling his now 9yearold son that he didn’t know if they were going to die “i didn’t want him to hear a lie from me if it’s the last minutes of our life” he said upon entering gaza a militant jumped on the car’s roof pointed his gun at shoham and told him to kneel but shoham refused not wanting to be killed on their terms he said he said the militant had “murder in his eyes” the apartments shoham was first taken to an apartment that his captors said was in northern gaza he spent weeks there handcuffed and confined to a room about a month later he was moved to another apartment and joined by evyatar david and guy gilboadalal hostages he would spend most of his captivity with the two men were abducted from a music festival in southern israel where at least 364 people were killed and dozens more taken hostage hearing about the conditions of their captivity made shoham feel lucky about his own they’d been kept in more uncomfortable ziptie handcuffs with plastic bags on their heads he said and fed one pita per day the three lived in that apartment for months where they endured daily beatings guards would taunt and humiliate them asking how the music festival was and making shooting noises shoham said forbidden by their captors from speaking they got to know each other through furtive whispers to humanize himself in the eyes of his captors and hopefully make them less likely to kill him shoham learned arabic and talked with them about his life in israel one of their guards liked massages shoham said so the captives provided daily back rubs in exchange for more variety in their diet like tuna sardines and even eggs shoham learned his wife and children were alive about 50 days into his captivity in what he considered an act of kindness his captors gave him a letter written by his wife that said she and their children were ok and would be released soon he credits that gesture by the guards with giving him more mental strength to focus on his own survival the tunnel last june shoham david and gilboadalal were relocated to a tunnel that they estimated to be about 30 meters 98 feet underground shoham said they were moved after israel rescued four hostages from apartments in gaza earlier that month an operation that killed more than 270 palestinians they were transported in an ambulance shoham said cleanly shaved dressed in clothes meant to make him blend in and blindfolded hamas operates from civilian areas including hospitals and israel accuses hamas militants of taking cover in ambulances and other emergency vehicles the tunnels were dark and damp and it was hard to breathe shoham said the three men were kept with another hostage omer wenkert who had been in the tunnels for much longer they shared a 12meterlong 39footlong cell and slept on mattresses on the ground a meter away from a hole that was their toilet they showered roughly every 21 days shoham lost about 60 pounds 28 kilograms while in captivity he developed a leg infection that was so bad he couldn’t walk for weeks after a doctor visited and provided vitamins he said his health improved what also helped shoham survive he said was focusing on what he could control he started doing mindfulness activities he had learned from his wife a psychologist and discussed his feelings with the other hostages “the only thing that i have power upon is my inner life” he said he told himself each day that he’d eventually be free back home and healing shoham and wenkert were freed together in the last release of living hostages before the ceasefire ended the last thing shoham told david and gilboadalal was to be strong and not lose hope hamas later released a video showing the two men sitting in a nearby vehicle distressed as they were forced to watch the handover for released hostages that day a group representing hostages’ families called the video “sickening” shoham worries they’re running out of time and is urging the government and the international community not to tie the hostages’ fate to a ceasefire or a peace agreement “i really fear that if they won’t be released soon they probably will die there” he said shoham says his own healing process has been made easier by knowing his family can relate to what he endured and his freedom has helped the family properly mourn those killed on oct 7 including his wife’s father while he was in captivity they’d been so focused on his release he said since returning home shoham has gained 35 pounds 16 kilograms saying he wanted to eat everything and never felt full lately he’s been trying to get back to his precaptivity routine of intermittent fasting while his leg is still not fully healed shoham says he’s one of the lucky ones in that he’s not suffering from nightmares he credits his children with helping him keep moving forward “when i can hear my children addressing us like mother and father mom and dad saying both names

A0644,28.04.25,14,Andreeva and Gauff advance before Spain power outage halts play,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/p/x25q4t,mirra andreeva has spent the past two years of her life establishing herself as one of the most successful teenagers of her era yet on a chaotic surreal day in madrid the 17 yearold had to briefly work through playing conditions more familiar to her contemporaries on the junior circuit during the final change of ends of her fourthround match against the ukrainian qualifier yulia starodubtseva as she served for a comfortable victory she learned of the power outage that had ravaged spain portugal and many nearby countries ultimately forcing play to be postponed in madrid as matches across the tournament grounds had already come to a halt the two players were told that they could play out the subsequent game but there was a catch the live electronic line‑calling system was no longer functioning and there were no line umpires to call upon they would have to play as if they were juniors again calling their own lines with only the umpire there to intervene naturally andreeva began to feel the pressure “it was 1540 on my serve and i was like ‘oh mirra just please please do everything in your power to just take this game and finish this match’” she said laughing “i knew that if it would go to 55 probably we would have to wait probably i would not be here yet and i would just be waiting and we would just see what we would do” from double break point down andreeva pulled herself together and closed out the match a few metres away on the neighbouring stadium court her next opponent was also one of the fortunate players coco gauff had been in the middle of her post‑match interview after a dominant win when the power shut down gauff noted she had actually requested to be scheduled as the second match on‑court for once she was thankful to the wta supervisers for not honouring that request “so far the toughest thing has been not been able to shower after my match there’s no running water so i just had to take baby wipes and wipe myself spray some perfume and call it a day” gauff said an hour after her match “i don’t even think we’ll be able to go back to the hotel as the traffic lights are out so it’s just crazy how much we depend on electricity it’s really insane it puts that in perspective and also makes me think about the humans that lived before electricity and how impressive that is” 124 major power outage causes chaos in spain and portugal – video report other players were not quite as fortunate grigor dimitrov the 15th seed held a match point against britain’s jacob fearnley at 64 52 before serving for the match a game later by 54 the second set back on serve both players were walking off the court an hour later dimitrov could be found sitting down alone in the sun in a quiet outdoor spot players use to warm up smiling to himself at such an surreal turn of events “at this point this is only a situation that you can just laugh at if i was oncourt because it’s probably not going to happen ever again” gauff said “you can always remember the day the power went out at the madrid open” as much of madrid came to a standstill that chaos was reflected inside the caja mágica unlike many other tournament sites the madrid open grounds are mostly indoors below ground level and there is minimal natural light off the court it meant that much of the grounds were plunged in total darkness in the communal fan areas spectators stood shoulder to shoulder packed like sardines relying solely on the lights from their phones view image in fullscreen bulgaria’s grigor dimitrov had his match with britain’s jacob fearnley interrupted photograph thomas coexafpgetty images the players themselves had things slightly better shortly after the outage workers swept in with candles with the players’ restaurant and lounge eventually illuminated by dozens of candles every hour the player warmup area seemed to take on a completely different function shortly after the power cut a number of players due oncourt had been warming up in total darkness an hour later the room was filled with players simply lying on the floor on the phone and talking with others eventually as they admitted defeat numerous massage tables appeared and the players ended their days with physiotherapy “i was in the gym and it’s super dark everyone is using the phones with flashlights but it’s also kind of fun because everyone is talking to each other and the atmosphere is a little more friendly” andreeva said it soon became clear that there would be no more play on this unforgettable day as players scrambled to secure a lift home the line at the transport desk extended almost as long as the wimbledon queue their requests were recorded with pen and paper with traffic lights ceasing to function in the city a threehour journey awaited for those who secured a car many opted for the one‑ to two‑hour walk once they reached home this time they would not be able to distract themselves by playing video games watching tv series or doomscrolling on social media not everyone seemed to mind “if you take my phone away i’m completely

nfl draft was the dominant story of the weekend with one of college football’s most highprofile players lasting until the fifth round the fact sanders was taken by the browns two rounds after they drafted another quarterback in dillon gabriel made the entire situation even more rare the browns were the first team to draft two quarterbacks in the first five rounds of the nfl draft since washington did it in 2012 when the team traded up to take robert griffin iii with the secondoverall pick and then drafted kirk cousins in the fourth round there are only a handful of other times in the common draft era beginning in 1967 that a team picked two quarterbacks that high in the draft green bay drafted anthony dilweg in the third round and jeff graham in the fourth in 1989 the packers traded graham to washington later in the draft and he never played a game in the nfl despite spending time with several teams dilweg started seven games in 1990 the colts doubledipped at quarterback in 1982 taking art schlichter fourth overall and mike pagel in the fourth round schlichter played only 13 games because of gambling problems while pagel had a long career mostly as a backup the houston oilers also did it in 1971 taking dan pastorini in the first round and lynn dickey in the third both had long careers as starters in the nfl there were two other times it happened but one of those qbs quickly shifted positions to receiver once joining the nfl the jets took kellen clemens in the second round and brad smith in the fourth in 2006 clemens spent 12 seasons in the nfl mostly as a backup while smith had a successful career as a receiver returner and occasional wildcat quarterback the raiders took quarterbacks with their first two picks in 1968 but firstrounder eldrige dickey moved to receiver following his first training camp and had only five catches in his career secondrounder ken stabler went on to become the 1974 ap nfl mvp and had a hall of fame career as a quarterback trading up trading up for a toptwo pick in the nfl draft isn’t that uncommon with it happening five times in the last 13 drafts before this season doing it for a nonquarterback was rare the deal made by jacksonville with cleveland to move up from no 5 to no 2 to take travis hunter marked the first time since 1997 that a team traded up that high to draft a nonquarterback it happened twice in 1997 with the raiders trading up to no 2 that year before the rams jumped them two weeks later to trade for the no 1 pick the rams took hall of famer orlando pace and the raiders drafted darrell russell there hadn’t been a receiver taken in the top two since calvin johnson went second to detroit in 2007 and no defensive back had been taken that high since safety eric turner went second to cleveland in 1991 there were 12 other instances in the common draft era starting in 1967 when a team traded up for a toptwo pick and drafted a nonquarterback pace was one of four hall of famers acquired that way with the other three all being running backs eric dickerson 1983 earl campbell 1978 and tony dorsett 1977 some of the other trades weren’t as successful like cincinnati moving up to take running back kijana carter first in 1995 the jets trading up for receiver lam jones in 1980 and the vikings moving up for running back clint jones in 1967 ohio state and sec top the draft lists with the sec setting a record with 79 players drafted and ohio state having 14 of the 71 draft picks in the big ten the two most prominent college football conferences dominated draft weekend thanks to the first year of expansion that sent texas and oklahoma to the sec along with usc ucla oregon and washington joining the big ten those conferences accounted for 58 of all draft picks throw in the 42 picks for the acc and 31 for the big 12 and the four power conferences had nearly 87 of all draft picks this year along with six more from notre dame the group of five had just 18 players drafted as many players who began their careers at that level have moved up to power conferences there were only eight players chosen from nonfbs teams there were players who finished their college careers at 86 schools that got drafted with the defending champion buckeyes leading the way with 14 — one off of the record since the start of the sevenround draft era in 1994 set by georgia in 2022 the bulldogs were next with 13 followed texas with 12 oregon with 10 and ole miss with eight five schools had seven players drafted alabama florida lsu miami and michigan this marked the 87th straight draft with a player from michigan being taken usc also has had a player taken in every draft since 1939 tying the wolverines for the longest active streak position breakdown there was an even split of offensive and defensive players picked in the draft with 126 players from each side of the ball picked — not including the twoway player hunter the other four players taken were specialists including a rare long snapper drafted with julian ashby getting taken by new england with the 252nd pick the defensive line led the way with 58 players taken according to sportradar followed by 47 exclusive defensive backs and 41 offensive linemen there were 30 receivers drafted in addition to hunter along with 25 running backs 21 linebackers 16 tight ends and 14 qbs this marked just the fourth time in

A0655,01.05.25,11,Sky Glass gen 2 review: the smart streaming TV levels up,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/p/x265at,the latest version of sky’s glass smart tv is faster and looks better than its predecessor and offers a level of allinone convenience that makes the satellitefree pay tv one of the best on the market the guardian’s journalism is independent we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link learn more sky glass gen 2 is a straight replacement for the original model from 2021 which introduced sky’s tvoverbroadband service that ditched the need for a satellite dish the new tv comes in three sizes and you can buy the smallest 43in version for a oneoff payment of £699 or £14 a month spread over four years after which you own it it requires a sky subscription for full use costing from £15 a month for the sky essential tv pack you wouldn’t buy a glass without the intention of using sky but should you want to ditch the subscription at a later date it will function as a basic smart tv with access to streaming apps such as bbc iplayer plus a basic aerial and multiple hdmi inputs view image in fullscreen the gen 2 is available in a choice of three colours and comes with a colourmatched remote photograph sky uk from the front the gen 2 model looks very similar to the original it has the same monolithic design with an aluminium body slim bezels a soundbar hidden behind a colourmatched mesh at the bottom and voice control mics that respond to “hello sky” glass gen 2 is thinner and lighter than the outgoing model though still heavy for a modern tv weighing 147kg for the 43in version with the stand the larger and heavier 55in and 65in models will require two people to safely manoeuvre them a redesigned stand makes it a lot easier to set up even at the 65in size as tested with the tv simply slotting on to two prongs for a very stable mount without screws or tools required it needs a power cable and wifi or ethernet for internet a wall bracket can be bought separately view image in fullscreen the tv is voice and motionactivated turning on and off when it detects presence and displaying fullscreen recommendations for the latest shows and films photograph samuel gibbsthe guardian the crisp 4k lcd screen is noticeably brighter than its predecessor with deeper blacks and muchreduced halo or blooming effect which is the unwanted glow around the edges of bright spots such as white text on a black background the screen has automatic brightness adjustment which made things look a little too dark and grey in all but the brightest of rooms turning it off improved things sky has automatic picture optimisation modes that detect the content being watched such as entertainment sport and movies plus manual vivid and extra vivid modes for those who like overthetop colours i found the entertainment mode made the picture too warm with people looking a little orange while sport was a bit grey for all but the brightest of match days i preferred the movie setting which is much more balanced but there is also a custom mode for those who want to fully personalise the picture the improved screen really comes to life with hdr films shows and sport the premier league looks crisp and vibrant on sky and tnt while flicks such as furiosa a mad max saga in dolby vision look particularly good but the screen is not ideal for gaming with an xbox or ps5 lacking the variable refresh rates of up to 120hz that console gaming greatly benefits from big sound and great vocals view image in fullscreen the speakers fire out from the grille at the top of the tv and fabric strip below the screen photograph samuel gibbsthe guardian a big advantage of the glass over normal tvs is the integrated sevenspeaker soundbar which blows other tv speakers away for power and clarity vocals are particularly clear at almost any volume and with none of the lipsync issues that can plague external soundbars without a separate subwoofer or rear speakers it does an admirable job of producing big and full sound however it struggles to produce really deep booming bass and while it has a nice wide sound there isn’t much in the way of virtual surround effect both require a more complex system to achieve with more speakers the tv also has night sound speech enhancement and bass boost modes the first of which proved very useful to avoid waking the rest of the house for latenight movies by dampening loud noises while keeping the dialogue intelligible muchimproved sky over broadband view image in fullscreen you need a minimum of 25mbps for hd or 30mbps for uhd broadcast but don’t have to have sky’s broadband for it to work photograph samuel gibbsthe guardian since the original glass’s launch in 2021 the sky os service powering it has dramatically improved it still has excellent search and an improved playlist function with more than one user profile so everyone in the house can have their own lists and recommendations including child profiles the playlist feature automatically keeps track of new episodes of shows and films you want to watch regardless of which service they’re available from it feeds into a recently added “continue watching” rail that helps you jump straight back into the content you were previously watching which is all i needed about 75 of the time watching pausing and rewinding live tv works great recent reductions to the broadcast delay for sports have made a meaningful difference preventing the irritating scenario where a friend watching on satellite or aerial a little ahead of you texts to brag about a goal before you’ve managed to actually see it ondemand content from the sky platform works really well but a bigger improvement is in the thirdparty ondemand services such as bbc iplayer itv x and channel 4 on which you are reliant in place of recordings it’s still not quite as fast and seamless as having local recordings such as you might on sky q or other pvr but most of the apps launch quicker work better and will take you straight to the episode you want to watch from the playlist or search page it supports most of the major ondemand services including my5 youtube prime video disney paramount apple tv and discovery for all your content in one place view image in fullscreen voice control works well through the button on the remote but the tv’s wake word is a little temperamental working properly or understanding me about 60 of the time photograph samuel gibbsthe guardian sustainability the television is repairable apart from the screen it contains 22 recycled material including aluminium fabric tin and plastic the company will recycle its old products and ships the tv in plasticfree packaging price sky glass gen 2 costs £699 at 43in £949 at 55in or £1199 at 65in with 24 or 48month interestfree payment plans available for all models with a £20 upfront cost on 24month contracts sky essential tv costs from £15 a month sky ultimate tv from £22 a month and uhd dolby atmos costs an additional £6 as does the ability to skip ads other addons include sky sports from £31 a month tnt sport from £31 a month sky cinema from £13 a month and sky kids at £8 a month some discounts are available for certain combinations while all the packages can be bought on a 31day basis at different prices verdict the firstgeneration glass required work when it launched to the television screen and the sky streaming service powering it the gen 2 model rights many of the wrongs of its predecessor it is brighter faster has higher contrast and handles highlights far better it is also easily the bestsounding tv available it competes fairly well in the midrange market but you can certainly buy a betterlooking screen for similar money without a soundbar those looking for the absolute best picture should look elsewhere the sky os service has greatly improved to a level that rivals the best in the business live broadcast works just as it might over satellite or aerial ondemand content from the sky platform is as good as local recordings while the thirdparty apps such as bbc iplayer and itvx have levelled up to at least an acceptable standard the playlist and search with support for all the major streaming services are the killer features removing the burden of remembering which of the plethora of services hosts the content you want to watch above all it is the level of convenience offered by the glass gen 2 of an allin one solution with solid sound and a single remote for all your tv needs that is the major appeal pros allinone streaming and pay tv device great sound no satellitecable or aerial needed good remote excellent search and playlist functions improved apps improved picture and good hdr custom picture modes optional motionsensing and voice control cons better picture available for less from competitors some picture modes and automatic brightness control aren’t great no fast refresh rate for game consoles

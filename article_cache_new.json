The decision will come ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. Hamas said it was also intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid. Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. Earlier a senior Hamas official told the BBC that the Palestinian armed group was holding direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar. The Israeli prime minister's office said it had been informed by the US of the Hamas intention to release Alexander.\n\nA senior Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the BBC that Hamas's announcement was intended as a goodwill gesture before Trump's arrival. He said another meeting between Hamas and the mediators was scheduled for early Monday morning to finalise the process of Edan's release, which would require a temporary halt to Israeli military activity and a suspension of aerial operations during the handover. Born in Tel Aviv but raised in New Jersey, 21-year-old Alexander was serving in an elite infantry unit on the border with Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants during the 7 October attack. Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas's 2023 attack, 59 remain in the enclave, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Five of the hostages in Gaza are believed to be US citizens and Alexander was thought to be the only one still alive. In its statement, Hamas said the release was part of efforts to achieve a ceasefire and allow food, medicine and other supplies into Gaza - which has been under a complete blockade by Israel for 70 days. The group said it wanted to reach a final agreement to end the war. The Israeli prime minister's office said in a statement that it had been informed by the US of the Hamas intention to release Alexander \"as a gesture towards the Americans\" and that the move was expected to lead to negotiations on further hostages. Israel's policy was that negotiations would be conducted \"under fire, based on the commitment to achieve all of the objectives of the war\", it added. The Families and Missing Families Forum campaign group said Alexander's release \"must mark the beginning of a comprehensive agreement that will secure the freedom of all remaining hostages\". They said President Trump had \"given the families of all the hostages hope\" and urged Netanyahu to now \"bring everyone back\". Hamas has in the past said it will only agree to a deal that includes the end of the war, something that has been repeatedly rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nReuters Gaza has been under a full Israeli blockade for 70 days",

His post on X came shortly after Donald Trump demanded Ukraine agree to Putin's offer of direct talks between the two countries in Turkey. \"There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in T\u00fcrkiye on Thursday. Personally,\" Zelensky wrote. He had earlier said his country was open to talks with Russia but only after a ceasefire was in place.\n\nWestern powers called for a 30-day pause in fighting to begin on Monday after European leaders spearheading the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" met in Kyiv on Saturday. Putin's offer of direct talks followed that intervention. On Sunday Trump then posted on social media that Ukraine should agree to this \"immediately\" and it would provide clarity on whether there was a way to end the war. \"At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly\" he said, adding: \"Have the meeting, now!\" In his post on X, Zelensky said he hoped Russia would agree to the ceasefire before the talks. \"We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,\" he said. In a late-night address on Saturday, Putin invited Ukraine to take part in \"serious negotiations\" over the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Putin said he could \"not rule out\" the possibility that the talks could result in Russia and Ukraine agreeing \"a new truce\" - but did not address the calls for a 30-day ceasefire directly. The Russian leader said: \"This would be the first step towards a long-term, lasting peace, rather than a prologue to more armed hostilities after the Ukrainian armed forces get new armaments and personnel, after feverish trench-digging and the establishment of new command posts.\"\n\nEPA Vladimir Putin said the proposed talks on Thursday would be \"the first step towards a long-term, lasting peace\"",

        "title": "Care worker recruitment from abroad to end, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper says",
        "body": "Care worker recruitment from abroad to end, Cooper says\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Sam Francis Political reporter Share Save\n\nHome secretary vows 'fundamental shift' in immigration system\n\nCare workers will no longer be recruited from overseas as part of a crackdown on visas for lower-skilled workers, the home secretary has told the BBC. Yvette Cooper said it is \"time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad\" and rules will change this year - instead requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. The government plans to unveil changes to visa and recruitment laws on Monday in a bid to cut net migration, and says measures will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the plans were \"too little\" and called for an annual cap on migration.\n\nSuccessive governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration, which is the number of people coming to the UK minus the number leaving. Net migration climbed to a record 906,000 in June 2023, and last year it stood at 728,000. The Home Office has not yet officially confirmed what will be in its immigration White Paper, due early next week. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Cooper said the government \"was setting up plans for a substantial reduction in net migration\" but added targets would not be set, saying \"they undermined the credibility of anything that governments do\". The threshold for skilled visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, tightened from the current A-level measure. There will also be a \"narrower\" list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries, Cooper said, but did not give examples. Currently, roles considered to be in short supply in the UK like carpenters, graphic designers and pharmaceutical technicians can be placed on the Immigration Salary List (ISL), allowing employers to hire overseas workers at discount - set at 80% of the market rate. Cooper said the government expects those changes will \"lead to a reduction of up to 50,000 fewer lower skilled visas over the course of the next year\".\n\nAs well as visa changes, the home secretary added there would be new requirements for training commitments \"to get people who are not working back into the labour market here in the UK\". Philp - who said he agreed with the plan to end care worker recruitment from abroad - told the same programme the Conservatives would push Parliament to vote on a yearly migration cap this week. When asked what the cap would be, he said \"we're working on the detail to specify that number\", but it would be \"a further reduction of significantly more than 50,000\". He argued that if Labour had stuck with Tory changes net migration would have dropped \"by about 400,000\". Cooper also said there would be \"some changes\" to rules around international students and graduates. \"We will let them continue to come and to stay and to work afterwards,\" she added. \"We are making some changes, particularly around the standards and the compliance for universities, because, again, we've had problems where some universities haven't had proper standards in place. \"They've recruited people to come as international students who then haven't completed their courses, have either overstayed or... other problems with compliance of the system.\" The government has already tightened rules around care sector worker after coming to power last July. Applications for Health and Care Worker visas peaked at 18,300 in August 2023, then collapsed to 1,700 by April this year following the ban on bringing dependants. And on 9 April, an additional restriction was added requiring care firms who want to recruit a new worker from overseas to prove they attempted to recruit a worker from within England first. But the new rules will require care companies to recruit from domestic workers or a pool of over 10,000 care workers brought to the UK on visas for jobs that never materialised. Alongside this Cooper promised \"to bring in a new fair pay agreement for care workers\" to make care jobs more attractive to UK workers and reduce overseas demand. Nadra Ahmed, the National Care Association's executive chairman, told the BBC the changes would a \"challenging scenario\" for care homes even \"worse\". She said providers \"always prefer to have a domestic workforce\" but said it was not available.\n\nResponding to the changes, the Liberal Democrats social care spokesperson Helen Morgan said the government was \"tinkering around the edges yet failing to properly tackle the crisis in our social care\". \"Labour must step up and take proper action to address recruitment shortages including paying our care workers properly and rolling out a plan for career progression,\" she said. While Labour have been reviewing migration policy for months, many have suggested this week's crackdown was triggered by Reform UK's surge in the local elections, where it took the Runcorn and Helsby constituency off Labour and won control of 10 councils. Reform leader Nigel Farage claimed \"this new legislation is only happening because Reform is leading in the polls\". Labour's plan was \"doomed to fail\", he argued as immigration was \"not just about what numbers come in but who comes in and if they can assimilate\".",

ITV's dramatisation of the post office scandal, which led to widespread public outcry about the false convictions of sub-postmasters, was named best drama series, while ITV was given a special award to recognise the show's impact. Producer Patrick Spence said: \"This story only had the impact it did because the people that watched it stood up and demanded action with rage.\" Meanwhile, Mr Loverman, about an elderly man whose marriage falls apart after his long-term affair with his male friend is revealed, won two major acting prizes.\n\nAccepting the prize for limited series on behalf of Mr Bates vs the Post Office, Spence said the response to the show proved that the public \"cannot abide liars and bullies\". He added that \"maybe it is a warning to those who are supposed to have our backs, that they'd better not abuse that power\", and said: \"Our show didn't change the law, the people of this nation did that.\"\n\nGetty Images James Strong (centre) directed Mr Bates vs the Post Office, which starred Monica Dolan and Toby Jones\n\nManaging director of ITV Studios, Kevin Lygo, said it was \"part of a long tradition on TV of these genres that true stories that shine a light on corruption, criminality, miscarriages of justice... but nothing, I think, has had quite the effects Mr Bates has had.\" However, two of the drama's main stars Toby Jones and Monica Dolan missed out on acting prizes. Instead, best leading actress went to Industry star Marisa Abela, while best leading and supporting actor were won by Mr Loverman's Lennie James and Ariyon Bakare respectively.\n\nGetty Images Lennie James (left) and Ariyon Bakare were named best actor and supporting actor respectively for Mr Loverman\n\n\"I didn't think this was coming my way,\" said James, describing his win as a \"fantastic honour\", as he paid tribute to his fellow nominees, including David Tennant, Martin Freeman and Richard Gadd. James thanked Bernardine Evaristo, who wrote the book the series was based on. \"Thank you for trusting us with your characters,\" he said. Bakare, who played his lover, said: \"This award stands on the shoulders of those who came before me, those who might have been afraid to come out, to be who what they want to be, and I just say thank you for them.\"\n\nGetty Images Marisa Abela held off competition from Billie Piper and Anna Maxwell Martin to win leading actress\n\nAbela, who has also played Amy Winehouse in the musical biopic Back To Black, described her leading actress win as \"insane\". She noted that she was cast in the show, about a group of young finance graduates, \"when I was in my final year of drama school, and my agent who signed me in my final year is here tonight - Saskia thank you so much for believing in me\". \"I've been filming Industry for about six years now, and Bad Wolf and HBO, the fact that they let us carry on after season one, it's mental. They're the best.\"\n\nGetty Images Ruth Jones said making Gavin & Stacey had been \"an astonishing journey\"\n\nRuth Jones won best female comedy performance for her role in Gavin & Stacey: The Finale, which was broadcast at Christmas and brought the hugely popular sitcom to a close. She accepted her award in character as Nessa, beginning her speech in her alter-ego's distinctive Welsh accent and saying: \"I'm not gonna lie, this is immense. \"I've won a Bafta before, course I have, in 1976,\" she continued as Nessa. \"It was the Barry Arcade Fruit Technician Award.\" She concluded her speech - returning to herself - by thanking her \"dear, talented, lovely, kind, funny friend, James Corden, with whom I have shared this astonishing journey for the past 17 years, and without whom, Nessa Shanessa Jenkins would not exist\".\n\nThere was another Gavin & Stacey reference elsewhere in the ceremony, when host Alan Cumming asked Rob Brydon to finally answer the question of what happened on the show's notorious fishing trip. As Brydon began to speak, Cumming interrupted: \"Oh, sorry, Rob. We've got to go straight on with the next award. We'll pick it up at next year's Baftas.\"\n\nGetty Images Mr Bigstuff star Danny Dyer said he was \"choked up\" by his win for male performance in a comedy\n\nDanny Dyer won best male comedy performance for his role in Mr Bigstuff, in which he played one of two brothers with wildly different personalities who try to patch up their sibling rivalry. Dyer said he was \"choked up\" by his win, before joking: \"So my acting was so bad, it was funny?\" In an expletive-laden speech, he said it had been \"an honour to share the screen\" with his co-star Harriet Webb, and thanked writer and co-star Ryan Sampson, who he called the \"best thing to come out of Rotherham\". \"He's never done the same thing twice, which is not something I can say,\" Dyer joked. \"You wrote this part, you won this for me mate, I really appreciate it.\"\n\nBlue Lights, a police drama set in Northern Ireland, was named best drama series, Alma's Not Normal won best scripted comedy, and EastEnders was named best soap, in the year it celebrates 40 years on air. The Traitors missed out on the three prizes it was nominated for, with best reality series instead going to Channel 4's Jury: Murder Trial, which restaged a trial of murder in front of two juries of ordinary people.\n\nGetty Images Jessica Gunning's best supporting actress win marked the only prize for Netflix and Baby Reindeer\n\nBaby Reindeer star Jessica Gunning won best supporting actress, repeating her earlier wins at the Golden Globes, Emmys and SAG Awards. \"Gosh thank you Bafta, wow,\" she said. \"I sometimes do this kind of cheesy thing where I look back on the younger me and moments in my life, and I imagine the kind of then me, seeing me now, and think, 'little did we know'.\" She said she was so proud to be part of this show before saying co-star Richard Gadd \"changed my life\". She concluded by wishing him: \"Happy birthday, nipple.\"\n\nGetty Images Rylan Clark and Robert Rinder were recognised for their Italian travel series\n\nRylan Clark and Rob Rinder won the factual entertainment prize for their Italian travel series, Rob & Rylan's Grand Tour. \"We didn't know what we were making when we landed in Venice,\" reflected Clark. When he saw the programme's edit, \"I said, 'we're either going to get cancelled or we're going to win a Bafta, and I'm so glad it was the latter!\" Rinder thanked the pair's mothers, \"for allowing us to be our true selves,\" before Rylan joked: \"And BBC Arts, now we won a Bafta, can we have a bigger styling budget?\"\n\nElsewhere, Would I Lie To You? was named best entertainment programme. Panelist Lee Mack noted the show had never previously won despite being nominated eight times, and joked that Bafta's change of sponsor to P&O Cruises, which host Rob Brydon used to front adverts for, might have had an effect. \"The whiff of scandal hangs heavy in the air,\" laughed Brydon, but reassured the audience: \"I stopped those adverts five years ago, there is no connection.\"\n\nGetty Images Kirsty Wark received the Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by Bafta\n\nKirsty Wark, who left BBC Two's Newsnight last summer after 30 years, received the Bafta Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by the British Academy. Wark said it was a \"privilege and an honour\" to be recognised. \"Things have changed so much and so radically since the 70s, not least the shoulder pads, the office drinks trolley, and film crews the size of football teams, but always the chance to learn and go. \"I've been lucky to interviews politicians to painters, architects to economists, musicians and a few monsters.\" She paid tribute to her colleagues, saying: \"It takes a village to raise a programme.\"\n\nGetty Images Dianne Buswell accepted the memorable moment prize on behalf of her Strictly partner Chris McCausland",

They have been named locally as 16-year-old Emmanuel Familola, originally from Nigeria, and 18-year-old Matt Sibanda, from Zimbabwe. Hundreds of people attended the special service at St Mary's Oratory in Buncrana which was led by the Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown. He began the service by welcoming Matt and Emmanuel's family.\n\nHundreds of people attended the special service at St Mary's Convent in Buncrana\n\nBishop McKeown said there was a \"real palpable sense of gloom hanging around everybody today\". However, he said he was struck by the number of people who turned up for the service. He said the Buncrana community pulled together in the face of tragedy, which he said showed their strength, but he also highlighted their welcome of people from abroad to the local community. \"They are strong looking inwards and supporting one and another, and strong looking outwards welcoming newcomers and that's a real blessing on everybody,\" he said.\n\nDonegal TD Charlie McConalogue\n\nIrish government minister and Donegal TD, Charlie McConalogue, was among those who attended the service and said the news had come as an \"absolute shock\". \"The community came out, really really strongly for the prayers service here, to try and provide some support and comfort to their families and friends,\" he said. \"We've had our share of tragedies over the years in Inishowen and Buncrana and unfortunately it has visited two families here again.\" Mr McConalogue said he would work with the local community and liaise with the families and schools to ensure they received support.\n\nLocal resident Miriam Killeney\n\nMiriam Killeney lives in Buncrana and attended the service. She said many in the community are still in shock about the incident. \"It was such a beautiful day and suddenly we got the news, the town has suffered tragedy in the past, so for a lot of people it brought that back up again for them,\" she said. \"That is going to be something that will be very important going forward to support the children in the school and the parents.\"\n\n'No words can capture the pain'\n\nThe tragedy unfolded on Saturday afternoon after the Irish Coast Guard received a report that there were a number of people in difficulty in the water. Later that evening, an 18-year-old male's body was recovered from the water. A juvenile who was rescued from the water was taken to Letterkenny University Hospital, where he died in the early hours of Sunday morning. A third teenage boy managed to make it back to shore.\n\nThe Irish Coast Guard thanked all the search and rescue units and members of the public who assisted\n\nEvelyn McLoughlin principal of Scoil Mhuire in Buncrana, where Emmanuel attended, said there were \"no words\" that could \"fully capture the pain and sorrow that we are feeling\". \"We are truly heartbroken,\" she said. Paying tribute Ms McLoughlin added: \"Emmanuel embodied the true ethos of Scoil Mhuire, he was known for his warm personality, gentle humour and thoughtful nature. \"He immersed himself fully in our school community and was highly regarded by staff and students alike.\" She added that the school will provide support for Emmanuel's brother, who is a student there, \"through his unthinkable loss\".\n\nThe principals of Scoil Mhuire and Crana College delivered a joint statement to the media\n\nKevin Cooley, principal of Crana College, where Matt attended, added: \"As beautiful as today is, there is a dark cloud of sadness over Buncrana. \"Matt joined Crana College in January 2024, he was welcomed with open arms,\" he said. \"He was preparing for his leaving cert at the start of June. He was a determined young man, he was the most respectful young man you could ever meet. \"We share our thoughts and prayers to the families.\" Mr Cooley also thanked the emergency service for their efforts.\n\n'Difficult to witness'\n\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, local priest Fr Francis Bradley said: \"You can only imagine they [the families] are absolutely devastated. \"It's difficult to witness, but powerful to witness a mother's love, her feeling of total abandonment. \"Last night, a mother sitting cradling her son, I've looked at the Piet\u00e0, but to see it brought alive in that way is very moving. \"To hear her call out his name, even though there was no hope, to know all I could do was stand in silence in the hope that there was a good shepherd calling his name. \"Here we do not view them as immigrants or asylum seekers, to us they are parishioners.\"\n\nJoe Joyce said one of the teenagers managed to make it back ashore\n\nJoe Joyce from Lough Swilly RNLI said when they got the call they immediately launched two lifeboats. \"One of the teenagers managed to make it back ashore,\" he told BBC News NI. A former RNLI crew member, who was on the lough in his own personal boat, assisted the incident. \"He came on scene and and pulled another 16 year old out of the water. \"Around nine, half nine, we were starting to scale down the search as we lost the daylight and the Coast Guard had their drone team up. \"An object was detected in the water. That object turned out to be a person, an 18-year-old teenager. \"He was recovered by the Coast Guard to the pier in Buncrana, where a doctor on scene pronounced him dead.\"\n\nThe incident happened near Ned's Point, just outside Buncrana, at about 16:00 local time\n\n'Talented young boys'\n\nThe mayor of Inishowen, Sinn F\u00e9in's Jack Murray, told BBC News NI the community is \"devastated.\" \"On what was such a happy day, Donegal won the Ulster Championship, the Sun was shining and then that filtered through, the worst news possible that these two young men have lost their lives, it is horrendous,\" he said. Paying tribute to the two teenagers, Murray said they were \"of different nationalities from Africa, who were talented young boys\". \"It is just so sad that their lives could be cut short so tragically,\" he said. \"This is a community that has been visited by tragedy far too often,\" he added. \"I would like to think and hope that their families know that we are all thinking of them.\"\n\nAn Irish Coast Guard helicopter was involved in the search off Buncrana beach on Saturday\n\n'Integrated really well'",

President Trump's Administration is committed to full transparency\".\n\nThe White House's current fleet includes two Boeing 747-200B planes customised for presidential use with special communications equipment and features like a stateroom, office and conference room, according to the US Air Force. The planes have been in use since 1990 and 1991.\n\nAir Force One planes usually carry over to other administrations. According to the National Archives, only the Reagan presidential library has an Air Force One jet, and it flew seven presidents before being donated.\n\nQatar is said to be offering a version of a Boeing 747-8, a much newer model that ABC News reports has been upgraded into a \"flying palace\".\n\nBoeing had been contracted to provide the White House with newer planes, but Trump complained earlier this year that the company was behind schedule. His administration had initially negotiated with Boeing for two specialised 747-8 planes during his first administration.\n\nThe plane maker said the aircraft would not be available until 2027 or 2028.\n\n\"No, I'm not happy with Boeing. It takes them a long time to do, you know, Air Force One, we gave that contract out a long time ago,\" Trump said in February.\n\n\"We may buy a plane or get a plane, or something.\"\n\nTrump had a positive diplomatic relationship with Qatar during his first term, which included an announcement in 2019 that the country would make a large purchase of American airplanes.\n\nQatar has also previously given private jets as gifts to other countries, such as a luxury plane given to Turkey in 2018.",

Bessent and China's vice-premier He Lifeng have been engaged in secretive closed-door discussions all weekend, in the first meeting since US President Donald Trump levied steep tariffs against China in January. The treasury secretary did not elaborate on what had been agreed to, but said details would be announced on Monday and that Trump had been updated. On Saturday Trump praised the talks for engendering a \"total reset\" on the relationship between the two countries.\n\nIn a social media post, the US president described the talks as being \"very good\" and said change had been \"negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner\". \"We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!\" Trump added. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng also praised the \"important progress\" from the talk, and told reporters in Geneva that the meetings had been substantive, Reuters reported. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, inspector general of the World Trade Organisation, called the talks \"a significant step forward.\" \"I urge both nations to build on this momentum by continuing to develop practical solutions that mitigate tensions, restore predictability, and strengthen confidence in the multilateral trading system,\" she said in a statement. An escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing has seen the US president hit Chinese imports to the US with tariffs of 145%. China retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Washington would not lower tariffs unilaterally, and China would need to make its own concessions. Both sides issued various other warnings ahead of the meeting, with Beijing saying the US must ease tariffs while Bessent stressed that the focus was on \"de-escalation\" and this was not a \"big trade deal\". Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses. Last month, the BBC found that Chinese exporters were struggling with the US's tariffs - one company, Sorbo Technology, reported that half of its products were normally sold to the US and were now sat in boxes in a warehouse in China.

        "body": "Wrongly accused nurse 'mourning loss of career'\n\n14 hours ago Share Save Federica Bedendo BBC News, North East and Cumbria Share Save\n\nJess Thorpe Jessica Thorpe was falsely accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a patient\n\nA nurse who was falsely accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a mental health patient says she is in \"mourning\" for her lost career. Jessica Thorpe, from Newcastle, was working as a nurse for the Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust when she was suspended after a patient claimed she was pregnant with his child. This week an employment tribunal ruled she was entitled to \u00a323,500 compensation from the trust, which said it was disappointed with the constructive dismissal ruling. \"Nursing is not something that you get into for that pay cheque at all - it's about your character and who you are as a person,\" Miss Thorpe said.\n\n\"I feel like I'm mourning the loss of my career.\" Miss Thorpe joined the trust in 2016 and was carrying out a nursing apprenticeship with Sunderland University when the allegations surfaced in 2020. In the five years which ended with the tribunal proceedings, the nurse fought to clear her name. \"I feel like the last five years have been incredibly claustrophobic. \"I've used things like social media to distract me from that and pretend that it's not happening. \"But now that it's all over, I feel like I can really breathe again and carry on with my life.\"\n\nJess Thorpe Miss Thorpe joined the trust in 2016\n\nAfter her suspension, the 31-year-old started an Instagram and YouTube profile which became so popular she made enough money from her posts to enable her to pay the bills after leaving nursing. \"Social media was a complete accident for me,\" she said. \"It never was meant to turn into what it has, it was never something that I thought: 'I'm going to make money from this, I'm going to change my career'. \"It was a total distraction to me, it took me away from the reality of what was going on in my life.\"\n\nMiss Thorpe said she was the first to flag issues with the patient when he told her he believed she was pregnant and that the baby was his. She reported it to the nurse in charge of the mental health unit where she worked and included what he had said in his patient's notes. But, a few weeks later, when he made the same allegation to another member of staff, Miss Thorpe was suspended pending an investigation. \"I honestly felt a bit sick - I couldn't believe that it had actually escalated this far, considering I had already raised concerns,\" she said. \"I don't disagree with being suspended. It's just the way that they dealt with it afterwards.\"\n\nJess Thorpe The trust suspended Miss Thorpe after the allegations came to light\n\nMiss Thorpe faced a disciplinary hearing and the allegation against her was not upheld. However, the patient later died and a separate investigation was launched, as a result of which Miss Thorpe was kept off work for a total of two years. When she was eventually told she could return to work, she felt her reputation had been tainted and she was not getting the support she was hoping for from the trust, so she resigned. Lynne Shaw, executive director of workforce at the trust, said they had put measures in place for Miss Thorpe's return, including a return-to-work plan and mentor. \"However, Ms Thorpe decided to end her employment with the trust.\"\n\nMiss Thorpe sued the trust for constructive unfair dismissal, unlawful deduction of wages and breach of contract, and won on all three counts. \"I thought, if I take them to tribunal then I can actually officially clear my name and say to them you can't treat people this way.\"\n\nJess Thorpe The trust said it was disappointed with the outcome of the tribunal decision\n\nMiss Thorpe said the tribunal process was not just very difficult but also very costly, and she was concerned about the wider impact on the NHS. \"We always hear that the NHS has got no money and they're struggling for nurses, but they're literally haemorrhaging money on cases like mine,\" she said. \"Lengthy suspensions are so expensive. Why is it that this is what taxpayers are spending their money on when it should be on care?\" Ms Shaw said the trust was disappointed with the outcome of the tribunal but \"respect its findings and will look at what lessons can be learned\".\n\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.",

But that's not all the week has in store. Final Destination Bloodlines hits cinemas, Doom: The Dark Ages is released, and the second series of Inside Our Minds is out on BBC Two. Read on for what's coming up this week...\n\nIt's that time again... Eurovision is back\n\nGetty Images\n\nSkimpy costumes, wacky performances and furious flag-waving... it can only be Eurovision. This year's song contest is taking place in Basel, Switzerland. All-female trio Remember Monday, made up of Lauren Byrne, Holly Anne-Hull, and Charlotte Steel, will represent the UK with their song What The Hell Just Happened. It's a quirky, catchy girls-together anthem \u2013 and the biggest creative risk the UK has taken at Eurovision for years, writes my colleague Mark Savage. But will it be enough to push us up the Eurovision rankings? Well - it's not long to find out. The grand final will take place on Saturday, hosted by Graham Norton and streaming live on BBC One and iPlayer. Right before the final, Norton is also starring in a new episode of Doctor Who, taking his Eurovision commentary duties to an Interstellar Song Contest.\n\nAnother Final Destination hits cinemas\n\nThis week, prepare to be scared as Final Destination Bloodlines is released in cinemas. It's the sixth film in the horror franchise, which first came out in 2000 - and you can expect it to follow a similar premise of people cheating death, only to find death coming after them. In Bloodlines, a college student - haunted by a recurring nightmare - tries to find a way to end the cycle, and therefore to save her family from an untimely demise. After so many instalments, the challenge for filmmakers includes creating new and different death sequences that we haven't seen before. But early reactions on social media have been positive by those who've watched it. \"The kills are glorious and inventive and shows that this concept still works well for movies,\" said That Hashtag Show's Hunter Bolding. The AU Review's Peter Gray described it as \"amusingly gory and self aware,\" adding: \"Fans will eat this up! Big, bloody, fun!\"\n\nChris Packham goes Inside Our Minds\n\nBBC Studios\n\nFollowing his series Inside Our Autistic Minds, presenter and naturalist Chris Packham is back with a second series of Inside Our Minds to explore what it's like to live inside attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Over two episodes, Chris will meet four contributors who will reveal to their friends and family how they really feel inside, and what ADHD or dyslexia mean for them. Speaking ahead of their release, he told Radio Times that people who call ADHD a \"fad\" are \"prejudiced\". \"That very urgently needs countering in this time of divisive culture wars, with assaults on inclusivity and diversity,\" the Springwatch presenter, 64, said. Inside Our Minds starts on Monday at 9pm, on BBC Two and iPlayer.\n\nDoom gets Medieval on us\n\nBy Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter\n\nThere's a joke among software developers whenever a piece of new, questionably useful tech is launched (smart fridges, anyone?) Can it run Doom? The answer is usually \"yes\" \u2013 the 1993 classic has been made to work on microwaves, treadmills and even medical equipment. But you might need a bit more processing power for Doom: The Dark Ages, out on PS5, Xbox and PC from Thursday. Following up 2020's Doom: Eternal, The Dark Ages plunges player character the Doom Slayer into a Medieval hellscape filled with demonic enemies and an arsenal of frankly ridiculous weapons. So far, so Doom. But early previews suggest the latest entry in the series is something of a departure, featuring larger open areas to explore, a heavier focus on storyline and gameplay that encourages players to think defensively (when they aren't pelting enemies with streams of projectiles). Having said that, players can also equip themselves with a shield lined with chainsaw blades, pilot a Godzilla-sized giant robot and ride a dragon \u2013 all to a heavy metal soundtrack, of course. And it doesn't get much more Doom than that.\n\nOther highlights this week",

        "body": "One of Alcatraz's last living inmates on Trump's plan to reopen prison\n\n20 hours ago Share Save Madeline Halpert BBC News, New York Lily Jamali BBC News, Alcatraz Island Share Save\n\nDaniel A. Edwards Hopkins has moved back to his home state of Florida since he was released in 1963\n\nWhen Charlie Hopkins thinks back to the three years he spent in one of America's most famous prisons, he remembers the \"deathly quiet\" the most. In 1955, Hopkins was sent to Alcatraz - a famed prison on an isolated island off the coast of San Francisco - after causing trouble at other prisons to serve a 17-year sentence for kidnapping and robbery. Falling asleep at night in his cell on the remote island, he said, the only sound was the whistle of ships passing. \"That's a lonely sound,\" Hopkins said. \"It reminds you of Hank Williams singing that song, 'I'm so lonesome I could cry.'\" Now 93 and living in Florida, Hopkins said the San Francisco National Archives informed him that he is likely the last surviving former Alcatraz inmate. Another former inmate, William Baker, appeared to be alive as of last year.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC this week, Hopkins described life at Alcatraz - which formed the setting for the 1996 film The Rock - where he made friends with gangsters and once helped plan an unsuccessful escape. Although it closed decades ago, US President Donald Trump recently claimed that he wants to re-open it as a federal prison. When Hopkins was transferred to the high-security prison in 1955, from an Atlanta facility, he remembers it being clean, but barren. And there were few distractions - no radio at the time, and few books, he said. \"There was nothing to do,\" he said. \"You could walk back and forth in your cell or do push-ups.\" Hopkins kept busy part of the time with his job cleaning Alcatraz, sweeping the floors and buffing them \"until they shined\", he said. He was sent to prison in 1952 in Jacksonville, Florida, for his role in a series of robberies and kidnappings. He was part of a group that took hostages to get through roadblocks and steal cars, he said. The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon\n\nNational Archives Charlie Hopkins spent three years in Alcatraz prison after causing trouble in other facilities\n\nAt Alcatraz, Hopkins had some infamous neighbours. The facility housed many violent criminals over its 30 years - Al Capone; Robert Stroud, a murderer known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\"; and crime boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger - making it the subject of a host of films and television shows. A 22-acre island, 1.25 miles (2km) off San Francisco and surrounded by freezing waters with strong currents, Alcatraz was originally a naval defence fort. It was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison. The US Justice Department took it over in the 1930s, transforming the facility into a federal prison to address rampant organised crime at the time. Even in the high-security prison, Hopkins said he still managed to get into trouble and spent many days in the facility's \"D Block\" - solitary confinement where inmates who misbehaved were held and rarely let out of their cells. His longest stint there - six months - came after he tried to help several other prisoners, including notorious bank robber Forrest Tucker, escape Alcatraz, Hopkins said. He helped steal hacksaw blades from the prison's electric shop to cut the prison bars in the basement kitchen. The plan didn't work - prison guards discovered the blades in other inmates' cells, Hopkins said. \"A few days after they locked them up, they locked me up,\" he said. But that did not stop one of the inmates. In 1956, when Tucker was taken to a hospital for a kidney operation, he stabbed his ankle with a pencil so prison guards would have to remove his leg irons, Tucker told the New Yorker. Then, as he was taken to get an X-ray, he overpowered hospital orderlies and ran away, he said. He was captured in a hospital gown in a cornfield hours later. As more prisoners attempted to escape Alcatraz over the years, officials ramped up security, Hopkins said. \"When I left there in 1958, the security was so tight you couldn't breathe,\" he said. All told, there were 14 separate attempts over the years involving 36 inmates, according to the National Park Service. One of the most famous involved Frank Morris, and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, who escaped in June 1962 by placing papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads in their beds and breaking out through ventilation ducts. They were never found, but the FBI concluded that they drowned in the cold waters surrounding the island.\n\nA year later, the prison shut down after the government determined it would be more cost-effective to build new prisons than to keep the remote island facility in operation. Now it's a publicly run museum visited by millions each year that generates about $60m (\u00a345m) a year in revenue for park partners. The building is decrepit, with peeling paint, rusted pipes, and crumbling toilets in each cramped cell. Construction on the main prison facility began in 1907, and more than a century of exposure to the elements has rendered the place all but uninhabitable. Trump said this week, however, that he wants his government to re-open and expand the island prison for the country's \"most ruthless and violent offenders\".\n\nA tour group visits Alcatraz",

        "body": "Swiss host city Basel promises 'everyone is welcome' at Eurovision\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Imogen Foulkes Reporting from Basel Share Save\n\nTIL BUERGY/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Executive head of production Tobias Aberg is preparing St. Jakobshalle in Basel for the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest\n\nThe Swiss city of Basel is going into party mode this weekend, as it prepares to welcome the Eurovision Song Contest. It's been 36 years since Switzerland last hosted the contest, after Celine Dion won in 1988, so the wait to roll out Eurovision's famous turquoise carpet has been long. Switzerland hosted the first ever Eurovision at Lugano in 1956, but its record since Dion's victory in Dublin has been mixed. Between 2007 and 2010, and again between 2015 and 2018, its entries failed to even qualify for the final. Swiss singer Nemo finally won last year with The Code.\n\nEBU The Swiss broadcaster, SRGSSR, has put up posters emphasising unity\n\nPerhaps because of that, Basel is determined to make this contest memorable for all the right reasons. At 1.3km (0.8 miles), its turquoise carpet will be Eurovision's longest ever, stretching from Basel town hall, across the river Rhine all the way to the Eurovision village. The head of Basel's government, Conradin Cramer, believes his city of just 175,000 residents is the natural home for Eurovision's estimated half a million visitors. Because of its borders with both France and Germany, Basel is \"the heart of Europe\", he says. What's more, he points out, the city has a long humanist tradition; when other cities in medieval Europe were cracking down on free thinkers, Basel welcomed them. So Basel, with its geographic location and its history of tolerance, and Eurovision with its tradition of inclusivity and diversity are, he says \"the perfect match\".\n\nLast year's contest in Malmo attracted thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators and further protests against the war in Gaza are expected in Basel too. Police have not yet released their plans to manage this, but have said that everyone should have the right to express their opinion, as long they stay within the law, and do not risk the safety of others. Throughout the contest they say 1,300 officers will be on duty. Basel has also unveiled a security operation to ensure visitors can enjoy the song contest safely. They are promising \"mobile awareness teams\", safe retreats for victims of violence or hostility and a 24-hour hotline. The concept, which Basel officials describe as unique, aims to prevent violence, sexual assault or harassment, and racist aggression and insults. The awareness teams, recognisable by their pink jackets, will be available 24 hours a day across the city. Basel's security director Stephanie Eymann said the teams were a \"low-threshold\" measure to give visitors a chance to report harassment or assaults, and seek protection, even if some might not want to approach the police. The entire town appears to have embraced the event, with turquoise welcome flags now waving from every lamp post. Tickets for the contest itself sold out in minutes, but Basel is promising that there will be \"something for everyone\", ticket or no ticket, and most of it will be free. \"There will be concerts all over the city, there will be art projects,\" says tourism director Letizia Elia. Basel has 40 museums and galleries in a space of just 37 square kilometres, a record for a European city, and they are all getting involved. An exhibition featuring works by Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko, Wassily Kandinsky, and Pablo Picasso has opened at the Beyeler Foundation, where Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone's We are Poems rainbow sculpture sits on the roof. There's also a Glitz and Glam exhibition at Basel's museum of natural history. The celebrations have spread across Switzerland, with competitions across the country for the best school band \u2013 the top four will get a spot on stage in Basel.\n\nHead of Basel's government, Conradin Cramer, Raphael Bouvier, curator of the Beyeler foundation, Basel tourism director Letizia Elia. Diana Segantini, of ESC's public value section present an exhibition on Eurovision\n\nBut hosting an event like Eurovision is never hitch-free, and this one is no exception. The final choice of Basel as a venue was only made at the end of August last year, allowing just over seven months to organise everything. Then came objections from evangelical Christian groups, who claimed Eurovision undermined traditional family values and that performers regularly sang about satanism and the occult. They gathered enough signatures to force a referendum aimed at banning public money for the event. But on 24 November voters gave a huge yes to the song contest; with 66.6% approving Basel's budget of almost $40m. Conradin Cramer had expected a referendum, because \"that's how Switzerland works, it's perfectly fine.\" But he was still delighted at the size of the vote in favour: \"It shows this is a city where people really want to do this.\" He is very conscious that the global debate around diversity and inclusion has changed in the year since Swiss singer Nemo became the first non-binary person to win Eurovision. The overriding message of Basel, Mr Cramer says, is \"everyone is welcome\".\n\nReuters Last year's winner Nemo was greeted by fans offering non-binary flags upon their return to Switzerland",

Reflecting on current conflicts, the newly selected pontiff called for a \"lasting peace\" in the war in Ukraine, a ceasefire in Gaza, and welcomed Saturday's agreement to end recent hostilities between India and Pakistan. He said he was \"deeply hurt\" by events in Gaza, expressed hope for a \"lasting accord\" between India and Pakistan, and wished for a \"authentic, true and lasting peace\" in Ukraine. The Pope also recited the Regina Caeli prayer, in honour of the Virgin Mary, to the crowd in St Peter's Square.\n\nPope Leo was chosen as the new leader of the Catholic Church on Thursday following the death of his predecessor, Pope Francis, and a two-day conclave in Vatican City. On Saturday, he visited a shrine outside Rome before praying at Francis' tomb inside the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. Pope Leo will be formally inaugurated at a Mass in St Peter's Square next week on 18 May. Three years ago, as Bishop Robert Prevost, he denounced Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine as an imperialist war and condemned crimes against humanity he said were being committed there. On Sunday, he restricted himself to echoing his predecessor, Francis, in calling for peace. \"I would also like to address the powerful people of the world, repeating the always current call: 'no more war',\" he told the crowd from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica. \"The immense tragedy of the Second World War ended 80 years ago...now we're facing the tragedy of a third world war in pieces.\"\n\nGetty Images Reuters Pope Leo called for a \"lasting peace\" in the war in Ukraine and said he was \"deeply hurt\" by events in Gaza A large crowd gathered to hear Pope Leo's first Sunday address\n\nThe pontiff continued: \"I carry in my heart the suffering of the beloved Ukrainian people. \"May whatever is possible be done to reach an authentic, true and lasting peace as quickly as possible. May all the prisoners be freed. May children return to their families. \"And I am deeply hurt by what is happening in the Gaza Strip. \"May a ceasefire immediately come into effect. May humanitarian aid be allowed into the civilian population and may all hostages be freed.\" He added: \"I was happy to hear on the other hand that there was a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, and I hope that through the coming negotiations we might soon come to a lasting accord.\" His remarks came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin set out competing plans for a peace process to bring the three-year invasion of Ukraine to an end. In the Middle East, Israel has cut off all humanitarian aid entering Gaza and resumed its military offensive in the Palestinian territory following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement. Meanwhile, India and Pakistan agreed to a tentative ceasefire on Saturday after days of cross-border military strikes that followed an attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir on 22 April. It has been a busy week for the pontiff, who held his first Mass as Pope in the Sistine chapel on Friday before speaking to cardinals on Saturday.\n\nReuters Pope Leo prayed before the simple white marble tomb of his predecessor on Saturday\n\nDuring this meeting, he described himself as an unworthy choice for Pope, and vowed to continue the \"precious legacy\" of his predecessor. He highlighted the importance of missionary work and discussion - as well as care for those he called the \"least and the rejected\". He explained he had chosen the name Leo after a 19th-century Pope known for his teaching on social justice. The new Pope also suggested the development of artificial intelligence and other advances meant the church was necessary today for the defence of human dignity and justice.",

US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said the discussions in Muscat were encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described them as \"difficult but useful\". The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons, but Tehran denies it has such an aim and on Sunday again stressed it did not intend to give up the programme. Donald Trump pulled out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and five other world powers in 2018.\n\nHe previously warned of possible military action against Iran's nuclear facilities if the fresh set of talks, which began in April, do not succeed. Two previous rounds of the negotiations were held in Muscat with one taking place in the Omani embassy in Rome. A senior US official said the latest discussions lasted more than three hours, adding: \"Agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements. \"We are encouraged by today's outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future.\" Speaking to Iranian state TV, Araghchi said the talks had been \"more serious and more direct\" than on previous occasions. \"The two sides have now a better understanding of each other's positions. We can characterise the talks today as moving forward.\" But Araghchi said \"contradictory positions taken by the US in the media is not acceptable to us as they do not help the negotiations\". The talks came in the same week that Witkoff said in an interview with US media outlet Breitbart News that the US expects Iran to dismantle its uranium enrichment activities. Araghchi said: \"Enrichment is an issue that Iran will not give up and there is no room for compromise on it. However, its dimensions, levels, or amounts might change for a period to allow confidence-building.\"",

        "body": "How backchannels and US mediators pulled India and Pakistan back from the brink\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Soutik Biswas and Vikas Pandey BBC News Reporting from Delhi Share Save\n\nReuters Crowds gathered in Islamabad after the ceasefire announcement\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\". Behind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say. However, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility. India accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing \"responsibility and restraint.\" Before Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict. After a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir - triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases. The rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.\n\nGetty Images US Secretary of State Marco Rubio (left) and President Donald Trump\n\nTanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May \"might have been the crucial point\". \"There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,\" she says. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US. \"One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,\" Ms Madan says. This isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an India\u2013Pakistan crisis. In his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.\n\nReuters Kashmiri men greeted each other after the ceasefire announcement in Srinagar\n\nFormer Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict. But diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time. \"The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday. Yet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish. As tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's \"fundamentally none of our business\". \"We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, \" he said in a television interview. Meanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: \"I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now\".\n\nGetty Images Pakistani people celebrated after the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, in Hyderabad, Sindh province\n\nEjaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions. \"The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,\" Mr Haider told the BBC. Experts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang. The NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons. This was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in. \"The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,\" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC. What also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.",

        "body": "Freed British-Israeli hostage 'so happy' to be in UK\n\n7 hours ago Share Save Lucy Manning Special correspondent Share Save\n\nEmily Damari: \"May the 59 hostages be home soon\"\n\nFormer British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari has told BBC News she is \"so happy\" to be in the UK and is thankful to those here who campaigned for her release from Gaza. The 28-year-old was released from Hamas captivity after being held for more than 15 months after she was kidnapped from her home in southern Israel on 7 October 2023. Ms Damari, who is visiting the UK for the first time since her release in January, said she was happy to be \"home finally\", as she was surrounded by supporters outside Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. \"Thank you to everyone for praying for me, and shouting my name without knowing me. I don't really have the words to say how thankful I am for that,\" she told the crowd.\n\n\"I'm home finally, and with you it's more than a home. It's like a family,\" she said, adding with a smile that she hopes Spurs will win today. Some 59 hostages remain in Gaza, with about 21 thought to still be alive. \"They need to bring the hostages back now. It's not something to talk about, they just need to bring them home,\" Ms Damari told the BBC. Later she said that at times she never thought she would make it back to the UK and that she was thankful to everyone in Britain who campaigned for her and her mother Mandy, originally from South London, who led efforts to get her released. Dressed in a Spurs shirt, Ms Damari hugged her mum, who said: \"I'm so glad she's back and so glad she's here with people who supported her all the time.\" The British-Israeli national was shot in the leg and hand when she was dragged from her home on Kinbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October. Hamas also shot and killed her dog. She was taken from the safe room of her house with her friends Ziv and Gali Berman. The 27-year-old twins are still being held by Hamas and Ms Damari said she is doing all she can to get them and the other 59 hostages - not all of them alive - back to their families in Israel.\n\nEmily pictured with Tottenham Hotspur footballer James Maddison\n\nEarlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said while they had believed 24 hostages were still alive, there was now uncertainty about the fate of three of them. Outside the stadium, Ms Damari held a banner showing her two friends and told the crowd: \"May the 59 hostages be home soon. Gali and Ziv Berman are very, very close friends of mine, and I hope they bring him home. Today.\" Her mother Mandy said: \"We need all the 59 hostages back. Gali and Ziv are Emily's friends and it's so important to all the families that the hostages in Gaza have to come back.\" During the Hamas attack, Ms Damari lost two of her fingers and did not receive proper medical treatment while being held. But her injured hand gesture that she flashed on her release has been seen as a symbol of defiance and resilience in Israel, appearing on posters, t-shirts and memes across the country.",

There will be no flowers handed out at Stamford Bridge for winning Europe's third-tier tournament.\n\nFor a club of Chelsea's ambition, not to mention vast financial outlay, the Champions League is what matters. That is where the club believes it should be.\n\nThe Blues are still clinging on to the final Champions League spot with two matches remaining but, with just a point separating them and seventh, it is far too close for comfort.\n\nAnd the 2-0 loss on Tyneside places a heavy load on their final two games at home to Manchester United, then, with great significance as they are chasing the same lucrative prize, away to seventh-placed Nottingham Forest on the last day.\n\nIf Chelsea win the Conference League but do not qualify for the Champions League, Maresca must expect this season to be judged as failure, however harsh that judgement may seem.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher, not least for Maresca, who has had a somewhat loveless relationship with Chelsea fans never fully convinced by the studied passing style which is his trademark.\n\nThis defeat means Chelsea have lost six of their last nine away games in the Premier League, winning one and drawing two. Since Christmas Day, only Leicester City and Southampton (both four) have picked up fewer away points in the competition than Chelsea's five.\n\nIt is a flaw that has brought Chelsea to the point where the success of their season hangs in a delicate balance.\n\nAnd all this makes the act of wild indiscipline from striker Nicolas Jackson after 35 minutes at St. James' Park, with Chelsea already trailing to Sandro Tonali's early goal, not only reckless but potentially very expensive.\n\nOnly Jackson can explain what possessed him to launch himself forearm first into the face of Newcastle defender Sven Botman, a red card the inevitable outcome once referee John Brooks was directed towards the screen by the Video Assistant Referee.\n\nJackson not only left Chelsea short-handed at Newcastle, he will now miss those pivotal final games that could shape so many futures at Stamford Bridge.

Days of cross-border military strikes had preceded the US-brokered deal, marking the worst military confrontation between the two rivals in decades.

Pakistan denies any involvement. US President Donald Trump announced the \"full and immediate\" ceasefire on his Truth Social Platform on Saturday. He said it had been brokered by the US. Pakistan's foreign minister later confirmed the agreement had been reached by the two countries, adding that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy. But hours after the announcement, residents - and BBC reporters - in the main Indian-administered Kashmiri cities of Srinagar and Jammu reported hearing explosions and seeing flashes in the sky. Indian Foreign Secretary Misri accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" of the deal, and said his country's armed forces would give \"an appropriate response\".

        "body": "BBC team's tense encounter with sanctioned Israeli settler while filming in West Bank\n\nJust now Share Save Fergal Keane & Alice Doyard BBC News Reporting from Jordan Valley Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nDust was rising on the track. It hung in the hot midday air as the white jeep came towards us. The driver was less than a minute away. \"I think it's Moshe Sharvit,\" said Gil Alexander, 72, a devout religious Jew who tries to protect Palestinian shepherds from intimidation by Jewish settlers. Over the last year we've been documenting his work with shepherds in the northern Jordan Valley, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The man approaching us was placed under sanctions by Britain and the EU last year after they said he had used \"physical aggression, threatened families at gunpoint, and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace Palestinian communities\". In a case reported by our colleagues at BBC Eye Investigates last year, a Palestinian grandmother alleged that Moshe Sharvit had forced her to leave her family home in October 2023. Ayesha Shtayyeh also said he pointed a gun at her head and threatened to kill her.\n\n\"We've been here for 50 years\u2026What have I ever done to him?\" she asked when BBC Eye interviewed her. She said her family's troubles began after Moshe Sharvit established a so-called 'outpost'- a settlement that is illegal under both Israeli and international law - chasing away the family's sheep, damaging property and constantly threatening them. The alleged incident with the gun was the final straw. Moshe Sharvit did not respond to BBC Eye's requests for a response to Ayesha's account. Back on the mountainside, the man accused of this violence stopped his car and approached us. Nodding towards Gil Alexander he asked us: \"Do you know he's a very dangerous guy?\" When our translator explained to Moshe Sharvit we were from the BBC he said: \"Ah the BBC\u2026 great lovers of Israel\u2026\" He went on to call us bad and dangerous people. Addressing our translator he said: \"So, do you understand that they're the people who are most dangerous to the State of Israel?\" Then he phoned the police, asking them to come to the scene. When he wasn't calling the police he filmed us filming him. Moshe Sharvit and Gil Alexander represent starkly different visions of Israel's future. While Moshe Sharvit believes all of the West Bank - which settlers and the Israeli government call Judea and Samaria - were given by God to the Jews. In this he is supported by senior ministers in the government, including the Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and the Minister of Public Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir. Both men are settlers and leaders of far-right ultranationalist parties.\n\nAyesha Shtayyeh alleges Moshe Sharvit threatened her with a gun and told her to leave her home of 50 years\n\nSmotrich has said Gaza will be \"totally destroyed\" and that its people will be \"totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places\". The 'other places' he envisages are foreign countries. Ben-Gvir, who is responsible for the police, has convictions for inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organisation. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, relies on the support of the far-right settler movement to keep his government in power. He criticised the sanctions imposed on Moshe Sharvit and other settlers, saying his government viewed the move \"with great severity\". US sanctions against Moshe Sharvit were dropped when President Donald Trump came to power. The UN's top court ruled last year that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is against international law and that all settlement activity is illegal. Israel rejects this and argues that settlements are necessary for security, citing lethal attacks by Palestinian gunmen on settlers, such as the killing of three people last January in the West Bank.\n\nGil Alexander (left) and Moshe Sharvit both phoned the police\n\nSettlement expansion is anathema to Gil Alexander. He considers himself a Zionist, but within the existing borders of Israel. These are the frontiers that existed before it seized the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war, after neighbouring Arab countries launched a surprise attack. He is part of a network called the Jordan Valley Activists \u2013 Moshe Sharvit calls them \"anarchists\" - offering solidarity, and working for peaceful co-existence with the Palestinians. \"What they [the settlers] want to see happen,\" Gil Alexander told us, \"[is] that it will be an area completely free of Arabs. It isn't Moshe. It's all the people above him who sent him here. Meaning from the top\". Moshe Sharvit's desire to have the Jordan Valley empty of Palestinians is shared by the leader of the regional council, a government-supported body, David Elhayani, who has visited the sanctioned settler. In his air conditioned office about 15km (9 miles) from Moshe Sharvit's settler outpost he told us \"the notion of settler violence is an invention of the anarchist, extreme left meant to harm the settlement image\". As for the future of the Palestinians, he was emphatic. They should go to neighbouring Jordan. \"This country needs to be free of Arabs. It's the only way. It's a global interest. Why global? Because the minute there won't be Arabs here it will be a Jewish nation for the Jews who won't have to hurt each other, there won't be conflict, there won't be anything.\"\n\nGil Alexander, who describes himself as a Zionist, believes Israeli territory should end at the 1967 borders\n\nGil Alexander and Moshe Sharvit have a history of antagonism. During an altercation on a Palestinian farmer's land in January 2023, Moshe Sharvit says Gil Alexander tried to seize his firearm from its holster. While speaking to our translator he produced a video of the incident on his phone. \"You can see Gil Alexander. Same hat and glasses. That's me. Here you see he grabs my gun.\" Gil Alexander says he was acting in self-defence after Moshe Sharvit had grabbed his walking stick, and the phone of his friend and violently pushing it. He says he feared Moshe Sharvit was going to use the weapon. As a result, Moshe Sharvit got a restraining order which forbids Gil Alexander from being within 2.5km (1.5 miles) of his farm. The police have charged Gil Alexander with illegal possession of a weapon (the one he allegedly tried to take from Moshe Sharvit) and assault. The issue will be considered by the Israeli courts. Moshe Sharvit himself is the subject of a restraining order forbidding him to approach a Palestinian family living near his outpost for six months, since March this year. During our encounter the settler claimed that Gil Alexander had breached his restraining order by taking us to the high ground overlooking the valley. The peace activist told us later that he had mistakenly strayed just over half a kilometre inside the area of the order. Although Moshe Sharvit's settlement is illegal, even under Israeli law, it has not been removed. Human rights organisations and numerous eyewitnesses testify that the Israeli army and police frequently stand by while settlers attack Palestinian villages. The violence has escalated sharply since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped, and which triggered the Gaza war.\n\nMoshe Sharvit approached, blocked the road and phoned the police\n\nAccording to a report issued by the UN office for Humanitarian Affairs there were 1,804 attacks by settlers against Palestinians in the period January 2024 to March 2025. The Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din (There is Law), reported that only 3% of complaints made against settlers resulted in a conviction. In six days last month - from 22 to 28 April - the UN recorded 14 incidents involving settlers that left 36 Palestinians injured. In the tense atmosphere on the mountainside, and wanting to avoid any escalation, we decided to leave. As we walked away, Moshe Sharvit went to his jeep and drove ahead of us, stopping where the track turned down the mountain. Our way out was blocked. There was no-one we could appeal to apart from the man preventing us from leaving. Again, he phoned the police asking them to come. Gil Alexander phoned the police and his lawyer. Our team was worried that more settlers would come. Then something surprising happened. I suggested to Moshe Sharvit that he should agree to be interviewed. After a brief pause, he said: \"Bring the camera.\" What followed was less an interview, than a series of declarations. He was doing the work of God, he said. Why did local Bedouin shepherds say they were very afraid of him? I asked. \"No, that is a lie. They're telling stories so the world will think we're crazy. It's not true. It's all lies that are built on lies of dozens of years of lying\u2026\" he said. \"The Arabs, since the formation of the country and before - all the past 77 years they've been preoccupied with harming the people of Israel, harming the land of Israel and causing the nation of Israel to be miserable and pitiful. But they don't understand that the harder they try, the Lion will wake from his sleep and within one day we'll end this story.\"\n\nHe repeated the analogy of the Lion later in the interview saying, in what sounded like ominous words, that the Palestinians were \"pushing the lion so hard into the corner that there will be no choice left but to finish this story\". \"7 October was small. One day it'll be big.\" As for peaceful co-existence such as Gil Alexander supports, he said there was \"no such thing as peace with enemies who try to destroy you\". Moshe Sharvit's brother Harel was killed fighting in Gaza in December 2023. His world is the pastureland, the stony hills of the Jordan Valley, his sheep and cattle, the bed and breakfast he has opened. He produced a glossy video, replete with a backing track of American country music, to promote his venture. He spoke with contempt for the British sanctions against him. They were a new kind of antisemitism, he claimed. \"The minute someone tries to hurt me I get stronger. My spirit\u2026I receive energies, my spirit continues on its mission, I continue advancing forward and planting roots deep into the land of Israel. I'm not bothered by Britain or America or anyone.\"\n\nMoshe Sharvit agreed to be interviewed\n\nThen he drove away. We were free to move on. Later as we were having lunch in a caf\u00e9 about 15km (nine miles) away, a policeman appeared, looking for Gil Alexander. He went with the police officer for questioning. After about an hour he returned, telling us he had been ordered not to enter the Jordan Valley for two weeks. He plans to lodge his own complaint against Moshe Sharvit over the incident. We went to Gil Alexander's home in a kibbutz inside Israel that overlooks the Valley. Gunmen from the Palestinian city of Jenin fired at the kibbutz two years ago. Gil Alexander is not a pacifist. If he is attacked by Hamas or any other group, he will defend himself. He said: \"A son of our friends, two months ago he was killed here by a terrorist. He was a soldier in the reserves, 46 years old with six children. He volunteered for the reserves to protect me.\" \"If the army hadn't been there, they would have come here. He was killed while defending me. And today he is buried next to my two sons.\" But Gil Alexander seemed weary as we sat drinking tea amid the bright red flowers of his well-tended garden, and the fluttering yellow flags that symbolise Israel's hostages held in Gaza. He spoke of a beloved nephew killed fighting in Lebanon in an earlier war. Did he not, I wondered, at the age of 72, think about retiring from the struggle and enjoying his garden? He laughed. There was no chance of that. After two of his sons took their own lives \u2013 one was in the army, the other was about to enter the military \u2013 he had found a purpose in working for what he calls the \"humanitarian\" ideals of Judaism. \"After the tragedies of my sons, if I don't find meaning in life, I'll go crazy\u2026 And the things I do, are things I believe in. And these are things I also got from my father who was in the French underground during World War Two and fought for French liberation but was against any type of occupation and said, 'Occupation is Occupation.'\" Two days after our encounter with Moshe Sharvit, a lone woman peace activist filmed him banging on the window of her car and rocking the vehicle. The woman is clearly frightened by the intimidation. Moshe Sharvit acts as if he has nothing to fear.",

        "body": "'Proud to be young' - Beauty queen, lawyer and Botswana's youngest cabinet minister\n\n20 hours ago Share Save Anne Okumu & Brian Khisa BBC News, Gaborone Share Save\n\nLesego Chombo/Instagram\n\nLesego Chombo's enthusiasm for life is as infectious as her achievements are impressive: she has won the Miss Botswana 2022 and Miss World Africa 2024 crowns, is a working lawyer, has set up her own charitable foundation - and made history in November, becoming Botswana's youngest cabinet minister. She was just 26 years old at the time - and had clearly impressed Botswana's incoming President Duma Boko, whose Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) had just won a landslide, ousting the party that had governed for 58 years. It was a seismic shift in the politics of the diamond-rich southern African nation - and Boko, a 55-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer, hit the ground running. His main focus, he said, was fixing an economy too reliant on diamonds, telling the BBC ahead of his inauguration that he wanted young people to be the solution - \"to become entrepreneurs, employ themselves and employ others\". Key to this was finding a suitable ambassador - and Chombo was clearly it: a young woman already committed to various causes. He made her minister of youth and gender. \"I've never been more proud to be young,\" she told the BBC at the ministry's headquarters in the capital, Gaborone. \"I'm a young person living in Botswana, passionate about youth development, gender equality, but also so passionate about the development of children.\" The beauty queen did not campaign to be an MP - she is what is called a specially elected member of parliament - and is now one of just six female MPs in the 69-member National Assembly. Chombo said becoming an MP and then minister came as a complete surprise to her. \"I got appointed by a president who had never met me,\" she said. \"Miss World and the journey that I thought I was supposed to pursue as my final destination was only the platform through which I would be seen for this very role.\" It was her crowning as Miss Botswana in 2022 that raised her profile and enabled her to campaign for social change, while trying to inspire other young women. It also gave her the opportunity to set up the Lesego Chombo Foundation, which focuses on supporting disadvantaged youngsters and their parents in rural areas \u2013 and which she is still involved with, its projects funded by corporate companies and others. \"We strive to have a world where we feel seen and heard and represented. I'm very thrilled that I happen to be the very essence of that representation,\" she said.\n\nLesego Chombo/Instagram Lesego Chombo, now 27, is an associate at a law firm in Gaborone\n\nAs she prepared for last year's Miss World pageant, she said: \"I really put myself in the zone of service. I really channelled it for this big crown.\" Now in political office, she is aware of the expectations placed on her in a country where approximately 60% of the population is below 35 years. It also has a high level of unemployment - 28%, which is even higher for young people and women who have limited economic opportunities and battle systemic corruption. Chombo said this was something she was determined to change: \"Currently in Botswana, the rates of unemployment are so high. \"But it's not just the rate of unemployment, it's also just the sphere of youth development. \"It's lacking, and so my desire is to create an ecosystem, an environment, a society, an economy in which youth can thrive.\" Chombo said her plan was to develop a comprehensive system that nurtured youth-led initiatives, strengthened entrepreneurship and ensured young people had a seat at the table when decisions were being made. With Botswana's anti-corruption policy undergoing a rigorous review, she said this would ensure that quotas for young entrepreneurs - when state departments and agencies put out tenders for goods and services - were actually reached. The government has begun a 10-month forensic audit of government spending that will include 30 state-owned enterprises. Indeed President Boko is intent on cracking down on corruption, seeing this as a way to bolter investor confidence and diversify the economy - something his deputy has been seeking to do on recent trips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Switzerland. And a key deal has now been secured with UAE-based CCI Global, a provider of business process outsourcing, to open a hub in Botswana.\n\nWhile youth development is a central pillar of her work, gender equity also remains close to her heart. Her short time in office has coincided with a growing outcry over gender-based violence. According to a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, over 67% of women in Botswana have experienced abuse, more than double the global average. \"It hurts to know that it could be me next,\" she admitted. A month into her appointment, she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create \"peace desks\" at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims. At the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness. This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season - this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue. The minister reiterated - on several occasions, including before parliament in March - that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied. But she told the BBC the government would be pushing for the implementation of a Gender-Based Violence Act, aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors. She said she was also advocating a more holistic approach, involving the ministries of health, education and local government. \"We want curriculums that promote gender equity from a young age,\" Chombo said. \"We want to teach children what gender-based violence is and how to prevent it. \"It will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home, how parents behave around their children, how they model good behaviour.\"\n\nLesego Chombo/Instagram Lesego Chombo has used her fame to push her projects for social change - focusing on young people\n\nShe has also been vocal about the need to address issues affecting men, particularly around mental health and positive masculinity, encouraging chiefs \"to ensure that our patriarchal culture is not actively perpetuating gender violence\". \"I hear a lot of people say: 'Why do you speak of women more than men?' \"It's because as it stands in society, women are mostly prejudiced [against]. \"But when we speak of gender equality, we're saying that it should be applied equally for everyone. But what we strive for is gender equity.\" Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her - saying that women had to work \"10 times harder\" to succeed. \"[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive. And growing up, I got to realise that it's not an easy thing. \"As women, we face so many pressures: 'A woman cannot do this. A woman can't do that. A woman can't be young and in leadership.' I'm currently facing that.\" She also credited Julia Morley, the CEO of Miss World, for helping her: \"She has managed to create a legacy of what we call beauty with a purpose for so many young girls across the world. \"She has just inspired us so deeply to take up social responsibility.\" Chombo is serious about this. The beauty queen-cum-lawyer-cum-minister knows she has made history - but is also aware that her real work has only just begun. \"Impact. Tangible impact. That's what success would look like to me,\" she said. \"I want to look back and see that it is there and it is sustainable. That when I leave, someone else is able to carry it through.\" Additional reporting from Innocent Selatlhwa in Gaborone\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

        "body": "What is habeas corpus and why might Donald Trump want to suspend it?\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Robin Levinson King BBC News Share Save\n\nGetty Images White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller says Trump is considering suspending habeas corpus\n\nUS President Donald Trump's administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, the principle that a person should be able to challenge their detention in court. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, says the legal principle is a \"privilege\" that could be suspended to make it easier to detain and deport immigrants. Recent court challenges by migrants and dissenting students who have been held in immigration detention centres have cited habeas corpus as a reason for their release. But what the legal procedure does - and what could happen if it were to be suspended - is complex.\n\nWhat does habeas corpus mean?\n\nScholars say the principle that a person should not be illegally imprisoned pre-dates the Magna Carta, and has been a cornerstone of the legal system in the UK, US and other democratic countries around the world for centuries. Roughly translated from Latin, habeas corpus means \"you should have the body\" - as in, a person must be able to appear before a court so that a judge can assess if that person has been lawfully detained. Also known as the \"Great Writ of Liberty\", habeas corpus grants prisoners the right to challenge their imprisonment in a court of law.\n\nIs habeas corpus a right in the US Constitution?\n\nArticle One of the US Constitution states that \"the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\". While this is the only time habeas corpus is mentioned in the Constitution, it has become an important part of US law - and has frequently been fought over in the courts, including the US Supreme Court.\n\nHas habeas corpus been suspended before?\n\nAbraham Lincoln became the first US president to suspend habeas corpus in 1861, during the American Civil War. That led to a showdown with Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, who said it was Congress - not the executive branch of government - that had the power to suspend the writ. Lincoln continued to suspend habeas corpus in specific incidences, according to the National Constitution Center, and in 1863 Congress approved suspending it for the duration of the war when \"the public safety may require it\". It was also suspended several times in the years following the Civil War, during the Reconstruction period, to quash rebellions by the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group. After the bombing of Pearl Harbour by the Japanese in World War Two, habeas corpus was suspended in Hawaii, which paved the way for the arrest of Japanese Americans on the island.\n\nWhat do modern courts say about habeas corpus?",

        "body": "Along the Canada border, small-town America feels sting of Trump's trade war\n\n20 hours ago Share Save Ana Faguy BBC News Reporting from Port Huron, Michigan Share Save\n\nBBC\n\nAt the end of a waitressing shift, Kristina Lampert used to separate her tips in two piles: Canadian cash and American. But it's been weeks since she has done that. Freighters, the restaurant where she works, is one of the first places people can grab a bite after crossing the US-Canada border between Sarnia, Ontario, and Port Huron, Michigan. The Blue Water Bridge, which connects the US and Canada, is in full view from the restaurant's windows. \"A lot of people used to come over and say 'we're here for the view',\" she says of Canadian diners. \"I haven't heard that at all recently.\" Border towns noticed almost instantly when US President Donald Trump began imposing tariffs on countries around the world and saying he wanted to make Canada the 51st US state - because the number of Canadians crossing the border plummeted.\n\nKristina Lampert\n\nBorder crossings between the US and Canada are down some 17% since Trump started bringing in tariffs, according to CBP data. Canadian's car trips to the US are down almost 32% compared to March 2024, according to Statistics Canada. Like many of the towns that dot along the 5,525 mile (8,891km) border, the economies of Port Huron and Sarnia are linked and in some ways dependent on one another. Port Huron is a manufacturing town of less than 30,000 people with a quaint downtown and lots of retail, offering visitors an enticing opportunity for a day-trip. On a day where there is little traffic, a Sarnia resident can cross the border and be in Michigan in a matter of minutes. Many of these towns faced their first test more than five years ago when the Covid-19 pandemic shut crossings down for 19 months and left local economies reeling. Now, they are seeing a second economic hit due to Trump's trade war, with many Canadians choosing to \"buy Canadian\" and reducing travel to the US in response to the fraying relationship between the two neighbouring countries. One place this is being felt is at Sarnia's Duty Free, the last place you can purchase goods before leaving Canada and entering the US. The shelves of perfume and liquor are fuller and the parking lot is emptier since tariffs tensions began. Barbara Barett, the executive director of Frontier Duty Free Association, says some of the 32 land-border duty frees in Canada have seen as much as an 80% decrease in sales since Trump's return to the White House. Most stores have seeing a 50-60% drop in business. \"We're 100% reliant on the travel across the border,\" she says of duty frees. \"Our stores are often pillars of these communities - communities depend on them.\"\n\nBillboard in Port Huron, Michigan\n\nAnd while the crossing at Port Huron-Sarnia is faring better than most, on a Friday in May the parking lot of the Sarnia Duty Free is almost empty. Tania Lee, who runs the store with her family, says that has become the new norm. On Easter weekend - usually one of their busiest of the year, as Canadians take advantage of the break to stop in at a favourite restaurant and go to a church service in Port Huron - cars were few and far between, and sales were not what they should have been, she says. \"We are suffering because of collateral damage at the border,\" Ms Lee says of her second-generation family business. She notes that people who live in border towns often cross the boundary multiple times a week. Ms Lee, for example, has a mailbox at a shipping facility in Port Huron that she visits regularly, as do her neighbours.\n\nPort Huron Mayor Anita Ashford in front of Blue Water Bridge which connects Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario",

Top aid groups object to the idea\n\ntoggle caption Abdel Kareem Hana/AP\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 On the eve of President Trump's visit to Arab allies in the Gulf, the U.S. and Israel have announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies back into Gaza after a ten-week Israeli ban that aid workers say is driving rampant hunger in the territory.\n\nIt is the result of pressure by the Trump administration on Israel to allow aid back into Gaza, according to a person familiar with the details who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal diplomacy.\n\nThe proposed solution would only provide food and aid to around 60 percent of Gaza's civilians initially, according to a copy of the proposal reviewed by NPR. Key details remain unresolved, like who would run it or pay for it.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe program is an about-face from Israel's earlier policy to withhold aid to pressure Hamas to free Israeli hostages. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee says Israel is fully on board with the new proposal.\n\n\"President Trump has made very clear that one of the most urgent things that needs to happen is humanitarian aid into Gaza, and he has tasked all of his team to do everything possible to accelerate that and to as expeditiously as possible get humanitarian aid in, to the people,\" said Huckabee in a press conference Friday.\n\ntoggle caption Jehad Alshrafi/AP\n\nWhat the new aid plan would look like\n\nGaza's population would be forced to move south in order to receive aid in a new zone cordoned off by Israel's military, to prevent Hamas members from access, an Israeli defense official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity to divulge details.\n\nAccording to a 14-page proposal reviewed by NPR, a private charity recently registered in Switzerland called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation would establish four aid distribution sites and hand out pre-packaged food, hygiene kits and medical supplies.\n\nIsrael's foreign minister, Gideon Saar, publicly endorsed the U.S. plan Sunday and called on countries and aid groups to cooperate.\n\n\"It will enable aid to go directly to the people. Hamas must not be allowed to get their hands on it,\" Saar said. Israeli soldiers \"will not allocate aid. They will secure the perimeter.\"\n\nIsrael says Hamas has taken advantage of aid deliveries, seizing supplies, profiting from black market sales, and using aid distribution to assert its control of Gaza. U.N. officials say there is no large-scale diversion of aid in Gaza.\n\n\"The aid we coordinate goes to the people for whom it's intended,\" said Olga Cherevko of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \"We have mechanisms in place that help mitigate this, including monitoring during and after distribution, hotlines to report incidents and our accountability to donors.\"\n\nIsrael says it will first wait for Trump to finish his trip this week to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to allow the chance for a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas.\n\nIf no deal emerges by then, Israel vows to begin to roll out this plan, combined with intensified military ground operations and the seizure of more territory in Gaza.\n\ntoggle caption Jehad Alshrafi/AP\n\nMany of the plan's details are still unresolved\n\nAccording to the written proposal, the four initial aid distribution sites would serve a combined total of 1.2 million Palestinians. That is only about 60 percent of the estimated 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. Huckabee said the aid distribution would be scaled up to serve larger populations.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe main aid organizations working in Gaza are refusing to cooperate with the proposal, as presented by Israeli officials to the U.N. and its aid partners. Humanitarian groups say they cannot work with a program that refuses aid to anyone seeking it, even belligerents.\n\n\"It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2014 as part of a military strategy,\" the United Nations and its aid partners in Gaza said in a joint statement. \"We will not participate in any scheme that does not adhere to the global humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.\"\n\nThe U.S. says it is still in talks with aid professionals to finalize who would run the program. Huckabee said he did not have the details on who would fund the program, but cited some contributors who wish to remain unnamed.\n\ntoggle caption Jehad Alshrafi/AP\n\nWhy humanitarian aid groups oppose the program\n\nThe proposed U.S. aid program for Gaza would be a significant departure from the established U.N.-led system that has long been the cornerstone of humanitarian response in conflict zones, aid experts say.\n\nIt would skirt the already-existing system for aid delivery, replacing around 400 U.N. distribution points across Gaza with just around four distribution points, which experts say would overwhelm the system and make it hard to ensure fair distribution to hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nIt would advance Israel's plans to coerce Palestinians to move from north to south Gaza on Egypt's border, with eventual plans for the migration of Palestinians out of Gaza. Those are Israeli military strategies that humanitarian organizations do not want to endorse.\n\nIn the Iraq war, private security groups provided aid to civilians within the parameters of the Iraqi military, leading to ethical concerns, aid experts say.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The idea of getting aid is very important, but how aid is delivered is equally important. And there are massive red flags all over the place for this plan,\" said Paul Spiegel, director of the center for humanitarian health at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nNPR's Fatma Tanis reported from Washington, D.C.",

In Cape Town, the contrasts are particularly stark.\n\nIn the wealthier parts of town, affluent South Africans enjoy a better standard of living than in much of Europe or the U.S. This year, Time Out, a British media and hospitality company, ranked it the best city in the world, beating the likes of New York, Bangkok and London for the top spot.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAt the same time, more than half of the population lives below the government's \"upper bound poverty line\" \u2014 the level at which people can afford adequate food, clothing and other basic necessities. And huge parts of the city struggle with high unemployment, rampant violent crime and a lack of adequate housing and reliable services.\n\ntoggle caption Tommy Trenchard for NPR\n\n\"We try to stay positive and just to provide the best service we can,\" says Couch, adding that the hotel supports an adoption program for shelter dogs as well as being a significant local employer. \"If we didn't exist, that would be 25 people who didn't have a job anymore.\"\n\nCouch says the rates are designed to be \"relatively affordable,\" with prices ranging from 210 rand ($11.45) for a day care pass up to 410 rand ($22.30) for an overnight stay in a private room. For context, a government report published in 2024 found that half of all employed South Africans were earning less than R5,200 ($283.26) per month.\n\n\"Most of our clients are young working professionals,\" she says. \"People care about their dogs' mental health and well-being more than ever before. They don't want to leave their dogs at home alone anymore.\"\n\nAn 'amazing experience' for Fido and Fifi\n\nAmong the recreation options for Superwoof's canine guests are long walks in the park and weekend getaways among the vineyards of the Franschhoek Valley. The hotel also hosts weddings, \"tailored for dogs in love,\" featuring confetti, a red carpet, a customized veil for the bride and bow tie for the groom. For an extra fee, the couple can get a themed wedding cake or enjoy a night in a private honeymoon suite .\n\n\"We want to make sure the dogs have an amazing experience,\" says Couch. \"There's a lot of attention to detail.\"\n\nDog weddings might not be for everyone, but Couch says demand for Superwoof's services is booming, and they've received several requests from people around the country looking to replicate the model under a franchise agreement.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"It's a growing industry and I don't think that'll change,\" says Couch. \"Pet hotels are popping up everywhere and they're thriving. There's just such demand for it.\"\n\nThe industry is highly competitive, and rivalries between the dog hotel owners can be intense. \"It would make a great TV show,\" says Couch. \"Like Desperate Housewives but with dog hotel owners, fighting over a cosmo on a Friday night.\"\n\nSuperwoof's main rival in the city center is the atFrits Dog Hotel and Daycare, which opened its doors back in 2015, billing itself at the time as the continent's first luxury dog hotel. AtFrits boasts some particularly extravagant luxury flourishes. In the presidential suite, dogs can watch cartoons on a private TV from the comfort of a human-style bed complete with carved wooden headboard. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling and ornate, gilt-framed dog portraits adorn the walls.\n\ntoggle caption\n\nThe dogs can enjoy a wide range of health and wellness treatments, designed to help them \"find balance and harmony in their life,\" according to the website. These include everything from a basic wash, brush and blow-dry at the spa to hydrotherapy and even reiki, a form of Japanese energy-based alternative healing. A private outdoor dog park provides space for play and exercise. And for nervous owners, cameras provide a round-the-clock livestream so they check in on their dogs.\n\nIn defense of dog hotels\n\n\"People are always saying, how can you set up a dog hotel in a third world country?\" says atFrits' founder, Yanic Klue. \"But they don't realize small and medium businesses like this are what will make our country move forward. They're keeping the economy alive.\"\n\nAtFrits employs 38 people, supports various charities and runs a program that trains and equips women from marginalized communities to make pet clothing, which is then sold in the hotel gift shop. For every doggy bow tie or jacket you buy, that puts bread and butter on a family's table, says Klue.\n\ntoggle caption Tommy Trenchard for NPR\n\nShe says it's a misconception that most of those who use the hotel are ultrawealthy. Many, she says, are young people living in flats without gardens who don't have anywhere to leave their dogs while they're at work. One regular client is a waiter from a nearby restaurant.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"At first the idea of dog hotels didn't make any sense to me,\" says the hotel's former longtime manager, Sailas Mapahlala, who worked in a Cape Town pet shop before being recruited by atFrits in 2015. \"But then I realized it's actually a service people really need. Within a month of opening I could see that we were in for a busy ride. Within a year people were trying to copy our business.\"\n\ntoggle caption Tommy Trenchard for NPR\n\nIn the leafy suburb of Noordhoek, on the city's southern edge, Jayne Le Roux, the owner of Vienna's Village luxury dog hotel and day care, says she's having to turn away clients, \"left, right and center.\" She says the hotel is already fully booked for December 2025.\n\nThey HEART dogs\n\nWhen NPR visited on the morning of the 14th of February, preparations were underway for a doggy Valentine's Day party. Le Roux had ordered a batch of Valentine's Day themed dog treats and pink, heart-shaped cookies, which she planned to serve to the hotel guests with cubes of watermelon.\n\ntoggle caption Tommy Trenchard for NPR\n\nAhead of the event, the dogs roamed the spacious gardens, digging in the sand pit or exploring the play castle and model Cape Dutch-style dog cottage. Others played by the pool area, where murals of seaside scenes form the backdrop for a range of custom-built miniature dog sun loungers, cabanas and hanging basket chairs.\n\nThe hotel also features an immaculate spa, decorated with fake pink roses and acid green tiling beneath the vanity mirror. Soothing meditation music plays in the background while the guests get their treatments. Among the health and beauty products on offer are \"wild cherry puppy spritz,\" all-natural \"heavenly hemp body spray\" and \"tropical mango pet perfume.\"\n\ntoggle caption Tommy Trenchard for NPR\n\n\"I wanted to open a place for spoiled, pampered little dogs who are used to sleeping inside with lots of cuddles,\" says Le Roux, who launched the business in 2018. \"But I never expected it to take off like this.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nVienna's Village lies barely a mile from an informal settlement on the edge of the township of Masiphumelele, where poverty and unemployment are rife, and residents live in ramshackle structures of sheet metal and timber packed so tightly together there's barely space to walk between them.\n\nIn a bubble?\n\nAsked whether running a luxury dog hotel in such an environment ever gave rise to moments of cognitive dissonance, Le Roux appeared surprised.\n\n\"I guess you just don't see it,\" she said, of the poverty in the city, before adding, after a pause, \"I suppose we're in a bit of a bubble.\"\n\ntoggle caption Tommy Trenchard for NPR\n\nFor some dog owners, the emergence of the dog hotels has been life changing. \"If atFrits didn't exist, I wouldn't be able to keep her,\" said one client, a children's rights lawyer, as she arrived one morning to pick up her lurcher. \"She comes here whenever I'm in court or in chambers. She just loves it here.\" The lawyer asked not to be identified because as a condition of her employment, she cannot be quoted by name.\n\nTo others, however, the increasing presence of luxury dog hotels in a city where over 300,000 households are languishing on the government's waitlist for adequate housing, is hard to stomach.\n\ntoggle caption Tommy Trenchard for NPR\n\n\"We can't be prioritizing the 5% over the 95%,\" says Luyanda Mtamzeli, of the legal non-profit Ndifuna Ukwazi, which campaigns against inequality and the lack of affordable housing in Cape Town. \"You've got a huge number of people who need accommodation in the city, and then you've got the 5% of the population who need luxury hotels for their dogs. This whole situation underscores the lack of genuine political will to tackle the structural and deep-seated inequality that persists in Cape Town.\"\n\nFrom a street corner near his tent outside the Superwoof building, Asanda Ncanda says he bears no ill will toward the hotel or its owners, but that it's existence is nevertheless a constant reminder of the unfulfilled promises of post-apartheid South Africa.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I love animals, and I would never say they shouldn't be running their business,\" he says, as the sounds of excited barking float down from the skydeck. \"But what does it say about our society in South Africa? It hurts.\"\n\nTommy Trenchard is an independent photojournalist based in Cape Town, South Africa.

So I finally asked\n\ntoggle caption Family photo\n\n\"I want you to study hard so that you can rescue our family from poverty. Your father and I are poor and the only gift we can give you is an education. You are intelligent. Rise up and make your lives meaningful. I gave birth to you and I know you have what it takes to make it in life. Work hard my children.\"\n\nWhen I was a little girl in Kenya, hardly a day would pass without my mother repeating those words to my four siblings and me.\n\nBecause I was a child all I wanted to do was play hide and seek and netball. So her words fell on deaf ears. When she told us to work hard, we played harder.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBut my mother meant what she said. Anytime we were caught playing and not working hard at homework or chores like washing clothes and fetching firewood, she would punish us. I wish she did it differently.\n\nI still remember one day, when I was about 10, going to the river crying and wishing that she would get sick and lack the strength to punish me. I was very mad at her.\n\nAs we children grew up, we slowly grasped the wisdom in her words mostly because she led by example and lived by her words every day.\n\nBertha Ngumbi, my dear mother, is one of the most hardworking women I can think of. She and my dad, Harrison, were both teachers and managed to raise us on their combined salary of $200 a month.\n\nAnd because their teacher's salary was not enough we had to farm. So before going to school, my mother would wake up all of us at 5 a.m. to do farm chores. Come evening, we'd help my mother by going to the river about 15 minutes away to fetch water for drinking and bathing and by cooking dinner. After dinner, she would do her teaching preparation while we did our homework and reviewed our school notes.\n\nMy mother wasn't just tough. She was selfless. She sacrificed life's little pleasures so we could go to school and get an education. I still remember vividly how she and my dad would go to collect their paychecks but eat nothing before coming back in the evening, hungry and tired. I wondered at her ability to be in town, in the midst of all the best foods but choosing not to buy anything so she had enough money for our school fees.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThat determination and selflessness had a powerful effect on my siblings and me. Even though we grumbled, it inspired us to work hard and pursue our life's goal no matter the challenges, hurdles and circumstances.\n\nNow that I am grown, I appreciate the values and standards my mother instilled in us. If it were not for her words and tough stance, I would never have graduated from Auburn University with a Ph.D. in entomology \u2014 the first girl from our community of Mabafweni in Kwale County to get a doctoral degree.\n\nWhen I think back to my childhood, I can understand why she was so hard on us. But I've always wondered how she felt? Did she know we were mad at her for being so tough? Mama, why did you set the bar for us up so high? Why did you punish us so much? Why were you so insistent on us working hard in our early years? Why did you never give up on us?\n\nSo I had a conversation with my mother. Here's what I asked \u2014 and here's what she said.\n\nWhy were you so hard on us?\n\nMy children thought I was mad when I told them what I wanted them to become. They could not believe they possessed the capacity to achieve the standards I had set. But because I was their mother, I could see their potential. I pushed them hard so that they would make it in life. I watched them closely and monitored their performances in school and had the time to discuss their progress with their teachers. As they grew up and started to understand, I became their friend and this helped because they were free to discuss their problems with me.\n\nDid you know your children were mad at you for setting high standards?\n\nNo, I did not know they were mad. Deep down I knew everything I was doing was best for them in the long run.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWere you ever tempted to give in and be a \"fun\" mom?\n\nI stuck to my standards because I saw the potential in each of my children and I had to exploit that.\n\nWhat was the biggest sacrifice you made?\n\nI sacrificed my social life, money and time. But I would do it all over again.\n\nWhat advice do you have for moms today who are in the position you were in \u2014 facing poverty, trying to make sure their kids have enough to eat and can get an education and have a better life?\n\nLet their children be their biggest priority. Young mothers should focus on their children.\n\nHow could you collect a paycheck and come home, tired and hungry, without stopping to get something to eat? Did you ever just want to go buy some food you loved and sneak eat it?\n\nNo. I did not want to sneak eat because I had a mission to accomplish.\n\nWas there any role model or any wise advice or saying that helped you?\n\nMy mother was my role model. I had seen my mother struggle. I therefore wanted to set the bar up high for my children. I wanted them to accomplish their life goals.\n\nWhat's the toughest thing about being a mom?\n\nThe toughest thing was make my children understand that whatever I was doing was for them and was out of a mother's wish for her children to succeed in life.\n\nI didn't have to ask my mother if she is happy with how all her children turned out. I know she is very happy.\n\nHer eldest son, Kennedy, is a businessman, farmer and entrepreneur. I'm her second born and I'm a scientist. Her third born, Faith, is a counselor. Her fourth born, Kalekye, is a manager and consultant in a health-care NGO. And her last born, Kavuu, is a nurse. All her efforts, sacrifices and selflessness paid off.\n\nToday, my mother and I continue to share a beautiful relationship. Week after week, in our phone conversations, she urges me to work hard just as she did when I was a child.\n\nI am forever grateful to my mother, and I love her from the bottom of my heart.\n\nEsther Ngumbi is an Assistant Professor of Entomology and African American Studies at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.",

Here are your most memorable moments with Mom for Mother's Day\n\ntoggle caption Julie Walton-Davidson, Lora Hinkson and via Joe Tanner\n\nWhen Brianna McIndoe was growing up in Tampa, Fla., her mother, Lisa McIndoe, maintained a beautiful flower garden in front of their home that attracted neighbors who would stop by to admire it.\n\n\"To this day, I am impressed by her ability to grow something beautiful where there was nothing before,\" recalls Brianna, now 34. \"I remember sitting outside with her planting seeds in the early spring, and she would teach me about the different varieties.\"\n\nAmong those seeds were various types of the cockscomb flower, a uniquely shaped, fuzzy plant that comes in many colors and was a favorite of both Brianna and her mother. The irony of it also being known as the \"brain flower\" held little significance for them at the time.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThis past April, on a warm spring day while her children, ages 7 and 5, were on break from school, Brianna took them on a scenic 7 1/2-hour drive from their home in Augusta, Ga., to visit their grandmother Lisa in Lutz, a suburb of Tampa.\n\n\"When we arrived at the nursing home, my mom didn't recognize me,\" Brianna says.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, Brianna and the kids left to visit other relatives and friends before heading back home. As they started their journey homeward, Brianna felt a strong urge to visit her mom again.\n\nThis time, they stayed for a few more hours. The kids worked on a puzzle, while Brianna attempted to engage her mother in conversation, even though it was mostly unsuccessful.\n\n\"Right before we were getting ready to leave, my daughter mentioned the puzzle, and I turned to my mom and asked, 'Was I like this when I was younger?' \" Brianna recalls. \"For a brief moment, I saw a glimpse of my mom again. She laughed and said, 'You were just like that as a kid. She is just like you.' In that moment, I knew she remembered, and it brought me so much joy.\"\n\nBrianna's story is among nearly 500 shared with NPR after we invited readers to submit their favorite memories of their moms, whether their mothers are still present for them to hug or live on in their hearts. Brianna's experience is also one of many that highlight the struggles of mothers dealing with dementia. Brianna says her mother, 63, is in a nursing home, receiving full-time care due to early-onset dementia.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"My mom is both alive and gone,\" Brianna says.\n\nAmid this struggle, Brianna has contemplated the legacies that many think of when considering their mothers.\n\n\"Something she always tells me is to leave things better than you found them. I'm trying to do that with my kids, making sure they have a better life than I had.\"\n\nBrianna's sentiments were reflected in numerous submissions from across the United States and beyond \u2014 as far away as Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and Asia. They came from people in their 20s to their 70s, representing many races, genders, ethnicities and religious beliefs.\n\nNPR received a flood of nostalgic stories \u2014 memories of moms from childhood, along with adult reflections that often showed that no matter how old we become, moms still surprise us.\n\nThere were humorous tales of moms' antics that left us laughing, valuable pieces of moms' advice that we might just adopt, and stories that tugged at our hearts, especially those poignant stories about mothers who have passed away.\n\nMany favorite memories of Mom stem from her advice\n\ntoggle caption Michael Sweet\n\nUnsurprisingly, stories about life lessons taught by moms are among the favorite memories people cherish. Even if you could barely walk when she dropped those gems, you may now be watching your own children carry on that legacy today.\n\nTake Michael Sweet, 62, a father of four, for example. He recalls that of everything his mother, Donna Sweet, 83, instilled in him, the most vivid and life-changing moment occurred when he was just 4 years old.\n\nAt that time, Michael's family lived in a small working-class town in Pennsylvania. It was a segregated neighborhood, but Michael remembers attending a preschool filled with \"kids of all races and abilities.\" The year was 1967, a tumultuous time in American history. Each evening with his parents, he would tune in to the CBS Evening News, getting \"a rundown of the horrors\" unfolding across the nation.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Walter Cronkite had been showing news footage of a lot of people who happened to have darker skin color than mine marching down streets wearing Sunday-best clothing: men, women and, most impactful for me, kids,\" Michael recalls.\n\n\"Then the film showed the same people being beaten by policemen. Firemen were knocking women and kids to the ground, and they were getting pinned against buildings by high-pressure firehoses. Worst, as far as I was concerned, was big German shepherds were being sent to bite all these people.\"\n\nThe dog attacks were particularly incomprehensible to him, as his favorite TV show featured Lassie, a heroic collie. This shocking contrast upended his understanding of the world; to him, police and firefighters were figures who protected people, not ones who caused harm. Confused, he finally asked his mother why these people were being hurt.\n\n\"Was it because Black people are bad? That was the only logical answer I could come up with,\" Michael says.\n\nThis question shook his mother, and she devised a plan to help him understand.\n\nHe remembers her saying, \"Some people just won't accept others if their shells are different colors.\" His mother helped him understand that the protests he saw on TV were about people demonstrating against the mistreatment of Black individuals because of the color of their skin, and that such behavior was wrong.\n\nMichael doesn't recall many discussions about civil rights, but that conversation with his mother was \"all I ever needed to set my moral compass.\"\n\n\"From that moment, I knew I was going to protect anyone who was being treated mean[ly] even if it meant stopping the police.\"\n\nLater in life, Michael became a police officer in Ohio.\n\n\"I wasn't able to help those kids back in 1967, but for 29 years, that was my number one job \u2014 protecting anyone in harm's way.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\"\n\ntoggle caption Bobbi Jo Dziuk\n\nIn the late 1940s, Bobbi Jo Dziuk's dad was a bachelor farmer living in North Dakota. One of his brothers met a lovely woman from New York and got married. It turned out she had a lovely single cousin as well. Thus began the courtship between Bobbi's parents, which initially took place through letters. They married in January 1956, and Bobbi's mom, Eva Erbele, moved to bitterly cold North Dakota. This transition was particularly challenging for a woman who had grown up in tropical Puerto Rico before moving to the Bronx. But the newlywed couple believed their love would keep them warm.\n\nOver the next 60 years, they were rarely apart. One year, Bobbi's dad needed surgery and had to be hospitalized overnight. Since the hospital was a few hours away from home, Bobbi and her mom decided to stay at a hotel.\n\n\"As we shared a bed that night, she asked if I would lay my head right next to hers on the pillow, with our foreheads touching and holding hands, 'cause 'that's how we fall asleep every night,' \" Bobbi recounts. \"I teased my mom if I should sing her lullabies too. Her quiet reply, 'I would love that!' So forehead to forehead, holding hands, in the dark, I sang my mom lullabies until she fell asleep.\"\n\nBobbi, 56, remembers she sang nursery rhymes like \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\"\n\nHer father made a full recovery but died three years later \u2014 during the winter. The following nine years were difficult for her mom, as she had rarely been apart from her husband.\n\nBobbi and her siblings did their best to bring her comfort, even as dementia and Parkinson's disease started to take a toll. Eventually, they moved her into a senior care facility, which helped her to adjust to being alone.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBefore her mother became ill, Bobbi was able to create many cherished memories with her, including moments with Bobbi's now 22-year-old son. However, she says none stands out to her like that night at the hotel.\n\n\"This memory has become more precious since she passed away [March 20] at the age of 92,\" Bobbi says.\n\nMom's cooking is the best\n\ntoggle caption Lora Hinkson\n\nFor many people, Mom's food is the best, and countless memories are created around the cuisine that shaped their childhood and has even been passed on as tradition. For example, Lora Hinkson from Barbados cherishes her mom's sweet bread, a Caribbean delicacy filled with coconut. Although her mother, Carmelia \"Dinks\" Hinkson, has been gone since 2016, Lora, now an accountant in her 40s, can still vividly recall the delicious aroma of that bread wafting through the house and even into the streets whenever she thinks of her mom.\n\n\"The scent was special, yes. The scent, slightly sweet and spicy from the coconut. Added to that, also the warmth of the oven,\" Lora recounts. \"On cold rainy days, when the house could be cold and miserable, the warmth of the oven just made the house feel cozy. Welcoming. Like home.\"\n\nNew York attorney Subhan Ali fondly remembers the enticing curry flavors that filled his family's home while he was growing up in India and in their new community after they moved to the U.S. His mother, Syeda Ali, insisted on making several dishes for him to freeze whenever they visited each other, ensuring he would always have a taste of home and her delicious cooking.\n\nDespite his efforts to dissuade her, she wouldn't hear of it.\n\ntoggle caption Subhan Ali\n\n\"On what would become my last trip to see her, her health had declined, and she had to be admitted to the hospital,\" he recalls. \"The doctor called to inform me that she had stage 4 lung cancer. At 88, this meant she didn't have much time left. After the call, I walked back to her room, and before I could say a word, she said rather longingly, 'If I were back home, I could have cooked something for you.' In that moment, it hit me that she would never cook for me again.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHis mother died on July Fourth in 2018.\n\n\"Long after her passing, I warmed up some frozen food she had prepared and ate it,\" he says. \"My mother would have been in her seventh heaven that her children were still enjoying her cooking, even after she had died!\"\n\nLet me tell you about legacy\n\nAn equally impactful memory was shared by Suzette Takacs, a 71-year-old retired teacher from Campbell, Calif., of her mom, Phyllis Rosnes, who is now 95. Suzette says it has guided her throughout her life, despite it occurring when she was just 11 years old.\n\nAt the time, they lived in Southern California. It was just a typical summer day, and they were at a grocery store, where a large table displayed fresh green grapes. Both mother and daughter loved grapes, and Suzette gazed at her mom with anticipation, longing for the juicy treats. But her mother just stood staring at the grapes, appearing in deep thought.\n\n\"Mom looked down at me then and said, 'I would love to buy some of these grapes, but I've been hearing that the people who pick them are not being treated very well. That's not right, so we're not going to buy any,' \" Suzette recounted.\n\nThis was in 1965 during a time when Cesar Chavez and the farm workers union were instrumental in organizing the Delano Grape Strike and boycott, which lasted until 1970 and advocated for farmworker rights.\n\nSuzette reflects that in that moment, her mom took a stance that taught her to always consider the plight of others and to help them, even in small ways.\n\n\"I love my sweet mom, but I love her all the more for teaching me this valuable and life-altering lesson. I'm still so proud of her! Helping others in need has always brought us the greatest joy.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSuzette's own daughter, Erin, continues this legacy by working as a teacher for children with disabilities.\n\ntoggle caption via David Taffner\n\nSimilarly, David Taffner, a 56-year-old manager in pharmaceuticals from Michigan, reflects on his own learning experience from his mother, Dorothy Taffner, who loved crossword puzzles and would solve them with his dad. It wasn't until well into his adult life that he finally bought a New York Times crossword puzzle book. When his parents visited and noticed his unfinished puzzles, his mom offered him a simple piece of advice: \"If you think you know the answer, write it in \u2014 it's probably correct.\"\n\nFor years, David ignored this advice. However, recently, after 20 years of second-guessing and five years after his mom passed away, he started following her suggestion. \"And damn, she was right! I've got the right answer more often than not,\" he says.\n\n\"Now, my daily habit of working a crossword puzzle brings me more joy because I know Mom would be nodding her head at all the things I've learned,\" David says.\n\nDo what I do\n\ntoggle caption Julie Walton-Davidson\n\nSome lessons are learned not from what is said directly to a child, but from what they overhear when adults are unaware that they're listening. This was the experience shared by high school teacher Julie Walton-Davidson. Now in her 40s, Julie recalls a grocery store visit from her childhood with her mother, Connie Walton, who is now 83 years old.\n\n\"A neighbor stopped to chat. I had turned the aisle when I heard the neighbor referring to me, saying, '\u2026 she is stunning.' My mom responded by saying, 'You should see her heart.' She didn't know I had overheard her, but that day she raised the bar and set it,\" Julie remembers. \"Her words have been a constant reminder throughout my life of what's most important.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNow, Julie is raising her two daughters, ages 20 and 23, with similar ideals, teaching them to always recognize their value beyond superficial appearances and to be good and kind individuals.\n\nHonoring Mom after she's gone\n\ntoggle caption via Bob Simons\n\nNot every memory of a mother is reminiscent of a Hallmark greeting card or a heartwarming holiday movie. Not all mothers are portrayed as the ideal parental figures their children wish for. But losing a mother is undoubtedly one of the most heartbreaking experiences.\n\nMany people have shared the moment their mom passed away. While the pain of losing a loved one is unfathomable, some find remarkable ways to honor their memory.\n\n\"My mom passed away on my birthday in 2019, at the age of 89,\" recounts Bob Simons, a dad of three who lives in Atlanta. \"I am truly honored that she passed on the same day that she gave birth to me 58 years earlier.\"\n\nNow 64, Bob cherishes that last visit he had with his mom, Elisabeth Simons, a Holocaust survivor from Vienna. She escaped to the U.S. with her mom and sister. She spent much of her adult life in Boston as a doctor and medical school professor while raising Bob and his sister.\n\n\"On the evening before she died \u2026 I was blessed to be able to spend an hour and a half with her, just listening to her reminisce about her life,\" Bob shares. \"She started our conversation saying, 'It's been a good life \u2026' to which I responded, 'Mom, it's been a great life!' \"\n\ntoggle caption Bob Simons\n\nAfter her passing, many of her students wrote tributes, and Bob's brother-in-law compiled them into a book. On Bob's birthday each year \u2014 the anniversary of his mother's death \u2014 the family reads these tributes in her memory. Bob also keeps her memory alive with the opening line he used in her eulogy:\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I still talk with Mom every day, the only difference is that now I can get a word or two in every once in a while.\"\n\nJoe Tanner has a similar memory of his mother.\n\nSure, he loved her laugh, watching her dance around the kitchen while singing country music, and of course her comforting hugs, especially as they sat on the couch in their cozy Utah home, where she would ask him about his day. But nothing compares to the day she showed up at his place after receiving an important message.\n\n\"My mom has always been very loving, but was also very religious. I knew she would be kind, but I also knew that it would be something that would make her have to face some decisions that were tough,\" Joe recounts. \"I knew that she was going to worry about me. I was too nervous to have to see her face or worry about the heartbreak, so I came out to her in an email.\"\n\ntoggle caption via Joe Tanner\n\nThe timing was incredible, he recalls. The day before he sent the email, his mom's computer had been hacked, so she took it for repairs.\n\n\"The day she got her computer back, she saw my email and drove two hours unannounced to come and see me,\" he says. She initially made small talk, he says, then \"just grabbed me and gave me the biggest hug she could give and started crying. She needed me to know what happened and that nothing could have changed the love that she had for me.\"\n\nHe was 32 at the time.\n\n\"Then we sat and cried together and made sure that we each knew how much we loved and appreciated one another.\"\n\nJoe's mom, Denille Andrus, died six years ago of cancer. She was 61.\n\n\"She wanted to show love and support to me, as well as give a nod to my religious siblings and wanted to have rainbows at her funeral. She asked my sisters to paint rainbows on her fingernails.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMom's high jinks and love are unmatched\n\nJanean Schmidt from Spokane, Wash., shares a riveting memory of her mom, Janet Joregsen, now in her 70s.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, while they were living in Los Angeles, the musical Cats was all the rage. Although Janean's mom was not a fan of the genre, Janean was obsessed with it. For her 16th birthday, she insisted on going to see Cats and, surprisingly, her mom reluctantly agreed. They decided to make a whole day of it, including dinner near the theater.\n\nJanean reminisces about how back then during intermission, attendees could walk onstage and get close to the oversized set pieces and even collect autographs from characters.\n\n\"We all walk onto the stage, and my mom turns around to face the audience, and belts out just the title word to the show's biggest hit: 'Meeeeeemmm-rrryyyyy... There, now I can say I've sung 'Memory' on the stage of Cats,\" Janean hilariously recalls.\n\n\"I occasionally remind her of that moment, I loved it so much.\"\n\nIn contrast to Janean's mother, Angel Limb's mom, Cora Mae, had a strong affinity for musical arts, especially the tunes of World War II, during which she came of age. Cora loved swing and Big Band music, which she called \"war tunes,\" and she frequently sang these to Angel. By age 4, Angel knew the lyrics to dozens of her mom's favorite tunes, believing no other genre existed.\n\n\"On my first day of kindergarten, l knew none of the songs my teacher Miss Leonard sang with the class,\" Angel, a Virginia resident, recalls. \"She asked why l did not sing. I told her that l had never heard 'The Itsy-Bitsy Spider' or 'Old MacDonald Had a Farm.' \"\n\nPerplexed, Miss Leonard asked what songs she did know.\n\n\"l belted out a few bars of the Andrews Sisters' 1941 hit 'Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,' and added a few of their dance moves as well. I can still see the look on Miss Leonard's face that clearly said, 'What an oddball!'\n\n\"My first kindergarten report card described me as '\u2026 bright, confident, and offbeat.' Unusual upbringing? Yes, please, and thanks, Mom!\"\n\nFor Patricia Avila from San Benito, Texas, a similarly memorable moment occurred a decade ago when she took her mom, Aurora Avila, on a trip to Hawaii. Patricia was looking forward to her mother climbing to the top of the 750-foot Diamond Head, but her then-72-year-old mom felt daunted by the challenging ascent and opted to stay at the base. Patricia climbed with friends, and moments after reaching the summit, something unexpected happened.\n\n\"A friend tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to my mom,\" Patricia recalls. \"I remember feeling surprised to see her on the top of Diamond Head and proud of her accomplishment. It was the highlight of the trip!\"\n\nMy mom's the undefeated comedian\n\nOverall, the responses to our callout show that even though some may not have the most joyful experiences with their mom, the memories that are most cherished are those precious moments that make a child feel most comforted, safe, cared for and valued. Scarcely would a child feel love without the undeniable support of their mom and presence of laughter.\n\nEnglish professor Makayla Steiner, 39, dares you to prove this notion wrong with her reflection on running for student council in ninth grade. She was quiet and shy, and neither she nor her mom, Camille Callister, a high school teacher, was sure she would be elected.\n\ntoggle caption via Makayla Steiner\n\nHowever, her mom diligently helped her make campaign posters and treats. When the winners were announced, Makayla was shocked to see her name on the list. She gathered posters and walked home, excited to tell her mom. As she entered the front door, her mother looked at her in anticipation.\n\n\"I smiled, shrugged, and said, 'I won!' \" Makayla recalls.\n\nHer mom screamed with joy, hugged her, and they danced around. Then, Camille pulled a cake out of the oven.\n\ntoggle caption Camille Callister\n\n\"It was colorfully decorated and she had piped 'The thrill of victory!' on top,\" Makayla remembers.\n\nMakayla was pleased, but she wondered aloud what her mother would have done if she had lost.\n\nHer mom grinned sheepishly, then went back to the oven and pulled out a smaller cake.\n\n\"She had decorated it with blue foot-shaped candies and had piped 'Da Agony of Da-Feet!' on it. I laughed, and in the 20-plus years since then, I have remembered fondly that lesson: that win or lose, my mom was going to be there for and with me, and in good humor. She's the best!\"\n\nHappy Mother's Day to all moms \u2014 whether alive or living on in our hearts!",

        "body": "Federal employee unions fight for survival as Trump tries to eviscerate them\n\ntoggle caption Andrea Hsu/NPR\n\nBy late March, Anthony Lee should have gotten a heads up that mass layoffs at the Food and Drug Administration were about to begin.\n\nInstead the union president found out when he started getting panicked calls early one morning.\n\nEmployees were learning they were being fired while swiping their badges to get into work. A green light meant go. A red light meant stop.\n\n\"For dozens, hundreds of employees, it just went red and they weren't able to enter the building,\" Lee says. \"That's the way a lot of people did find out that their federal service was ending.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLee is president of NTEU Chapter 282, the union representing close to 9,000 FDA employees. Under the union's collective bargaining agreement, the government is required to provide advance notice of any reduction in force.\n\nBut the Trump administration gave no such notice. Nor did it consult with Lee when it ended the union's telework agreement.\n\n\"Basically we've been ignored,\" says Lee.\n\nAttacks on unions \"exponentially worse\"\n\nPresident Trump's antipathy toward federal sector unions is well known. Still, Lee says Trump's attacks on unions now are \"exponentially worse\" than in the president's first term.\n\n\"Even our ability to exist in the federal workplace \u2014 to be able to represent employees \u2014 is threatened by this administration,\" he says.\n\nTrump's efforts to slash the federal workforce by hundreds of thousands of workers could decimate union bargaining units. And even where workers remain, he has moved to end the right to union representation for wide swaths of the workforce.\n\nIn late March, Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal workers, citing a provision in federal law that gives presidents the authority to do so at agencies that have national security as a primary mission.\n\nAlready, employees at agencies such as the CIA, the FBI and the National Security Agency have no collective bargaining rights.\n\nTrump's executive order went much further, sweeping up a broad array of agencies those exclusions have never applied to, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the FDA.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMultiple lawsuits are challenging that order. In late April, a federal judge issued an injunction, blocking it for now, but the Trump administration has appealed that decision.\n\nCollective bargaining as a check on presidential power\n\nTrump has argued that having to negotiate with unions over workplace matters impedes his ability to manage the government as he sees fit.\n\nSome would say that's by design.\n\nIn a New York University Law Review article , Nicholas Handler, an associate professor of law at Texas A&M School of Law, argues that collective bargaining serves as a check on presidential power. The binding agreements that unions negotiate with federal agencies over personnel matters such as working conditions, performance reviews, and grievance procedures \"restrain and reshape the President's power to manage the federal bureaucracy,\" he writes.\n\ntoggle caption Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images North America\n\nCivil servants did not always have this leverage. In the first half of the 20th century, even as labor unions gained strength elsewhere, there was a fear of giving federal workers too much say over how the nation's laws were carried out. After all, civil servants serve the American people.\n\nAs such, federal employees have never had the right to strike. They also can't negotiate over wages.\n\nA recruiting crisis led to a turning point\n\nBut in the early 1960s, the federal government was facing a labor crunch. It needed scientists, economists and lawyers to staff growing agencies, but it couldn't pay big salaries. What it could offer was stability, job protections, and \u2014 after President John F. Kennedy signed a 1962 executive order \u2014 the right to unionize.\n\n\"Collective bargaining becomes an attractive tool for presidents to recruit people into the federal civil service and take advantage of a lot of those highly skilled workers that otherwise might be difficult to recruit,\" says Handler.\n\nCongress later codified those labor protections in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, asserting that the right to organize and collectively bargain \"contributes to the effective conduct of public business\" and \"safeguards the public interest.\"\n\nThrough the law, Congress also created for itself and the courts a way to police the executive branch, Handler says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nConsider a scenario in which a president wants to weaken a particular agency, such as the EPA. One way to undermine the agency would be to make life for EPA workers miserable, he explains. Collective bargaining gives those employees a way to push back, to preserve their ability to carry out their agency's mission as Congress intended.\n\nNow, Trump says those labor rights Congress established in 1978 make federal workers unaccountable.\n\n\"The CSRA enables hostile Federal unions to obstruct agency management,\" states a White House document explaining his executive order. \"This is dangerous in agencies with national security responsibilities.\"\n\nLosing protections that made the jobs worthwhile\n\nLee, a 23-year veteran of the FDA in addition to being union president, worries that if Trump gets his way, workers will lose the stability and protections that made working for the government worthwhile.\n\nHe's especially concerned that scientists will become vulnerable to political pressure. Under the union contract, employees who review food ingredients, drugs and medical devices have a right to flag safety or efficacy concerns without fear of retribution.\n\n\"It remains to be seen as to whether or not they're going to allow employees to do the job that the public expects, protecting and promoting the health and safety of the public,\" Lee says.\n\nA debate over efficiency\n\ntoggle caption Andrea Hsu/NPR\n\nOne of Trump's repeated complaints is that unions make it too hard to get rid of poor performers. Many union contracts spell out lengthy processes for doing so.\n\nBut others contend unions help make the government run more smoothly.\n\n\"Our collective bargaining agreement is a huge efficiency boost for the government,\" says Armando Rosario-Lebron, a vice president of the National Association of Agriculture Employees, which represents employees of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\nHis bargaining unit includes people who are tasked with keeping invasive pests and plants out of the country, work that requires a lot of overtime. Rosario-Lebron says the union largely manages that.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"You have some employees who want as much overtime as possible to earn as much income as they can. You have other employees who don't want to be overworked to death, so to speak,\" he says.\n\nFiguring out how to assign overtime and being the liaison between management and employees probably represent the union's biggest savings to the government, says Rosario-Lebron.\n\n\"I know that a lot of managers love that,\" he says.\n\nRosario-Lebron says he tries to resolve most disputes outside the formal grievance process. He says there are plenty of times he's advised employees against pursuing complaints he sees as frivolous.\n\n\"I don't recommend you go down that path because it's not going to end well for you,\" he says he's told them.\n\nEmployees are more likely to listen to the union on such matters, he says.\n\nHe has a warning for the Trump administration: Get rid of the union and management will be on its own.",

It said 60 drones were shot down and another 41 simulator drones failed to reach targets due to Ukrainian countermeasures.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday accused Ukraine of \"violating\" Moscow's three-day ceasefire more than 14,000 times.

We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire \u2014 full, lasting, and reliable \u2014 starting tomorrow, May 12th, and Ukraine is ready to meet,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nPutin in remarks to the media overnight effectively rejected that ceasefire offer and proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday instead \"without preconditions.\" He said a ceasefire might be agreed on during the negotiations.\n\nPutin's counteroffer came after leaders from four major European countries threatened to ratchet up pressure on Moscow if it does not accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine that they offered on Saturday in a strong show of unity with Kyiv.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn a social media post several hours after Putin's remarks, U.S. President Donald Trump said it was \"a potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!\"\n\n\"I will continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens.

        "body": "Tariff troubles: A rubber duck museum is migrating to Canada to stay afloat\n\ntoggle caption Neil King\n\nIf you had to pick just one place to take the temperature of relations between the U.S. and Canada right now, consider The Rubber Duck Museum in Point Roberts, Wash.\n\nThe museum is located in a small U.S. town attached to Canada, not the U.S. mainland. The only way to drive to the town, which is at the end of a peninsula, is to go through Canada. This unique location makes the town of about 1,200 people dependent upon its northern neighbor for nearly everything, including customers looking to add to their rubber duck collections.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nNeil and Krystal King are the owners of the rubber duck museum and gift shop. On display, they have ducks from the Soviet era, early Disney toys and a rubber ducky belonging to Sesame Street star Ernie. But a big draw \u2014 and what keeps the museum afloat \u2014 are the 3,000 ducks for sale. Most are whimsical, featuring celebrities and historical figures, and cartoon and holiday-themed characters.\n\nBut the ducks are no longer flying off the shelves. Since President Trump launched tariff wars on countries, including Canada and China, and began insisting Canada will be the 51st state , far fewer Canadian visitors have flocked to this U.S. outpost. After months of dismal sales, and now looking at 145% tariffs on goods from China, the Kings say they are packing up the ducks and moving them across the border into Canada.\n\ntoggle caption Neil King\n\n\"We've had a lot of regulars and loyal customers reach out to us throughout this whole thing the last couple of months, and they're pretty much all saying the exact same thing,\" Krystal said. \"They feel very offended by a lot of the rhetoric coming out of the White House right now.\"\n\nRelations soured between the two countries in February when President Trump, in a phone call to then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, questioned the validity of the border treaty between the U.S. and Canada. Trump also mentioned his dislike of the long-standing water-sharing agreements between the two countries, and negotiations over several deals have since been put on pause .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPresident Trump has said tariffs are to stop countries that he says are taking advantage of the U.S., including Canada, and to strengthen the nation's economic position.\n\nMany Canadians see it differently.\n\n\"What he [Trump] wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" Trudeau told the news media in March.\n\nAfter Washington imposed 25% tariffs on Canada, Ottawa answered in kind . Trudeau urged Canadians to stay home and spend their money domestically. And that's just what many have done.\n\n\"They don't like their sovereignty being threatened,\" Krystal said. \"They feel like the only tool they have is boycotting the United States and keeping those tourist dollars out of there.\"\n\nIt appears to be working. In March, the number of cars going through the busy border crossing in Blaine, Wash., was down nearly 28% compared to the previous year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. (Canadians make up the largest number of international visitors to the U.S., and last year they generated $20.5 billion in spending, according to the nonprofit U.S. Travel Association .) But it's also true that the Canadian dollar has fallen in value \u2014though it has recently clawed back some of its losses\u2014making the U.S. more expensive and less attractive.\n\n\"I'd say it's a pretty effective tool,\" Krystal said, referring to the boycott. Normally, the small town's streets are bustling with Canadians who love to cross the border for cheaper food and gas. These days the shops and restaurants are nearly empty.\n\n\"Every conversation we've had, they've been very polite in true Canadian fashion,\" she said. \"Very apologetic that it'll affect us personally. But yeah, they're feeling very strongly right now about this issue.\"\n\nThere are other factors at work. Nearly all the ducks the Kings sell in their gift shop are made in China, so they are subject to the 145% tariffs that President Trump placed on China and went into effect last month.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere is a limit on how much someone is going to pay for a rubber duck, the business owners said.\n\n\"We already have to keep our prices artificially low because of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar,\" Krystal said. \"So our customers coming in already have compromised buying power.\"\n\nThe Kings, who opened up the museum almost a year ago, said they simply can't afford to keep the Rubber Duck Museum open in Point Roberts. But they don't want to close their doors either. \"It is so unique, so fun,\" Neil said. \"The people that come in just laugh and laugh \u2026 and we just don't want to lose that.\"\n\nThis summer, they plan to move the museum collection and shop just across the border into Canada and reopen there. They won't have to pay the 145% tariffs on the ducks from China. And they won't be at the whims of international diplomacy, or the lack of it. They'll continue to live in Point Roberts, the place they call home and where they are raising their 3-year-old daughter.\n\nEven if President Trump were to suddenly drop the tariffs, the Kings said they would still move their little museum to Canada.\n\n\"It's just the instability of, you know, waking up every day and going, 'Is today a tariff day or not?' \" Neil said. \"It just isn't a sustainable business model for any small business, let alone a small business that is reliant on Canadian tourism.\"\n\n\"It's not the step we wanted to take, honestly,\" Krystal added. \"We love having our quaint little shop here. It means so much to us\u2026 But it's not a choice between moving the ducks to Canada or keeping them here. It's a choice between moving to Canada or closing.\"",

Isolated spots are expected to see as much as 12 inches of rain.\n\nFlorida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina are forecast to see most of the effects of the atmospheric river.\n\nThe chances of rain in the area \"will increase later this weekend, with the potential for heavy rainfall Monday through Tuesday, which could result in flooding,\" the NWS said early Saturday.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAn atmospheric river is, essentially, a concentrated area of water vapor that transports large amounts of water through the sky.\n\nThey usually come from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western U.S. But not this time.\n\n\"California gets a lot of precipitation in the winter from these,\" said Andrew Hazelton an associate scientist at the University of Miami, where he works with NOAA.\n\nBut it's not rare for atmospheric rivers to land in areas outside of California, he said. They typically happen because of a \"cutoff low,\" according to Hazelton \u2014 when the jet stream from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean gets cut off. This cutoff leads to a diversion. It turns the jet stream into a closed-off low-pressure system. Where many atmospheric river events hit straight from East to West, the closed off low pressure routes back East.\n\nThis southeast-bound event just might help certain areas that have seen recent droughts, the scientist said.\n\nCertain areas in Florida, including Central Florida, had a dry winter and are witnessing a drought. More precipitation in these locations could make up for the harsh cold season.\n\n\"When you get too much rain in a short period of time, it can be a flooding and flash flood threat,\" Hazelton said. \"So, I would keep an eye on that, but hopefully it'll be more beneficial.\"\n\nSmall creeks, streams, and low-lying areas could see a bit of extra water, according to Hazelton.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFor areas that are prone to flooding, the same precautions for any other high-precipitation event still stand.\n\n\"Always remember to turn around, don't drown,\" Hazelton said about the atmospheric river event that could lead to flooding in certain areas. \"If you happen to be out and there's a flash flood, don't try to go through it \u2014 because that's the thing. Just a couple of inches of water can knock you off your feet. Be safe and stay on high ground till the water subsides.\"\n\n",

Israel has blocked all aid, including food, medicine and fuel, for 70 days.\n\nThe Hamas statement did not indicate when the 21-year-old Alexander would be released, but it is thought to be in the coming 48 hours.\n\nIsraeli media reported that US envoy Steve Witkoff will be in Israel on Monday as part of the deal.\n\nIt comes shortly before US President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East this week \u2013 which does not include a trip to Israel. Trump and Witkoff have frequently mentioned Alexander by name in the past few months.\n\nIn its statement on Sunday, Hamas said it was willing to \u201cimmediately begin intensive negotiations\u201d that could lead to an agreement to end the war and would see Gaza under a technocratic and independent administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis will ensure calm and stability for many years, along with reconstruction and the end of the blockade,\u201d the group said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Trump administration.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said on Sunday that the US told Israel that Hamas\u2019 freeing of Alexander would lead to negotiations for the release of more captives. The statement added that Israel\u2019s policy hasn\u2019t changed: negotiations will be conducted under fire with a continued commitment to achieving all war objectives.\n\nAlexander, who grew up in the US, was taken from his military base during the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, two Hamas officials told the AFP news agency that talks were ongoing in the Qatari capital of Doha with the US and reported \u201cprogress\u201d had been made.\n\nOne Hamas official, speaking about the talks with the US, said there was \u201cprogress made \u2026 notably on the entry of aid to the Gaza Strip\u201d and the potential exchange of captives for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.\n\nA second official also reported progress \u201con the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip\u201d.\n\nIsrael shattered the last ceasefire, which lasted two months, on March 18, launching a major offensive in Gaza and ramping up its bombardment of the territory.\n\nIt has also cut off all aid to Gaza since March 2, saying it would pressure Hamas to release the remaining captives. None have been released since the fleeting truce earlier this year when several were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarvation has taken hold across Gaza due to the Israeli blockade.\n\nEarlier this month, the Israeli government approved plans to expand its offensive in the Gaza Strip, with officials talking of retaining a long-term presence there.\n\nThe Health Ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that at least 2,720 people have been killed since Israel resumed its campaign, bringing the overall death toll since the war broke out to 52,829.",

        "body": "The White House reports $5.1 trillion in promised investments, with $4.3 trillion newly pledged. But experts say $2.1 trillion may not fully happen.\n\nSince returning to the White House, US President Donald Trump has touted corporate and foreign US investment announcements as proof he is ushering in \u201cthe golden age of America\u201d.\n\nOn January 21, Trump said that before he\u2019d finished the \u201cfirst full business day\u201d of his second term, the United States had \u201calready secured nearly $3 trillion of new investments\u201d.\n\nOn April 2, he said, \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re going to have about $6 trillion of investments\u201d. Six days later, Trump told National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner attendees that the investment total was \u201cnow revised up to about $7 (trillion)\u201d.\n\nDuring an April 30 NewsNation town hall, Trump speculated that \u201cit could be more than $8 trillion\u201d.\n\nOn May 4, Trump told Kristen Welker, the host of the NBC News programme Meet the Press, \u201cI think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country.\u201d\n\nOn May 6, Trump told reporters, \u201cI think the real number could be $9 or $10 trillion.\u201d\n\nFinally, on May 8, Trump said, \u201cWe have now close to $10 trillion \u2014 think of that, $10 trillion\u201d in investments. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about essentially two months.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s far beyond the figures the White House has released publicly.\n\nWe tallied the White House\u2019s public lists of investments; they amount to $2.1 trillion in corporate investments, or at most $5.1 trillion when including promised investments from other countries. Experts cautioned that the promised corporate investments are not guaranteed to materialise in full, or during Trump\u2019s presidency, and some of them would have occurred regardless of who was president.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the first to overstate new investments on his watch. Outgoing US President Joe Biden said in 2024 that his bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act had attracted $640bn in private investments; economists told PolitiFact that Biden\u2019s numbers were based on what companies had announced, which is not the same as dollars already spent.\n\nRoman V Yampolskiy, a University of Louisville professor and a specialist in artificial intelligence, which dominates the promised investments Trump cited, said, \u201cHistorically, large-scale investment announcements often overpromise and underdeliver. There is a performative element to them, especially in politically charged contexts. They function as political theatre as much as economic commitment.\u201d\n\nWhite House lists do not match Trump\u2019s words\n\nSince Trump\u2019s inauguration, the White House has publicised investment announcements from three countries and roughly 60 companies on its website, including in a \u201cnon-comprehensive running list\u201d. Many of the highest-dollar corporate announcements were in March and April.\n\nCorporate announcements in the White House\u2019s lists total approximately $2.1 trillion worth of US investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House separately has cited commitments from the United Arab Emirates to invest $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years; from Japan to \u201cboost\u201d its investment in the US to $1 trillion; and from Saudi Arabia to invest $600bn in the US during Trump\u2019s presidency. Combined with the corporate announcements, these bring the total to about $5.1 trillion, $4.9 trillion short of Trump\u2019s figure.\n\nBut the $5.1 trillion total has caveats. For example, the White House said \u201cJapan announced a $1 trillion investment in the US\u201d, but the article it linked said in 2023, Japan\u2019s US investment was $783.3bn and Japan would \u201cboost\u201d that to $1 trillion. That\u2019s an increase of $216.7bn rather than a new $1 trillion investment. That would put the total value of newly pledged US investment at about $4.3 trillion.\n\nTrump\u2019s second-term White House tally of US investments\n\nThe White House figures can\u2019t easily be used for apples-to-apples comparisons. Some of the investments are planned over Trump\u2019s four-year term, others over five years or a decade. In one case \u2013 ADQ and Energy Capital Partners\u2019 planned $25bn investment \u2014 it isn\u2019t limited to US-based projects.\n\nThe White House declined to detail additional investments. A spokesperson pointed to federal Bureau of Economic Analysis data that shows a 22 percent increase in business investment in the first quarter of 2025, calling it a historic increase.\n\nHowever, experts cautioned this increase was shaped by businesses stocking up on inventory before Trump\u2019s tariffs take effect and said the increase is unlikely to be sustained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of the announcements are aspirational, experts say\n\nExperts told PolitiFact that each of the five biggest investments on Trump\u2019s list warrants some caution, because they might not reach Trump\u2019s cited dollar amounts or were not solely prompted by Trump\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cMany of these announcements, particularly those in the AI and semiconductor sectors, appear to be, at least in part, aspirational in nature,\u201d Yampolskiy said. \u201cThey serve a signalling function: to attract investor attention, shape policy discourse, and secure favourable regulatory or funding environments.\u201d\n\nThe five largest company investments collectively account for 82 percent of the dollar value on the White House\u2019s corporate list.\n\nFive companies accounting for the majority of new investment promises are:\n\nStargate\n\nThe Stargate Project is an artificial intelligence collaboration among OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, announced during a January 21 White House event. The White House values the investment at $500bn.\n\nThe company\u2019s official announcement says $100bn will be invested \u201cimmediately\u201d and that it \u201cintends to invest\u201d a total of $500bn over the next four years, a goal repeated by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son at the White House event.\n\n\u201cWhether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen,\u201d wrote John Higgins, chief economist at Capital Economics, an international consulting firm.\n\nEnrique Dans, who studies technology and policy at Madrid\u2019s IE Business School, said the $500bn figure is \u201castronomical \u2013 roughly 2 percent of US gross domestic product \u2013 and lacks clear documentation\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the White House event, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without you, Mr President.\u201d But Altman had been discussing plans for a $100bn investment 10 months before Trump won his second term, The Washington Post reported, including an Abilene, Texas, data centre that began construction in summer 2024.\n\n\u201cAI investments have been on a global trajectory driven by technological maturity and competitive pressure, especially from China,\u201d Dans said. \u201cAny US president would have seen a surge.\u201d\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia Corp, another AI company, said it plans to invest up to $500bn in US infrastructure over the next four years. Previously, Nvidia manufactured most of its chips in Taiwan.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely Nvidia would have moved any production to the US if it was not for pressure from the Trump administration,\u201d Gil Luria, an analyst with the financial services firm D.A. Davidson, told Reuters. However, Luria added, \u201cThe half a trillion number is likely hyperbole.\u201d\n\nDans said that although tax cuts from Trump\u2019s first term have benefited the company\u2019s focus on US-based efforts, \u201cthe core growth likely would have occurred anyway\u201d, regardless of the president.\n\nApple\n\nOn February 24, days after Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook, met with Trump, the consumer electronics giant announced it plans to spend \u201cmore than $500bn in the US over the next four years.\u201d\n\nAnalysts have expressed scepticism that this represents new investment. Dans called the investment \u201csimply more of what [Apple] already does,\u201d from \u201cday-to-day activities with thousands of suppliers in all 50 states to the operation of its domestic data centres, as well as its investments in Apple TV+ and other projects already manufactured in the country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a note to investors, David Vogt, an analyst with the Swiss-based bank UBS, wrote, \u201cCall us a sceptic. \u2026 We believe [the figure] lacks substance.\u201d\n\nIBM\n\nIBM announced April 28 plans to invest $150bn in the US, including more than $30bn in research and development on US-based manufacturing of mainframe and quantum computers.\n\nThis is \u201cnot clearly Trump-related,\u201d Dans said. \u201cIBM\u2019s strategy pivots have been under way since the 2010s.\u201d\n\nLuria said, \u201cWhile we believe IBM will continue to invest in the emerging area of quantum technology, the bombastic figure is more likely a gesture towards the US administration,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which makes semiconductors for computing and electronics, has pledged to spend $100bn in the US. Analysts said this number is the most well-supported among the investments that Trump cites. Although bringing semiconductor production back to the US began during Trump\u2019s first term, it was \u201cgreatly accelerated by\u201d Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, which prompted years of investment before Trump\u2019s second term, Dans said.\n\nOver the past five years, the company has spent at least $65bn on fabrication facilities near Phoenix, Arizona, funded in part by $6.6bn from the CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nOverall, Dans said, \u201cTrump might deserve some partial credit for setting a more aggressive tone on economic nationalism and supply chain reshoring, and for lowering the corporate tax reform, which did affect repatriation and some investment decisions. But most of these trends \u2014 the AI boom, the semiconductor reshoring, the cloud computing infrastructure \u2014 are long-term structural shifts that predate Trump and will continue regardless of who is in office.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said, \u201cWe have now close to $10 trillion, think of that, $10 trillion\u201d in investments. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about essentially two months.\u201d\n\nThe White House has pointed to investment announcements totalling $5.1 trillion, including $2.1 trillion from companies and the rest from countries.\n\nThat\u2019s at least $4.9 trillion short of Trump\u2019s figure, and these announcements represent future spending, some of which is planned over four years, five years or a decade.\n\nExperts said many of the dollar amounts are aspirational and that the investments announced might never be fully reached. They also said some of this investment would have occurred regardless of who was president.\n\nWe rate the statement false.",

        "body": "The victims were mostly children and elderly people, with an additional 28 injured.\n\nHeavy overnight floods have washed away several villages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, killing more than 100 people, according to local officials, in a nation suffering war and mass displacement.\n\nThe floods were triggered by torrential rains and surged through the Kasaba village, in South Kivu province, during the night of Thursday into Friday, regional official Bernard Akili told news agency AFP on Saturday.\n\nTorrential rains caused the Kasaba River to burst its banks overnight, with the rushing waters \u201ccarrying everything in their path, large stones, large trees and mud, before razing the houses on the edge of the lake\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cThe victims who died are mainly children and elderly,\u201d he said, adding that 28 people were injured and some 150 homes were destroyed.\n\nSammy Kalonji, the regional administrator, said the torrent killed at least 104 people and caused \u201cenormous material damage.\u201d\n\nSouth Kivu\u2019s provincial health minister, Theophile Walulika Muzaliwa, told the Associated Press news agency that rescue operations were hampered by a lack of services and a shutdown of telephone lines due to the flooding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSector chiefs, village chiefs and locality chiefs, who are also members of the local government, are on site. The only humanitarian organisation currently present is the Red Cross,\u201d he said.\n\nA local resident told AFP that some 119 bodies had been found by Saturday.\n\nSuch natural disasters are frequent in DR Congo, particularly on the shores of the Great Lakes in the east of the country, as the surrounding hills are weakened by deforestation. In 2023, floods killed 400 people in several communities located on the shores of Lake Kivu, in South Kivu province, while last month, 33 people were killed in flooding in the capital, Kinshasa.\n\nDR Congo has also been subject to decades of fighting between government troops and rebels in the eastern part of the country, which escalated in late January when the Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu state, in a rapid and surprise offensive.\n\nNearly 3,000 people were killed and 2,880 injured in the Goma offensive, worsening what is already considered one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises, with more than seven million people remaining displaced.",

        "body": "Kylian Mbappe scores all Real Madrid\u2019s goals in a 4-3 defeat as Barcelona place one hand on the LaLiga title.\n\nBarcelona have overcome a two-goal deficit and a Kylian Mbappe hat-trick for Real Madrid to claim a 4-3 win in El Clasico, edging them closer to the LaLiga title.\n\nBrazilian forward Raphinha scored twice for Barca on Sunday in response to a flying start by the visitors \u2013 which saw them storm to a two-goal lead after 14 minutes \u2013 at the Catalan club\u2019s temporary home at the Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium.\n\nThe victory extends Barcelona\u2019s lead at the top of the standings to seven points over second-placed Real \u2013 the defending champions \u2013 and with three matches remaining, one more victory will clinch a 28th Spanish league title for the Catalans.\n\nBarca earned a fourth consecutive victory over Real in all competitions this season and their second in less than a month in a chaotic match in which both sides showed their usual defensive weaknesses.\n\nHowever, Barca seemed a much stronger and well organised team overall, dominating possession and creating several chances that were denied by inspired goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who prevented Real\u2019s loss from being by a larger margin.\n\nBarcelona could secure the LaLiga title as early as Wednesday should Real Madrid fail to win at Mallorca. Regardless of Real\u2019s result, a Barcelona victory in their city derby against Espanyol on Thursday would guarantee the championship for the Catalans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMbappe opened the scoring from the penalty spot after he was fouled inside the box by keeper Wojciech Szczesny in the fifth minute, and he extended their lead with a quick counter nine minutes later from an assist by Vinicius Jr.\n\nHowever, Barcelona responded swiftly with Eric Garcia, Lamine Yamal and Raphinha all finding the net within 15 minutes to overturn the deficit.\n\nGarcia headed home from a corner in the 19th minute while Yamal scored the equaliser in the 32nd with another brilliant display of technique as he curled a superb shot from the right corner of the box just outside Courtois\u2019s reach and inside the far post.\n\nTwo minutes later, a mistake by Mbappe in the midfield gifted Barca the ball, and Raphinha launched a quick counter, giving his side the lead with a tidy finish past a helpless Courtois.\n\nReal thought they had earned a second penalty in the 43rd minute, but it was overturned due to an offside in the build-up. And one minute later, a costly error by captain Lucas Vazquez gifted Raphinha the goal that extended Barca\u2019s lead.\n\nBarcelona came back strongly in the second half and had several chances denied by a string of stunning saves by Courtois.\n\nThey were shocked, however, when Mbappe reduced the deficit in the 70th minute after a quick counterattack by Vinicius, who ran up the right side and put it on a plate for the France forward to complete his hat-trick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet last year\u2019s champions could not recover, leaving them on the brink of a season without silverware.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously very important to win today. It\u2019s great to have this game after the Champions League. I think it\u2019s already forgotten,\u201d Yamal told Movistar Plus after Barca were knocked out of the European club competition in the semifinals in a heartbreaking midweek loss to Inter Milan.\n\n\u201cSuffering is what makes you strong and what teaches you to correct the mistakes you make. They didn\u2019t create any clear-cut chances other than the goals.\n\n\u201cIt was very important to win today to get closer to the league title. We are delighted.\u201d\n\nReal manager Carlo Ancelotti, meanwhile, is set to come under increased pressure with rumours the former Real midfielder Xabi Alonso will replace him at the end of the season.\n\nThe Italian-born coach was in a pragmatic mood, however, about the result and his side\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cIt was an evenly played match, competitive and fought until the last second,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe could have scored the equaliser, but it is what it is.

        "body": "A ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding, after both sides accused each other of initial violations, as an uneasy calm has taken hold following days of the worst eruption of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in decades.\n\nThe Indian military sent a \u201chotline message\u201d to Pakistan on Sunday about violations of an agreed-upon ceasefire, informing it of New Delhi\u2019s intent to respond if this was repeated, a top Indian army officer said.\n\nIndia\u2019s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) was speaking on Sunday as a fragile 24-hour-old ceasefire appeared to be holding after both sides blamed the other for initial violations on Saturday night.\n\nThe truce announced on Saturday halted several days of missiles and drones being fired at each country across their shared border, killing almost 70 people.\n\nDiplomacy and pressure from the United States helped secure the ceasefire deal when it seemed that the conflict was spiralling towards a full-scale war. Within hours of its coming into force, there were explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir, the centre of much of last week\u2019s fighting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities near the border under a blackout, similar to those heard during the previous two evenings, according to local authorities, residents and witnesses.\n\n\u201cSometimes, these understandings take time to fructify, manifest on the ground,\u201d Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai, the Indian DGMO, told a media briefing, referring to the truce. \u201cThe [Indian] armed forces were on a very, very high alert [yesterday] and continue to be in that state.\u201d\n\nThe Indian army chief had given a mandate to its commanders to deal with \u201cviolations of any kind\u201d from across the borders in the best way they deem fit, Ghai added.\n\nHe said his Pakistani counterpart called him on Saturday afternoon and proposed the two countries \u201ccease hostilities\u201d and urgently requested a ceasefire.\n\nThere was no immediate response to the Indian comments from Pakistan. Early on Sunday, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry had said that it was committed to the truce agreement and blamed India for the violations.\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire on Saturday, saying it was reached after talks mediated by Washington.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India and Pakistan had also agreed to start talks on \u201ca broad set of issues at a neutral site\u201d.\n\nWhile Islamabad has thanked Washington for facilitating the ceasefire and welcomed Trump\u2019s offer to mediate on the Kashmir dispute with India, New Delhi has not commented on US involvement in the truce or talks at a neutral site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia maintains that disputes with Pakistan have to be resolved directly by the two countries and rejects any third-party involvement.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump praised the leaders of both countries for agreeing to halt the aggression and said he would \u201csubstantially\u201d increase trade with them.\n\nHindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan each rule a part of disputed Kashmir but claim it in full, and have twice gone to war over the Himalayan region.\n\nIndia blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of the territory, but Pakistan says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.\n\n\u2018A tough night in border areas\u2019\n\nAmong those most affected by the fighting were residents on either side of the border, many of whom fled their homes when the fighting began on Wednesday, two weeks after a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam that India said was backed by Islamabad.\n\nPakistan denied the accusation.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Lahore, Pakistan, said it was \u201ca tough night for a lot of people in the border areas\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople said there was shelling in the early hours of the morning and throughout the evening, even after the announcement of ceasefire,\u201d Bin Javaid said.\n\nAlthough people are cautious, they\u2019re \u201cnot coming back yet to their homes because they believe that this is not over yet\u201d, he said, adding that there has been damage in several villages across the Line of Control.\n\nOverall, however, \u201cthere\u2019s jubilation and celebration,\u201d Bin Javaid added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Indian border city of Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs, people returned to the streets on Sunday morning after a siren sounded to signal the resumption of normal activities following the tension of recent days.\n\n\u201cEver since the terrorists attacked people in Pahalgam, we have been shutting our shops very early and there was an uncertainty. I am happy that at least there will be no bloodshed on both sides,\u201d said Satvir Singh Alhuwalia, 48, a shopkeeper in the city.\n\nAnother local resident noted the \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d throughout the Kashmir Valley since the ceasefire announcement.\n\n\u201cYou can feel it in the air \u2026 but there seems to be a bit of fear, as well. Will it hold, given the past history of both these nations?\u201d asked Muteeb Banday.\n\n\u201c[Kashmiris] want \u2026 long-lasting peace, so that we can go and live our lives, think about our future, make our lives better.\u201d\n\nIn some border areas, however, people were asked not to return home just yet. In the Indian-administered Kashmir city of Baramulla, authorities warned residents to stay away due to the threat posed by unexploded munitions.\n\n\u201cPeople here are hosting us well, but just as a bird feels at peace in its own nest, we also feel comfortable only in our own homes, even if they have been damaged,\u201d said Azam Chaudhry, 55, who fled his home in the Pakistani town of Khuiratta and has now been told to wait until Monday before returning.\n\nIn Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s Uri, a key power plant that was damaged in a Pakistani drone attack is still under repair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe project has suffered minor damage \u2026 We have stopped generation as the transmission line has been damaged,\u201d said an official from state-run NHPC, India\u2019s biggest hydropower company, who did not want to be identified.",

There was no immediate comment from the RSF on the army report.\n\nEl-Fasher is the last major city held by SAF in Darfur. For over a year, the RSF has sought to wrest control it, located more than 800km (500 miles) southwest of the capital, Khartoum, from the SAF, launching regular attacks on the city and two major famine-hit camps for displaced people on its outskirts.\n\nIn the meantime, Sudan\u2019s civil defence forces announced on Sunday that they have full control over fires that erupted at the main fuel depot and other strategic sites in Port Sudan, the seat of the army-backed government, which has come under daily drone attacks blamed on the RSF over the past week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fires caused by a drone strike on the fuel depot on Monday had spread across \u201cwarehouses filled with fuel\u201d, the Sudanese army-aligned authorities said, warning of a \u201cpotential disaster in the area\u201d.\n\nThe Red Sea port city had been seen as a safe haven from the devastating two-year conflict between the SAF and RSF before the drone strikes began on May 4.\n\nThe attacks have damaged several key facilities, including the country\u2019s sole international civilian airport, its largest working fuel depot and the city\u2019s main power station.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sudanese authorities accused the RSF of being behind the drone strikes. The RSF has not commented on the allegations.\n\nPort Sudan is the main entry point for humanitarian aid into Sudan. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the attacks \u201cthreaten to increase humanitarian needs and further complicate aid operations in the country\u201d, his spokesman said.\n\nSudan\u2019s army launched air strikes on the RSF in el-Khuwei in West Kordofan state and the state of West Darfur late on Saturday. El-Khuwei was captured by the RSF last week.\n\nActivists and Sudanese accounts shared a video clip on social media showing the Sudanese army and their allied forces announcing that they had regained control over el-Khuwei after battles with the RSF on Sunday, according to Al Jazeera\u2019s Sanad fact-checking agency.\n\nWitnesses also reported drone strikes on Sunday, targeting the airport in Atbara, a city in the northern state of River Nile.\n\nThe RSF has been battling the SAF for control of Sudan since April 2023. The civil war has killed more than 20,000 people, uprooted 15 million and created what the UN considers the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.",

        "body": "The US Constitution ensures all immigrants have due process, but rights depend on legal status and time spent in the US.\n\nIn a recent TV interview, United States President Donald Trump said he did not know whether he needed to uphold the US Constitution.\n\nTrump was answering a question on NBC News last week about whether undocumented immigrants in the US are entitled to due process.\n\n\u201cThey talk about due process, but do you get due process when you\u2019re here illegally,\u201d Trump asked the interviewer, Kristen Welker, NBC\u2019s Meet the Press moderator.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution says every person, citizens and noncitizens, deserves due process,\u201d Welker responded.\n\nShe then asked Trump whether he agreed with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said noncitizens are entitled to due process.\n\nTrump: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a lawyer. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nWelker: \u201cWell, the Fifth Amendment says as much.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cI don\u2019t know. It might say that, but if you\u2019re talking about that, then we\u2019d have to have a million or two million or three million trials.\u201d\n\nWelker: \u201cBut even given those numbers that you\u2019re talking about, don\u2019t you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. They have a different interpretation.\u201d\n\nThat was not the first time Trump had brushed aside immigrants\u2019 due process rights.\n\nIn an ABC News interview marking Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, correspondent Terry Moran asked Trump, \u201cBut in our country, even bad guys get due process, right?\u201d\n\nTrump answered, \u201cIf people come into our country illegally, there\u2019s a different standard.\u201d\n\nDuring a May 1 speech at the University of Alabama\u2019s commencement ceremony, Trump said, \u201cJudges are interfering supposedly based on due process, but how can you give due process to people who came into our country illegally? They want to give them due process. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nDays later, while announcing that the 2027 NFL (National Football League) draft will be in Washington, DC, Trump said, \u201cThe courts have, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, they said, maybe you have to have trials. Trials. We\u2019re gonna have five million trials? Doesn\u2019t work \u2026 Past presidents took out hundreds of thousands of people when needed \u2026 They didn\u2019t go through any of this.\u201d\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s dismissal of and questions about due process for immigrants, the US Constitution, legal experts and decades of court decisions agree: immigrants, regardless of how they entered the US, legally or illegally, have due process rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat those rights look like varies depending on how long a person has been in the US and what their legal status is.\n\nWhat are due process rights?\n\nDue process generally refers to the government\u2019s requirement to follow fair procedures and laws. The Constitution\u2019s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect \u201cany person\u201d against being deprived by the US government of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due process of law\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople have a right to be heard, and there are certain steps that need to be taken before someone can, say, be jailed,\u201d Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a lawyer and policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said.\n\nSeveral court rulings have determined that due process rights are extended to all people in the US, not just US citizens or immigrants in the country legally. The US Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act dictate the process the government must use to afford immigrants due process rights.\n\nIn immigration, due process generally refers to \u201cappropriate notice [of government action], the opportunity to have a hearing or some sort of screening interview to figure out, are you actually a person who falls within the law that says that you can be deported\u201d, Katherine Yon Ebright, a lawyer at the Brennan Centre for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security programme, said.\n\nFor example, if the government seeks to deport people who are undocumented, the government generally must give them a charging document known as a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d. Eventually, immigrants go before an immigration judge to present evidence and make a case that they qualify for some form of relief against deportation, such as asylum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout due process, legal experts say, US citizens could also be deported.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of due process is to determine whether you\u2019re the kind of person who can be subject to deportation,\u201d Ilya Somin, a George Mason University constitutional law professor, said. \u201cIf there is no due process, then the government can simply deport people or punish them at will \u2026 Because how can you show that you\u2019re actually a US citizen if you\u2019re not getting any due process?\u201d\n\nHow do due process rights differ for noncitizens compared with US citizens?\n\nEven though all people in the US have due process rights, for noncitizens, the specifics of the process and the extent of protections vary. The term noncitizen applies to people with legal documents as well as those without any documents, including people here on visas, with lawful permanent status or without a legal immigration status.\n\nThere is a \u201csliding scale of different protections that people can have depending on what their [immigration] status is\u201d, Yon Ebright said.\n\nNoncitizens are not entitled to government-appointed lawyers during immigration proceedings, for example. And some immigrants who recently entered the US without a legal document do not have to appear before a judge before being deported; these cases are subject to what is called the expedited removal process.\n\nUnder expedited removal, certain people can be quickly deported without a court case. However, people who express fear of persecution if they return to their home countries are referred to immigration officers, who determine whether the immigrant is eligible for asylum or other deportation protections. Immigrants who pass the \u201ccredible fear\u201d screening are referred to an immigration court where they can present their case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past, people were placed in expedited removal if they were within 100 miles (about 161km) of the border and within two weeks of their entry. In January, Trump expanded expedited removal for anyone who cannot prove they have been in the US for more than two years.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime power that Trump invoked in March, allows the government to deport \u201calien enemies\u201d. He has used that law to deport people his administration says are members of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua, without immigration court hearings. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of people under the law.\n\nHowever, the US Supreme Court ruled against the administration on April 7, saying it must give immigrants notice that they will be deported under the Alien Enemies Act, and give them \u201creasonable time\u201d to challenge the deportation in court.\n\nAlthough expedited removal and the Alien Enemies Act limit people\u2019s due process protections, they do not eliminate them. \u201cThere are no exceptions to due process,\u201d Bush-Joseph said.\n\nAdditionally, noncitizens who are charged with crimes receive the same due process protections as US citizens in criminal court, Somin said.\n\n\u201cAll of the protections of the Bill of Rights apply [in criminal court],\u201d Somin said. \u201cThere has to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt. He or she is entitled to a jury trial, rights against self-incrimination, right to counsel and so on.\u201d\n\nWhy are immigrants\u2019 due process rights making headlines now?\n\nThe Trump administration faces several court cases dealing with deportations and immigrants\u2019 due process rights. They include challenges over Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act and the government\u2019s mistaken deportation of a Salvadoran man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdministration officials have criticised judges and rejected immigrants\u2019 due process protections.\n\n\u201cDue process guarantees the rights of a criminal defendant facing prosecution, not an illegal alien facing deportation,\u201d White House adviser Stephen Miller posted on X on May 5.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s comments about due process are centred on his promise to carry out the largest deportation operation in US history. The administration\u2019s current deportation pace is below its goal of one million people each year, the Migration Policy Institute said in an April 24 analysis.\n\nNayna Gupta, policy director of the immigrant rights advocacy group American Immigration Council, said the Trump administration is attempting to \u201cget around those obstacles and those requirements\u201d of due process \u201cjust to meet some target [deportation] number\u201d.\n\nTo reach Trump\u2019s goal of one million deportations annually, the administration would need to deport people who have lived in the US for years and have no criminal convictions (whom past administrations have not prioritised for deportation).\n\nPast presidents were also required to uphold noncitizens\u2019 due process rights, but deportation processes moved more quickly under administrations that focused on people who had recently crossed the border illegally, Bush-Joseph said. That option is more limited for the Trump administration because undocumented immigration has reached historic lows under Trump.\n\nTrump is correct that deporting millions of people living in the US without legal documents would require millions of court cases, Tara Watson, director of the Centre for Economic Security and Opportunity at the Brookings Institution, said. That has long been the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMillions of immigration court cases are backlogged. And the Trump administration has fired several immigration judges who would hear these cases.\n\nThe administration\u2019s goal for mass deportation does not change due process rules and standards.\n\n\u201cIt is true that due process slows down the machinery of deportation, but due process is also what separates democracies from dictatorships,\u201d Watson said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said, \u201cIf people come into our country without documents, there\u2019s a different standard [for due process].\u201d\n\nAll people in the US, regardless of their immigration status, have due process rights, based on the US Constitution and decades of court decisions. That applies whether they entered the US legally or without any documents.\n\nFor noncitizens, people\u2019s due process protections vary based on their legal status or how long they have been in the US. Legal experts say, despite due process variations, there are no exceptions to due process requirements for immigrants.\n\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement False.",

several children and women, in Gaza as it continues to starve the besieged enclave.\n\nAmong the victims since dawn on Sunday were three Palestinians killed in a drone strike on a vehicle and two killed in a bombing near residential towers located west of Khan Younis in southern Gaza.\n\nAnother two people were killed in artillery shelling of a home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City in the north while the body of a man was recovered near the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza after Israeli warplanes bombed the area a day earlier.\n\nThe Israeli military also attacked the Islamic

fuel enter the territory for 70 days due to Israel\u2019s blockade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2.3 million residents of Gaza are surviving on fast-dwindling supplies and charity kitchens, which have been gradually forced to shut down as they run out of food and hunger spreads.\n\nThe United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) warned on Sunday that the longer the blockade continues, the more irreversible harm is being done to Palestinians.\n\n\u201cUNRWA has thousands of trucks ready to enter and our teams in Gaza are ready to scale up the delivery,\u201d the organisation said.\n\nHamas said in a statement on Sunday that Israel is committing a \u201ccomplex crime\u201d.\n\nIsrael\u2019s security cabinet this month approved a plan to fully occupy the Gaza Strip and force another mass displacement of Palestinians.\n\nIsrael has also proposed taking over any future humanitarian aid distribution, which would, it said, involve creating designated military zones.\n\nThe Humanitarian Country Team, a forum that includes UN agencies, warned that the plan is dangerous and would \u201ccontravene fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2013 as part of a military strategy\u201d.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Sunday that the country would accept a new US mechanism that would start delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nA group of American security contractors, former military officers and humanitarian aid officials is proposing to take over the distribution of food and other supplies in Gaza based on plans similar to those designed by Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plan has been criticised for bypassing the UN and aid groups with expertise in aid delivery and creating only four distribution points that would force a large number of Palestinians to travel to southern Gaza.\n\nAccording to the latest figures by Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health on Sunday, at least 52,829 Palestinians have been confirmed killed and 119,554 wounded by Israeli military attacks since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, which killed an estimated 1,139 people and resulted in more than 200 people taken captive into Gaza.\n\nPope Leo XIV called for an immediate ceasefire, entry of humanitarian aid and release of all those held in Gaza during his first Sunday blessing since his election as pontiff.\n\nIsrael to pay soldiers more before Gaza expansion\n\nThe Israeli military planned to intensify its ground occupation of Gaza on Sunday, pulling the Paratroopers Brigade back from its incursions into Syria to be redeployed to Gaza.\n\nThe paratroopers have been operating in the occupied Golan Heights and inside Syria since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in December.\n\nIsrael withdrew the Nahal Brigade from the occupied West Bank \u2013 which has also been under assault for months \u2013 in its intended and self-proclaimed push to \u201cconquer\u201d Gaza.\n\nBut thousands of Israeli reservists and other members of the Israeli military and security agencies, along with thousands of Israelis demonstrating in the streets, have been calling for an end to the war to bring back all captives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo address the growing dissatisfaction among soldiers, the Israeli government on Sunday approved a \u201ccomprehensive benefit plan\u201d for reservists worth about 3 billion shekels ($838m) that is slated to include a series of economic and social benefits.\n\nThe army welcomed the plan approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying in a statement that it is a reflection of soldiers\u2019 \u201cexceptional contribution\u201d to Israeli society.\n\nThis comes as United States President Donald Trump, who has reportedly had some differences with Netanyahu in recent weeks over the Gaza war and how to engage with Iran, will launch a tour of the Middle East this week.",

        "body": "Leo XIV, the first American pope, voted in past Republican primaries but is not formally registered with any party.\n\nHours after Robert Prevost became the first United States-born pontiff on May 8, social media discussions in the US speculated whether Pope Leo XIV, as he is known after the election, was a \u201cregistered Republican\u201d.\n\n\u201cSCOOP: Our Turning Point Action team pulled the voting history for Pope Leo XIV,\u201d conservative influencer Charlie Kirk wrote on social media platform X on May 8. \u201cHe\u2019s a registered Republican who has voted in Republican primaries when not living abroad. Our data shows he\u2019s a strong Republican, and he\u2019s pro-life.\u201d\n\nMany other X posts called Prevost a \u201cregistered Republican\u201d.\n\nPrevost, 69, is a registered voter in Will County, Illinois, and has cast ballots there over the past 13 years. In Illinois, voters do not register by party affiliation. But they declare a party when voting in a primary, according to an April video by the Illinois State Board of Elections.\n\n\u201cHowever, you are not tied down or formally registered to this party and are free to vote for another party at a subsequent election,\u201d the video says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Illinois voter registration application does not ask people to provide a party affiliation.\n\nThe Will County clerk\u2019s office sent PolitiFact Prevost\u2019s voter information, which lists his party affiliation as \u201cundeclared\u201d. It shows that he voted in the 2012, 2014 and 2016 Republican primaries. He voted absentee in the 2024 general election, with an undeclared party affiliation.\n\nThe viral screenshots Kirk and others shared on X are from L2, a paywalled database that aggregates consumer and voter data. L2\u2019s profile of Prevost lists \u201cRepublican\u201d in its \u201cparty\u201d field.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 New Pope is a registered REPUBLICAN! pic.twitter.com/bj8MH8H2Qs \u2014 Jared Small \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (@jaredsmall) May 8, 2025\n\nIt is unclear how L2 determines a party affiliation for people who live in states such as Illinois, where this information is not included in voter registration. L2 did not respond to PolitiFact\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBorn in 1955, Prevost grew up in Dolton, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. He was ordained as a priest in 1982, then moved to Peru, where he lived from 1988 through 1998. In 1999, he returned to Chicago to serve as the prior provincial of the Augustinian province of \u201cMother of Good Counsel\u201d, which covers the Midwest and Canada.\n\nPrevost\u2019s voter file lists his address to a house owned by his brother, John Prevost. We were unable to determine Robert Prevost\u2019s address or where he was registered to vote before 2012. In 2014, he returned to Peru and served as the bishop of Chiclayo from 2015 to 2023. He then moved to Rome, where he has lived since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS citizens who live overseas and meet certain criteria can vote absentee while abroad.\n\nWe contacted the clerk\u2019s office in Cook County, Illinois, where Chicago is located, to ask whether Prevost has a voter file in the county. The clerk\u2019s office directed us to submit a Freedom of Information Act request for that information; we did so, but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nElizabeth Shakman Hurd, chair of religious studies and political science professor at Northwestern University in the Chicago suburbs, said Prevost\u2019s voting history does not tell the public \u201cmuch about his views or positions other than that in that particular primary he was inclined toward one or more of the Republican candidates\u201d.\n\nOur ruling\n\nX posts said Prevost is a \u201cregistered Republican\u201d.\n\nPrevost is registered to vote in Illinois, where voters do not register with a party affiliation. However, they declare a party affiliation when voting in a primary. County records show Prevost voted in three Republican primaries from 2012 through 2016, the most recent records we obtained.\n\nStill, the Illinois State Board of Elections says when voters participate in primaries, they are not formally registered to a party.\n\nNo one is registered by party affiliation in Illinois, and evidence is scant about Prevost\u2019s voting history over his lifetime.\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.\n\nPolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this fact-check.",

The US currently has a 145 percent tariff on goods from China.\n\n\u201cChina makes 80 percent of all toys sold in this country and 90 percent of all Christmas goods sold in this country,\u201d former New York Times columnist Charles Blow said during a May 5 appearance on CNN\u2019s News Night with Abby Phillip. \u201cWe have a lot of leverage with China. The Christmas and the doll industry is not one of them.\u201d\n\nBlow told PolitiFact his source was an April 29 report in The New York Times. It said, \u201cFactories in China produce nearly 80 percent of all toys and 90 percent of Christmas goods sold in America.\u201d\n\nData shows those figures are rounded up, but not far off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlow\u2019s statement is \u201cdirectionally accurate but slightly overstated on toys\u201d, said Gilberto Garcia-Vazquez, chief economist at Datawheel, which operates an online economic data platform called the Observatory of Economic Complexity.\n\nHe said out of $41bn worth of imports in toys, games and sports equipment in 2024 by the US, $30bn, or about 73 percent, was manufactured in China.\n\n\u201cIf you include domestic production \u2013 small but non-negligible \u2013 China likely supplies closer to 72 percent of toys actually sold in the US, not 80 percent,\u201d Garcia-Vazquez said. The Observatory of Economic Complexity uses data sources from \u201cstatistical offices, open data portals or custom union websites\u201d.\n\nClaire Huber, spokesperson for the US International Trade Commission (USITC), provided PolitiFact with an analysis of 2024 data that showed 78.3 percent of toy imports and 85 percent of Christmas-related imports, such as lights, trees and decorations, are manufactured in China. The toy category includes dolls, wheeled toys and scale models.\n\nThe data was compiled using the USITC\u2019s DataWeb, which cites statistics published by the US Department of Commerce\u2019s Census Bureau, accessed on May 9.\n\nGarcia-Vazquez also analysed 2024 data for Christmas goods and said 90 percent of US imports in that category came from China.\n\nHe said Christmas lights are an exception because \u201cCambodia has recently overtaken China as the top source\u201d.\n\nThe New York Times published an April 27 report that showed 76 percent of \u201ctoys and puzzles\u201d and 87 percent of \u201cChristmas decorations\u201d come from China. Bloomberg, citing the trade organisation Toy Association, said \u201croughly 80 percent of toys sold in the US are made in China\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData shows 73 to 78 percent of toy imports and 85 to 90 percent of Christmas-related imports in 2024 came from China, supporting Blow\u2019s point that the vast majority of these goods come from China.

        "title": "India tried to project strength but ended up showing weakness",
        "body": "On May 10, United States President Donald Trump announced a \u201cfull and immediate\u201d ceasefire between India and Pakistan brokered by his administration. US media reported that, alarmed by intelligence signalling further escalation, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles drove urgent mediation. Vance warned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of catastrophic risks and encouraged direct talks between India and Pakistan.\n\nThe announcement of the ceasefire was received across the world with a sigh of relief. The spectre of a nuclear exchange, which according to one 2019 study could kill up to 125 million people in less than a week, had fuelled regional anxiety and spurred the US diplomatic frenzy.\n\nIn India, however, Trump\u2019s announcement was seen differently in some quarters. Former Indian army chief Ved Prakash Malik posted on X: \u201cCeasefire 10 May 25: We have left India\u2019s future history to ask what politico-strategic advantages, if any, were gained after its kinetic and non-kinetic actions.\u201d MP Asaduddin Owaisi wrote on the same platform: \u201cI wish our PM @narendramodi had announced the ceasefire rather than the President of a foreign country. We have always been opposed to third party intervention since Simla (1972). Why have we now accepted it? I hope the Kashmir issue will not be internationalised, as it is our internal matter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latter comment likely refers to Trump\u2019s statement that he is willing to work with India and Pakistan \u201cto see if, after a \u2018thousand years,\u2019 a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir\u201d.\n\nThe ceasefire announcement by the US president appears to have been perceived by some in India as a sign of the Modi government\u2019s retreat under US pressure while his offer to mediate on Kashmir is being seen as an indication that India\u2019s longstanding rejection of third-party intervention is being undermined.\n\nIn South Asian geopolitics, perception often outpaces reality \u2013 until reality bites. India has long projected regional dominance, bolstered by economic growth and nuclear might. Yet its actions in the aftermath of the April 22 massacre carried out by the Resistance Front (TRF) in Kashmir exposed its vulnerabilities. Intended to assert strength, India\u2019s response faltered, boosting Pakistan\u2019s regional standing and leaving Modi\u2019s government diplomatically weakened.\n\nOn May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle terrorist bases linked to groups like the TRF, which, it claims, is supported by Pakistan. Backed by French-made Rafale jets, the operation sought to project Modi\u2019s strongman image amid domestic outrage. Yet its success was contested. Pakistan reported civilian casualties, including children, while India insisted only terrorist sites were hit.\n\nPakistan\u2019s air force scrambled its own jets to deflect the attack and claimed it downed five Indian jets, including three Rafales. Two US officials confirmed to the Reuters news agency that a Chinese-made J-10 jet shot down at least two Indian planes, aided by Chinese intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) support. India has not acknowledged any losses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndian media initially claimed devastating strikes on Pakistani cities, including Karachi\u2019s seaport, but these reports, which were clearly part of propaganda efforts, were proven false.\n\nOn May 9, India launched missile attacks on Pakistani bases, including one near Islamabad, Pakistan claimed. The Pakistani army retaliated with short-range missile and drone strikes targeting Indian airbases at Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj. Indian air force officer Vyomika Singh reported Pakistani drones and munitions hit civilian and military targets.\n\nIndia\u2019s image as a regional hegemon frayed. The Indian government clearly overestimated its Rafale jets and underestimated Pakistan\u2019s Chinese-backed ISR systems, which enhanced battlefield precision.\n\nChina\u2019s military support for Pakistan has increased significantly in recent years. Since 2020, it has accounted for 81 percent of Islamabad\u2019s military imports.\n\nFor years, some Indian defence analysts warned that India\u2019s military was unprepared for a China-supported Pakistan, given its limited US or Russian backing for its high-risk Kashmir gamble. Others criticised the government\u2019s foreign policy for encouraging China-Pakistan rapprochement. Their warnings remained unheeded in New Delhi.\n\nThe events of the past few days exposed India\u2019s strategic limits, replacing ambiguity with global scrutiny. The kneejerk reaction in New Delhi may be to increase the defence budget and deepen even further the militarisation of Kashmir.\n\nAs the Indian government plans its next steps, it should do well to consider that the status quo of shadow war and the cycle of covert aggression fuelling unrest is untenable. Both nations\u2019 intelligence agencies have long backed proxies, driving instability from Kashmir to Afghanistan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe path forward rests on New Delhi and Islamabad making wise choices. Restraint, not rhetoric, should shape policies moving forward. Failure to do so risks geopolitical turmoil, economic stagnation and hardship for millions. Home to a quarter of the world\u2019s poorest people and more than 350 million illiterate adults, India and Pakistan cannot afford prolonged strife. Continued tensions could derail India\u2019s growth and cripple Pakistan\u2019s fragile economy, dwarfing any tactical gains.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.",

        "title": "What the Christians of the Holy Land expect from Pope Leo XIV",
        "body": "We hope to see in the new pope a father who will stand by our side and protect us from oppression.\n\nMany Christians of the Holy Land rejoiced at the election of Pope Leo XIV as the successor to Saint Peter. Many of us hope that the new pope will follow the legacy of his predecessor, Pope Francis, particularly with regard to issues of justice and peace.\n\nThe Holy See has historically played an important role in supporting the Christian presence in the Holy Land, whether through church activities, engagement with influential parties in and around the region, or through material and moral support. This has been reflected in the establishment of institutions such as the Pontifical Mission in Jerusalem, Bethlehem University, the Benedictus Center in Nazareth, and most recently, the donation by Pope Francis of the Popemobile to serve as a mobile clinic for children in Gaza.\n\nSome of the most impactful moments in our recent history have been papal visits to our land \u2014 starting with Pope Paul VI in 1964, followed by Pope John Paul II in 2000, Pope Benedict XVI in 2009, and concluding with Pope Francis in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe, Christians in the Holy Land, hope that Pope Leo XIV will not only come to visit us but also help address some of the challenges we face today in the birthplace of Christianity. As a community of 230,000 people, we are working to strengthen the Christian presence as an active component of the local society, in collaboration with its other components. However, we do need help.\n\nOne of the main issues affecting Christian lives in Israel and Palestine is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is a persistent source of regional instability that fuels violence in various forms, which kills many, including Christians.\n\nRising religious and political extremism makes many of us feel like strangers in our own homeland. Economic deterioration and the declining number of people coming for pilgrimage in the Holy Land due to the conflict are leading to a loss of livelihood and worsening socioeconomic conditions. Widespread despair is driving many to emigrate or plan to leave in the near future, dwindling the numbers of our community.\n\nMany local Christians want the Holy See to engage with key global and regional players to achieve a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In his last sermon, Pope Francis spoke about the urgent need for peace in Gaza. In his first sermon, Pope Leo XIV called for an immediate ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the Strip. We welcome these statements and hope he will continue to do his utmost to promote peace in the Holy Land.\n\nIn Palestine, the situation remains unclear due to the Israeli occupation of all territories meant to form a Palestinian state, the ongoing war in Gaza, and the limited authority of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank \u2014 not to mention Israel\u2019s full annexation of East Jerusalem. This reality calls for thoughtful action by the Church, both at the level of the Holy See and locally, to provide people with hope in these dark times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Israel, there is a pressing need for cooperation between the Holy See and the local church \u2014 bishops, priests, and believers \u2014 to resolve many issues that affect the Christian and non-Christian communities. It is crucial to work with all segments of the local society to pressure the state to treat all its citizens equally and preserve their dignity.\n\nChristians hope that the Holy See can collaborate with us in our efforts to achieve equality. We, as a community, face Israeli laws that discriminate against us based on ethnicity and religion; we need support in our efforts to have such laws repealed.\n\nIt is also essential to work towards resolving painful issues that have negatively impacted the Christian presence, such as the case of the villages of Iqrit and Biram, whose Catholic Christian residents were expelled before their homes were destroyed by the Israeli authorities in 1951. Since then, the residents and their descendants have been demanding to return to their ancestral lands, but are being denied this right.\n\nThere is also a need for stronger intervention by the Holy See to support Christian institutions operating under Israeli control, which face growing challenges, such as attempts by some municipalities to impose heavy taxes in violation of past agreements, the clear discriminatory underfunding of Christian schools by Israeli authorities, and threats against church property.\n\nMany Christians of the Holy Land also hope that Pope Leo XIV will work to enhance unity among them, including efforts to reach a unified date for major religious holidays, especially Christmas and Easter. They also call for increased joint efforts among churches to organise pilgrimages to the Holy Land that include not only visits to religious sites but also interactions with the faithful who live there. This is important because it would help us raise global awareness about the challenges we face and feel an integral part of the universal Church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a whole, Christians in the Holy Land, like their fellow Christians around the world, desire to see a father in Pope Leo XIV \u2014 a father who visits them and welcomes their visits, consults with them and listens to their concerns, protects them from harm, stands with them when they are attacked or oppressed, and follows in the footsteps of the Church\u2019s founder, who never hesitated to defend the oppressed regardless of how powerful the oppressor might be.\n\nPope Leo XIV should know that he has many children in the Holy Land who love him and understand how busy he and the Holy See are with so many issues around the world.\n\nIn the Holy Land, Christians have prayed \u2014 and continue to pray \u2014 for his success in his mission, fully aware of how complex it is. But above all, the children need their father \u2014 and that is what they expect the most: that he will always stand by their side, despite how busy he might be.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.",

        "body": "Foreign minister says civilian uranium enrichment cannot be subjected to any deal as Tehran and Washington set for more talks.\n\nTehran, Iran \u2013 A fourth round of indirect nuclear talks between Iran and the United States has concluded in the Omani capital, Muscat, with Iran\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs describing them as \u201cdifficult but useful\u201d.\n\nAfter about three hours of negotiations on Sunday, spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei described the talks as \u201cdifficult but useful talks to better understand each other\u2019s positions and to find reasonable and realistic ways to address the differences\u201d.\n\n\u201cNext round will be coordinated and announced by Oman,\u201d he said in a post on X.\n\nBefore the talks started, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media that Iran has a legal right to civilian enrichment of uranium that cannot be subjected to any deal.\n\nA landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, from which US President Donald Trump withdrew during his first term, allowed Iran to pursue its civilian nuclear activity but put restrictions on uranium enrichment to prevent Tehran from making a nuclear bomb.\n\n\u201cEnrichment is one of the achievements and honours of the Iranian nation. We have paid a heavy price for enrichment. The blood of our nuclear scientists has been spilled for this achievement,\u201d he said in reference to scientists assassinated by Israel over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Araghchi said Tehran remains committed to providing verifiable assurances that it will not be able to develop a nuclear bomb, which has been Trump\u2019s main demand.\n\nAraghchi visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar and met with senior officials to coordinate in the run-up to the latest nuclear talks.\n\nIn the Omani capital on Sunday, Iran\u2019s top diplomat was accompanied by his deputies and other members of the team tasked with technical talks that Iran still emphasises are held \u201cindirectly\u201d through Omani mediation.\n\nTehran has also repeatedly expressed concern over \u201ccontradictory\u201d remarks made to the media by US negotiators, who are led by Trump\u2019s longtime friend and envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Muscat talks, Witkoff again called for the complete \u201cdismantlement\u201d of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, including key sites in Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top officials have suggested Iran must import enriched uranium.\n\nThe fourth round of the talks was scheduled for early May but was postponed as Oman cited \u201clogistical reasons\u201d.\n\nThe delay came after the US did not confirm its participation and amid a string of major fires in several Iranian cities, including one caused by an explosion in the port city of Bandar Abbas that killed dozens of people and injured more than 1,200.\n\nTrump sacked National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, an Iran hawk, this month after Waltz reportedly coordinated with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and advocated for war with Iran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump, his team and Israel have repeatedly threatened to launch devastating military strikes on Iran and its infrastructure if the talks fail to produce results soon.\n\nMeanwhile, the US has continued to pile sanctions on Iran with the Treasury Department blacklisting a Chinese chemical group and three port terminal operators on Thursday in an attempt to target Iranian oil exports.\n\nAmid its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d push against Iran, the US has also promised to drive Iranian oil exports to \u201czero\u201d as Tehran has continued to ship its oil \u2013 mainly to China \u2013 despite the sanctions.\n\nTrump started the sanctions campaign in 2018 after unilaterally reneging on the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that put verifiable and stringent limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities in exchange for lifting sanctions on the country.\n\nThe accord restricted Iran\u2019s enrichment of uranium to 3.67 percent using first-generation centrifuges at limited sites, but it had time limits and sunset clauses that Trump claimed made it the \u201cworst deal ever\u201d.\n\nIran is currently enriching up to 60 percent, which is close to the more than 90 percent required to make a nuclear bomb, but the International Atomic Energy Agency said Tehran has made no effort to produce a weapon.",

The two countries have fought three wars over the region. They both stake a claim over Kashmir as a whole but control parts of it.\n\nIndia-administered Kashmir has seen decades of armed rebellion either for independence or a merger with Pakistan. New Delhi has deployed more than 700,000 soldiers to quash the rebellion.\n\nThe government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far remained committed to a decades-old policy of refusing international mediation to find a solution to the Kashmir issue. In 2019, Modi\u2019s government stripped India-administered Kashmir\u2019s semiautonomy, further alienating the Kashmiris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its response, Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Sunday that it appreciates Trump\u2019s willingness to resolve the Kashmir issue, which has implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond.\n\n\u201cPakistan reaffirms that any just and lasting settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute must be in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and must ensure the realization of the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, including their inalienable right to self-determination,\u201d it said.\n\nIndia\u2019s leaders have not directly commented, but Indian media quoted unnamed government sources as saying no decision has yet been made to engage in talks on anything beyond the ceasefire.\n\nIndia and Pakistan agreed to halt all fighting on Saturday, but Trump was the first person to announce the deal on his online platform.\n\nIn his post on Sunday, Trump took credit for the ceasefire.\n\n\u201cI am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great nations.\u201d\n\nThe latest fighting between the two neighbours started when India attacked Pakistan in the aftermath of a shooting attack in India-administered Kashmir\u2019s Pahalgam, which killed 26 civilians at a tourist location.\n\nNew Delhi again accused Pakistan of backing the \u201cterrorist\u201d groups that have launched many deadly attacks in India-administered Kashmir for decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPakistan strongly denies the charges, maintaining that India has supported \u201cterrorism\u201d in its territory for many years and the Pahalgam attack was a false-flag operation to start a war.\n\nThe missile, drone and artillery attacks signified the most serious fighting between the two countries since they became nuclear-armed powers decades ago.\n\n\u2018Neutral\u2019 site for talks\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday that in addition to the ceasefire, the two countries agreed to conduct broad talks over a host of issues at a \u201cneutral\u201d site soon.\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said his country believes in the path of peaceful negotiations to resolve problems around distribution of water resources and \u201call issues, including Jammu and Kashmir\u201d.\n\nBut India has for decades refused to hold negotiations over the contested region as it has tried to strengthen its hold over it.\n\nMohmad Waseem Malla, a research fellow at the International Centre for Peace Studies in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera that Trump\u2019s statement, though not entirely surprising, was \u201cstriking both in tone and substance\u201d and likely to raise concerns in New Delhi.\n\n\u201cAny suggestion of third-party involvement, even in passing, crosses a red line for New Delhi \u2013 especially under the current government, which has redefined the country\u2019s foreign policy and its emphasis on territorial sovereignty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that while Trump\u2019s mention of boosting trade and promoting peace may seem conciliatory internationally, India\u2019s domestic political climate and strategic priorities make it difficult to entertain such offers right now.\n\n\u201cThe key will be how New Delhi calibrates its response given current sensitivities.\u201d\n\nThe two countries also have yet to resolve their differences over water distribution as India\u2019s suspension of its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty remains in place.\n\nIn response to the Pahalgam attack, India also expelled Pakistani diplomats, military advisers and visa holders; closed its main land border crossing and suspended trade; and launched a manhunt for the perpetrators.\n\nPakistan responded by kicking out Indian officials and citizens, closing its airspace to Indian flights and threatening to pull out of the Simla Agreement, which underpins the Line of Control in Kashmir.",

(NASDAQ:ABNB) stands against other best stocks to buy according to Jim Simons\u2019 Renaissance Technologies.\n\nEven after his passing in 2024, billionaire investor and mathematician Jim Simons remains known as the \u201cQuant King\u201d of hedge funds due to the extraordinary success of Renaissance Technologies, his quantitative trading firm based in New York. After years of researching the finance industry, Simons realized the untapped potential of employing quantitative analysis to capitalize on market inefficiencies. This insight led him to develop a data-driven investment strategy of analyzing market behavior solely using statistical and mathematical models. By identifying subtle, non-random patterns in financial data, the quant genius predicted future stock movements and generated impressive returns.\n\nAlthough it is closed to outside investors, Jim Simons\u2019 secretive Medallion hedge fund, a flagship of Renaissance, has produced ground-breaking results since its inception. The Medallion Fund raked in impressive returns of 56.6% and 74.6% during the early 2000s dot-com crash and the global financial crisis between 2007 and 2011. The fund has maintained a substantial annual return of 31.5% since its first two years of operation. At the time of his death, Simons was worth $31.4 billion, ranking him among the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals, thanks to the strong market performance of the Medallion Fund and Renaissance.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire David Einhorn\u2019s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential and Billionaire Michael Platt\u2019s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential.\n\nRenaissance Technologies\u2019 computer-driven powerhouse came off to a great start after a stellar performance in 2024. The Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha Fund has gained 9.05% as of February, continuing to build on its impressive 2024 return of 15.6%, which was its best since its inception in 2021. Meanwhile, the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund has had its best start in over ten years, rising 11.85% in the first two months of 2025. Both funds are allowed to maintain sizable individual stock positions in addition to using stock index futures and options to help manage risk. However, the firm warns that it may be difficult to quickly unwind these sizable holdings without impacting market prices.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we picked stocks from Renaissance Technologies\u2019 13F portfolio as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. These equities are also popular among elite hedge funds.",

        "body": "We recently published a list of 11 Best Performing Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alignment Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALHC) stands against other best performing healthcare stocks to buy now.\n\nTrump\u2019s Healthcare Executive Order Brings a Win\n\nOn April 15, CNBC reported that President Trump\u2019s healthcare-focused executive order brought in a win for the sector. Trump directed his health department to collaborate with Congress to revamp a law allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. The announcement seeks to bring a change that the pharmaceutical company has lobbied for. Since the negotiation process is included in legislation, Trump\u2019s executive order cannot implement the change itself. However, it directs Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to join hands with Congress and change it.\n\nCNBC reported that drug makers have been working to delay the eligibility timeline for small-molecule drugs to be available for price negotiations by four years. This typically includes pills and most medications. This goes hand in hand with the 13-year wait until more complex biotech drugs are eligible for Medicare price negotiations.\n\nTrump\u2019s wide-ranging executive order also focuses on slashing healthcare costs. It comes a day after the administration instituted a national security report on the pharma industry. CNBC called the report \u201ca precursor to sector-specific tariffs.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Recession Resistant Investing: 10 Best Grocery Stocks To Buy Now and 11 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Hedge Funds.\n\nMedicare\u2019s negotiating powers have been a subject of contention, as drug makers have opined that they would suppress innovation and have rallied against the time frame for negotiation eligibility for most drugs. The law now allows the government to negotiate prices for drugs with no competition, which includes complex biotech or biologic medications after 13 years on the market, but 9 years for their administration as capsules and pills.\n\nAlthough they did not provide specifics, White House officials told reporters that other changes to the negotiation process would yield more savings than those attained during the first round under the Biden administration. While the Biden administration negotiated price cuts as steep as 79% for the first ten most expensive drugs to the Medicare program, the Trump administration would negotiate prices for the following 15 medications. This includes Pfizer\u2019s cancer drugs Ibrance and Xtandi, as well as Novo Nordisk\u2019s blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss treatments Ozempic and Wegovy.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bruker Corporation (NASDAQ:BRKR) stands against other Michael Burry stocks with huge upside potential.\n\nMichael Burry, founder and manager of Scion Asset Management, is best known for predicting and profiting from the housing bubble\u2019s collapse in the mid-2000s. His bold contrarian bet was famously chronicled in the book and film \u201cThe Big Short.\u201d Burry\u2019s investment strategy draws heavily from the rigorous market analysis and principles outlined in Benjamin Graham and David Dodd\u2019s 1934 book \u201cSecurity Analysis.\u201d The book championed the merits of financial statement analysis, highlighting the importance of intrinsic value and structured investment principles.\n\nThat said, Burry has never shied away from putting his own distinct stamp on Wall Street\u2019s time-tested principles. By utilizing complex financial tools, such as derivative securities and short-selling, Burry has amassed a fortune, challenging conventional market wisdom. His 2001 Scion Value Fund letter provides a fascinating insight into his contrarian outlook, which prioritizes long-term value over short-term price fluctuations. Burry makes it clear that to achieve significant long-term returns, he is willing to tolerate short-term volatility. He stated:\n\n\u201cI will always choose the dollar bill carrying a wildly fluctuating discount rather than the dollar bill selling for a quite stable premium.\u201d\n\nHe also has no qualms about making significant investments in a few stocks that he believes are undervalued, a tactic the investor employed to strengthen Scion\u2019s holdings at the end of 2024.\n\nIn the quarter that ended on December 31, 2024 just before DeepSeek\u2019s artificial intelligence breakthrough sparked a $1.3 trillion surge in Chinese tech stocks, Michael Burry offloaded some of his investments in the country\u2019s tech stocks. The moves came amid a period of high volatility for Chinese stocks, when investors appeared to be losing faith in Beijing following the implementation of a stimulus package in late September.

        "body": "We recently published a list of 15 Best Stocks to Buy According to Jim Simons\u2019 Renaissance Technologies In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other best stocks to buy according to Jim Simons\u2019 Renaissance Technologies.\n\nEven after his passing in 2024, billionaire investor and mathematician Jim Simons remains known as the \u201cQuant King\u201d of hedge funds due to the extraordinary success of Renaissance Technologies, his quantitative trading firm based in New York. After years of researching the finance industry, Simons realized the untapped potential of employing quantitative analysis to capitalize on market inefficiencies. This insight led him to develop a data-driven investment strategy of analyzing market behavior solely using statistical and mathematical models. By identifying subtle, non-random patterns in financial data, the quant genius predicted future stock movements and generated impressive returns.\n\nAlthough it is closed to outside investors, Jim Simons\u2019 secretive Medallion hedge fund, a flagship of Renaissance, has produced ground-breaking results since its inception. The Medallion Fund raked in impressive returns of 56.6% and 74.6% during the early 2000s dot-com crash and the global financial crisis between 2007 and 2011.

        "body": "Ramit Sethi is a well known money guru who isn\u2019t afraid to speak his mind. He is the bestselling author of the book \u201cI Will Teach You to Be Rich,\u201d as well as the host of the Netflix series \u201cHow to Get Rich.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Suze Orman\u2019s Top Tip for Building Wealth Is a \u2018Very Easy One\u2019\n\nFind Out: The New Retirement Problem Boomers Are Facing\n\nIn a recent newsletter, Sethi shared the biggest mistake people make when it comes to their money: letting money sit in a checking account. Instead, Sethi explained, it\u2019s important for people to invest their money.\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong: According to data from Charles Schwab\u2019s 2024 Modern Wealth Survey, 58% of Americans have investments. While that\u2019s a majority of the population, there is still a large percentage who don\u2019t.\n\nWhy People Don\u2019t Invest\n\nThere are many reasons why people decide not to invest. Primarily, in order to invest, people need to have extra money to allocate to investing \u2014 and not everyone has access to a job that automatically invests their money into a retirement account to make investing easier.\n\nA quarter of people currently live paycheck-to-paycheck, according to 2024 research from the Bank of America Institute. With the prices of everyday goods increasing, it can be hard for people to prioritize investing when they\u2019re trying to afford groceries.\n\nSome Fear the Risk\n\nAnother reason is that some people distrust the stock market and prefer to keep their cash on hand rather than risk losing it.\n\nHowever, Sethi explained to his followers that investing is how people become financially free. Because of inflation, the value of cash sitting in a checking account will erode over time, whereas with investing, money has the potential to grow and outpace inflation.\n\nFor You: How To Get a 10% Return on Investment (ROI): 10 Proven Ways\n\nInvest Money the Smart Way\n\nSethi recommended that people invest in target date funds or index funds, not hot stock picks. He explained that investing involves a long-term strategy, and that target date funds take much of the guesswork out. With these funds, people can choose the year they plan to retire, and the fund will automatically adjust to become more conservative as that year approaches.\n\nSethi also praised index funds, which are funds that mimic a particular index, like the S&P 500.\n\nWith an index fund, investors purchase a portfolio of stocks or bonds. That way, it\u2019s naturally diversified. If one company doesn\u2019t perform well, the fund still has several others to balance out the performance. Index funds also have lower expenses and fees, which can help investors to keep more of their money.",

        "body": "YouTube may answer most of your questions, but some content creators provide financial advice that will cause major headaches if you listen. Following advice from unverified sources about how to manage your money is risky. YouTubers want attention for their content and might stretch the truth to get it.\n\nRead Next: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You\n\nTry This: The New Retirement Problem Boomers Are Facing\n\nKeep reading as we\u2019ll debunk some of the worst YouTube financial advice videos and tell you what you should do instead.\n\nAre you more of a TikToker? Here\u2019s the worst financial advice on TikTok and what to do instead.\n\nInvesting Instead of Paying Off Debt\n\nVideos like this one by Life with Leah, offering advice to invest your money before paying off debt, can lead you into a financial hole if you\u2019re not careful. While the stock market generally returns around 10%, that rate is not guaranteed. Anyone choosing to invest with the hope of making 10% instead of paying off debt, such as student loans, takes the risk of the market not performing as expected. If you don\u2019t have a safety net to fall back on, the interest on your loans can accumulate quickly, leaving you in a worse position.\n\nFor You: How To Get a 10% Return on Investment (ROI): 10 Proven Ways\n\nInstead, be smart with your money and continue to make monthly payments on your loans. You can still invest while paying off your debt, but only use money you can comfortably afford to spare.\n\nStarting an Airbnb for Easy Passive Income\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen a YouTube video like one TheStayly made explaining how becoming an Airbnb host can make you an easy six-figure income, don\u2019t rush off to apply for a mortgage. Financing and managing any rental property is not the easy passive income people make it out to be.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to find the right property that fits your budget and can earn a decent return on your investment. However, there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll have enough renters to cover your mortgage payments throughout the year. You also need to consider that you\u2019ll be responsible for maintaining the property, including paying for repairs, which can eat into your profits.\n\nFor some people, buying (or renting) a property to rent out on Airbnb is manageable. However, if you would prefer something a little less risky while still passive, try investing in a real estate investment trust or through a real estate crowdfunding platform.\n\nBuying Crypto Meme Coins To Make Quick Money\n\nYouTube is flooded with creators like Josh Hupe pushing how to buy cryptocurrency meme coins for a high-risk, high-reward scheme. Meme coins are cryptocurrency tokens inspired by jokes or trends without any real underlying asset or purpose. Have they made some people money? Yes. Are they risky? Definitely.",

(NASDAQ:OPCH) stands against other best performing healthcare stocks to buy now.\n\nTrump\u2019s Healthcare Executive Order Brings a Win\n\nOn April 15, CNBC reported that President Trump\u2019s healthcare-focused executive order brought in a win for the sector. Trump directed his health department to collaborate with Congress to revamp a law allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. The announcement seeks to bring a change that the pharmaceutical company has lobbied for. Since the negotiation process is included in legislation, Trump\u2019s executive order cannot implement the change itself. However, it directs Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to join hands with Congress and change it.\n\nCNBC reported that drug makers have been working to delay the eligibility timeline for small-molecule drugs to be available for price negotiations by four years. This typically includes pills and most medications. This goes hand in hand with the 13-year wait until more complex biotech drugs are eligible for Medicare price negotiations.\n\nTrump\u2019s wide-ranging executive order also focuses on slashing healthcare costs. It comes a day after the administration instituted a national security report on the pharma industry. CNBC called the report \u201ca precursor to sector-specific tariffs.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Recession Resistant Investing: 10 Best Grocery Stocks To Buy Now and 11 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Hedge Funds.\n\nMedicare\u2019s negotiating powers have been a subject of contention, as drug makers have opined that they would suppress innovation and have rallied against the time frame for negotiation eligibility for most drugs. The law now allows the government to negotiate prices for drugs with no competition, which includes complex biotech or biologic medications after 13 years on the market, but 9 years for their administration as capsules and pills.\n\nAlthough they did not provide specifics, White House officials told reporters that other changes to the negotiation process would yield more savings than those attained during the first round under the Biden administration. While the Biden administration negotiated price cuts as steep as 79% for the first ten most expensive drugs to the Medicare program, the Trump administration would negotiate prices for the following 15 medications. This includes Pfizer\u2019s cancer drugs Ibrance and Xtandi, as well as Novo Nordisk\u2019s blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss treatments Ozempic and Wegovy.",

Despite this, Spotify\u2019s management has reaffirmed its goal of increasing gross margins by 2025, albeit at a more gradual pace with expected fluctuations throughout the year.\n\nIn the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE: SPOT) has also introduced Partner Programs that enable video podcast creators to earn money from their work in various revenue streams. As a result, creator payouts rose by a notable 300% in just one month, while the platform\u2019s video podcast consumption grew by more than 20%.\n\nBaron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) in its Q1 2025 investor letter:\n\n\u201cSpotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) is a leading global digital music service offering on-demand audio streaming through paid premium subscriptions and an ad-supported model. Shares were up, once again attributable to another impressive beat in gross margins and a healthy increase in operating margins.

Users continued to grow at a double-digit pace despite price hikes.

        "body": "The industrial sector is also experiencing a significant revival, with a 26% increase in 2024 driven by demand for reshored manufacturing, clean energy buildout, and infrastructure construction. With only a quarter of the $1.9 trillion in planned North American infrastructure projects underway, there is still enormous growth potential. At the same time, reduced interest rates are expected to boost housing activity, and aerospace demand is expected to rise as airlines revamp their aged fleets. These macroeconomic drivers continue to provide appealing entry points for cyclical names with long-term upside.\n\nThe background for these investments is especially attractive. Financial markets rebounded strongly in 2024, with financial equities up more than 30% by the end of the year, owing to lower inflation, lower interest rates, and strong investor sentiment. Even if the United States\u2019 GDP growth is expected to fall from 2.7% in 2024 to 1.5% in 2025, hopes of Fed rate cuts and a more stable regulatory environment are keeping financial industry momentum alive. Meanwhile, growing corporate refinancing needs and record-high consumer debt are steering capital into private credit and asset-backed lending\u2014areas where Highbridge has traditionally excelled.\n\nDubin has long been involved in basic research and multi-asset investing through Highbridge and his private investment firm, Dubin & Company. His portfolio demonstrates a high-conviction strategy, with the top ten holdings accounting for more than 40% of reported 13F equities. Dubin\u2019s top stock picks frequently coincide with broader macroeconomic themes, such as monetary easing, capital market expansion, and industrial revival, making them excellent bets for long-term investors looking for asymmetric risk-reward ratios.\n\nGlenn Russell Dubin is one of the industry\u2019s most experienced hedge fund managers, best known as the co-founder of Highbridge Capital Management , a multi-strategy investment business he founded with Henry Swieca in 1992. Before being bought by JPMorgan Chase in 2004, the firm quickly rose to prominence as one of Wall Street\u2019s most sophisticated hedge funds. As of March 2024, Highbridge Capital manages more than $7.1 billion in discretionary assets and has a focused exposure to growth industries.\n\nWe recently published a list of Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT) stands against Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s other stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTariff concerns have increased volatility in the equity markets, particularly in light of proposed higher tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. However, other investors see this as a temporary disruption that could eventually benefit domestic manufacturers and capital goods industries. In reality, leading market commentators argue that predictions of a fresh wave of trade protectionism are exaggerated, with underlying fundamentals remaining strong across major value industries.\n\nIn that scenario, this may be a good time to follow experienced managers such as Glenn Dubin. As markets reset and valuations in banking and industrial stocks decline from their 2024 highs, the opportunity to purchase into structurally good companies at a discount is wide open. Highbridge Capital\u2019s recent bets indicate trust in sectors that are not only rebounding but evolving, and these top stock picks might provide considerable upside as the market rebalances in 2025.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile a list of Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential, we studied Greenlight Capital\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings to identify billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s stock picks with the most upside potential. We evaluated the firms in ascending order of upside potential. These stocks are also popular with elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nSarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT): Among Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential\n\nA laboratory technician in a white coat holding a microscope and examining a vial of biopharmaceuticals.\n\nSarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nUpside Potential: 226.16%\n\nA commercial-stage biotech company, Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT) focuses on developing genetic medications for uncommon neuromuscular disorders. Its gene and RNA-targeted treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) include EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, AMONDYS 45, and ELEVIDYS. In addition, the company is developing siRNA-based therapeutics for other uncommon genetic illnesses and treatments for different types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD).\n\nSarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT) reported $612 million in total net product revenue for the quarter that ended March 31, 2025, a 70% increase from the previous year. ELEVIDYS drove the majority of growth, generating $375 million in revenue \u2014 a 180% increase year-over-year. The PMO franchise increased by 5%, adding $237 million. However, because of difficulties with the supply of ELEVIDYS, the company reduced its full-year revenue projection to $2.3\u2013$2.6 billion. Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT) would have generated a GAAP operating profit of $283 million and a non-GAAP operating profit of $334 million, excluding the $584 million R&D expense related to the Arrowhead collaboration.\n\nDespite strong demand, short-term momentum was hampered by operational delays and a patient safety incident. While no widespread safety issues were identified among the 800+ treated patients, a single case of sudden liver failure led to the rescheduling of infusions. The Q1 shortfall also stemmed from extended treatment timelines and mismatched site capacities. Approximately 60% of ELEVIDYS\u2019 revenue came from top-tier sites, which were at full capacity, prompting the company to shift patients to alternative locations.\n\nKey programs like SRP-9003 and SRP-9004 for LGMD have reached enrollment milestones and are on track for regulatory submissions later in 2025, reflecting continued pipeline progress. Readouts of Sarepta\u2019s siRNA treatments for FSHD1 and DM1 are anticipated later this year.\n\nOne of the largest holdings of billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s portfolio is Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), which accounted for 2.37% of his portfolio at the end of Q4 2024. The company continues to be one of the best biotech choices with enormous upside potential as it overcomes immediate obstacles and expands access to ELEVIDYS.\n\nOverall, SRPT ranks 1st on our list of Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of SRPT, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SRPT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "body": "The industrial sector is also experiencing a significant revival, with a 26% increase in 2024 driven by demand for reshored manufacturing, clean energy buildout, and infrastructure construction. With only a quarter of the $1.9 trillion in planned North American infrastructure projects underway, there is still enormous growth potential. At the same time, reduced interest rates are expected to boost housing activity, and aerospace demand is expected to rise as airlines revamp their aged fleets. These macroeconomic drivers continue to provide appealing entry points for cyclical names with long-term upside.\n\nThe background for these investments is especially attractive. Financial markets rebounded strongly in 2024, with financial equities up more than 30% by the end of the year, owing to lower inflation, lower interest rates, and strong investor sentiment. Even if the United States\u2019 GDP growth is expected to fall from 2.7% in 2024 to 1.5% in 2025, hopes of Fed rate cuts and a more stable regulatory environment are keeping financial industry momentum alive. Meanwhile, growing corporate refinancing needs and record-high consumer debt are steering capital into private credit and asset-backed lending\u2014areas where Highbridge has traditionally excelled.\n\nDubin has long been involved in basic research and multi-asset investing through Highbridge and his private investment firm, Dubin & Company. His portfolio demonstrates a high-conviction strategy, with the top ten holdings accounting for more than 40% of reported 13F equities. Dubin\u2019s top stock picks frequently coincide with broader macroeconomic themes, such as monetary easing, capital market expansion, and industrial revival, making them excellent bets for long-term investors looking for asymmetric risk-reward ratios.\n\nGlenn Russell Dubin is one of the industry\u2019s most experienced hedge fund managers, best known as the co-founder of Highbridge Capital Management , a multi-strategy investment business he founded with Henry Swieca in 1992. Before being bought by JPMorgan Chase in 2004, the firm quickly rose to prominence as one of Wall Street\u2019s most sophisticated hedge funds. As of March 2024, Highbridge Capital manages more than $7.1 billion in discretionary assets and has a focused exposure to growth industries.\n\nWe recently published a list of Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS) stands against Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s other stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTariff concerns have increased volatility in the equity markets, particularly in light of proposed higher tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. However, other investors see this as a temporary disruption that could eventually benefit domestic manufacturers and capital goods industries. In reality, leading market commentators argue that predictions of a fresh wave of trade protectionism are exaggerated, with underlying fundamentals remaining strong across major value industries.\n\nIn that scenario, this may be a good time to follow experienced managers such as Glenn Dubin. As markets reset and valuations in banking and industrial stocks decline from their 2024 highs, the opportunity to purchase into structurally good companies at a discount is wide open. Highbridge Capital\u2019s recent bets indicate trust in sectors that are not only rebounding but evolving, and these top stock picks might provide considerable upside as the market rebalances in 2025.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile a list of Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential, we studied Greenlight Capital\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings to identify billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s stock picks with the most upside potential. We evaluated the firms in ascending order of upside potential. These stocks are also popular with elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIonis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IONS): Among Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential\n\nA scientist in a laboratory making a breakthrough discovery in biotechnology.\n\nIonis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nUpside Potential: 80.19%\n\nThe commercial-stage biotech company Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS) is developing a pipeline of RNA-targeted medications. Its marketed treatments include familial chylomicronemia syndrome, hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. With the recent launch of TRYNGOLZA and the development of a solid royalty base from partnered drugs like SPINRAZA and WAINUA, Ionis has made the shift to independent commercialization. Additionally, the company has extensive clinical-stage assets that address rare neurological illnesses, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and hereditary angioedema. Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS) represented about 0.58% of Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s portfolio.\n\nRevenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, was $132 million, a 10% year-over-year increase, according to Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:IONS) earnings report. With an EPS of -$0.93 compared to the average of -$1.11, earnings exceeded expectations. WAINUA\u2019s $9 million and SPINRAZA\u2019s $48 million royalties helped non-GAAP operating losses drop by over 25% to less than $375 million. The company forecasted a strong year-end cash position of $1.9 billion and increased its full-year revenue outlook to $725\u2013750 million.\n\nDuring its first full quarter, Ionis\u2019s first independently marketed treatment, TRYNGOLZA, generated over $6 million in revenue. With Olezarsen Phase III results anticipated in Q3 for a possible sNDA by year-end and Donidalorsen awaiting FDA approval in August 2025, pipeline progress remained robust. Ionis is also moving several neurology-focused therapies, such as ION582 and Zilganersen, closer to Phase III development.\n\nStrategic partnerships with Biogen, GSK, and Sobi, as well as licensing income from deals like the $280 million sapablursen contract, support Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:IONS) projection of over $3 billion in peak yearly sales from its wholly owned medications. One of Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s best stock selections with significant upside potential is Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS).\n\nOverall, IONS ranks 2nd on our list of Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of IONS, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IONS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "body": "The industrial sector is also experiencing a significant revival, with a 26% increase in 2024 driven by demand for reshored manufacturing, clean energy buildout, and infrastructure construction. With only a quarter of the $1.9 trillion in planned North American infrastructure projects underway, there is still enormous growth potential. At the same time, reduced interest rates are expected to boost housing activity, and aerospace demand is expected to rise as airlines revamp their aged fleets. These macroeconomic drivers continue to provide appealing entry points for cyclical names with long-term upside.\n\nThe background for these investments is especially attractive. Financial markets rebounded strongly in 2024, with financial equities up more than 30% by the end of the year, owing to lower inflation, lower interest rates, and strong investor sentiment. Even if the United States\u2019 GDP growth is expected to fall from 2.7% in 2024 to 1.5% in 2025, hopes of Fed rate cuts and a more stable regulatory environment are keeping financial industry momentum alive. Meanwhile, growing corporate refinancing needs and record-high consumer debt are steering capital into private credit and asset-backed lending\u2014areas where Highbridge has traditionally excelled.\n\nDubin has long been involved in basic research and multi-asset investing through Highbridge and his private investment firm, Dubin & Company. His portfolio demonstrates a high-conviction strategy, with the top ten holdings accounting for more than 40% of reported 13F equities. Dubin\u2019s top stock picks frequently coincide with broader macroeconomic themes, such as monetary easing, capital market expansion, and industrial revival, making them excellent bets for long-term investors looking for asymmetric risk-reward ratios.\n\nGlenn Russell Dubin is one of the industry\u2019s most experienced hedge fund managers, best known as the co-founder of Highbridge Capital Management , a multi-strategy investment business he founded with Henry Swieca in 1992. Before being bought by JPMorgan Chase in 2004, the firm quickly rose to prominence as one of Wall Street\u2019s most sophisticated hedge funds. As of March 2024, Highbridge Capital manages more than $7.1 billion in discretionary assets and has a focused exposure to growth industries.\n\nWe recently published a list of Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) stands against Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s other stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTariff concerns have increased volatility in the equity markets, particularly in light of proposed higher tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. However, other investors see this as a temporary disruption that could eventually benefit domestic manufacturers and capital goods industries. In reality, leading market commentators argue that predictions of a fresh wave of trade protectionism are exaggerated, with underlying fundamentals remaining strong across major value industries.\n\nIn that scenario, this may be a good time to follow experienced managers such as Glenn Dubin. As markets reset and valuations in banking and industrial stocks decline from their 2024 highs, the opportunity to purchase into structurally good companies at a discount is wide open. Highbridge Capital\u2019s recent bets indicate trust in sectors that are not only rebounding but evolving, and these top stock picks might provide considerable upside as the market rebalances in 2025.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile a list of Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential, we studied Greenlight Capital\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings to identify billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s stock picks with the most upside potential. We evaluated the firms in ascending order of upside potential. These stocks are also popular with elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nON Semiconductor Corporation (ON): Among Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential\n\nA technician at a sophisticated computer hardware rig, emphasizing the company's chip-manufacturing capabilities.\n\nON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 52\n\nUpside Potential: 45.29%\n\nON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) is a major provider of intelligent power and sensing technology, serving the automotive, industrial, and cloud power markets worldwide. The company operates in three major segments: Power Solutions Group, Analog and Mixed-Signal Group, and Intelligent Sensing Group, offering semiconductor solutions for electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers.\n\nON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) announced $1.45 billion in revenue for Q1 2025, ending April 4, exceeding the midpoint of its guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.55, which was higher than expected, while free cash flow rose 72% year-over-year to $455 million, representing 31% of revenue. However, the gross margin fell sequentially by 530 basis points to 40% as a result of automotive sector deterioration and price changes. The company repurchased $300 million in shares, representing 66% of its quarterly free cash flow.\n\nLooking ahead, ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) anticipates Q2 revenue of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and EPS of $0.48-$0.58. The company expects strong growth in its industrial and \u201cother\u201d areas, with plans to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders and maintain a 25-30% free cash flow margin this year. These proactive efforts, together with a strong position in AI infrastructure and silicon carbide EV solutions, enable the company\u2019s long-term growth story.\n\nON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) is part of Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s stock portfolio, with a $53.39 million stake accounting for 1.99% of his total holdings, indicating a strong belief in the company\u2019s future growth prospects.\n\nOverall, ON ranks 5th on our list of Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin\u2019s stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of ON, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Electric car stocks consist of companies that primarily manufacture electric vehicles. The electric vehicle business also includes companies that provide parts for electric vehicles, including batteries or autonomous driving systems.\n\nS&P Global Mobility estimates that around 7.36 million of the 16 million cars sold in 2024 were not made in the United States, showing that President Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on imported cars, which have been in effect since March 2024, affect about 46% of the country\u2019s auto market. On May 3, tariffs on some auto components, including engines and transmissions, went into effect.\n\nHowever, the administration unveiled a two-year relief plan in response to industry criticism.

Automobiles having at least 85% U.S., Canadian, or Mexican components are exempt; by 2025, the percentage will rise to 90%.

China is the market leader, with EV sales forecast to jump by 40% to 11 million by 2024, and Latin America and Asia-Pacific will continue to dominate. Sales in Europe are anticipated to surge by 15% from 3 million units in 2024, even though there could be fines of \u20ac10 billion for missing emissions targets. Despite the uncertainties surrounding policy, U.S. sales have been projected to rise by 16%.\n\nRho Motion Head of Research, Iola Hughes, stated:\n\n\u201cIn the US market, a lot of uncertainty has obviously hit the market in the last year or so, and we are expecting reduced EV forecasts,\u201d \u201cHowever, the shift to electric vehicles is still very much happening and we will still see growth over the next decade.\u201d\n\n10 High-Growth EV Stocks to Invest In\n\nA close-up of a luxury electric sports sedan, its sleek body reflecting the energy of progress.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we sifted through the online rankings to form an initial list of the 20 EV stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with an average 5-year revenue growth of over 20%.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nXPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV)\n\nAverage 5-Year Revenue Growth: 77.47%\n\nChina\u2019s top producer of electric vehicles, XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV), targets tech-savvy consumers in the mid- to high-end market. Eight pure electric models are currently being mass-produced: the X9 multipurpose vehicle, the Mona 03 tiny sedan, the G3/G3i compact sport utility vehicle, or SUV, the P7 midsize sedan, the P5 compact sedan, the G9 midsize SUV, the G6 compact SUV, and the P7 midsize sedan. Popular trims with a driving range of roughly 460-700 km have retail prices ranging from CNY 120,000 to CNY 420,000. The company plans to introduce a minimum of ten new automobiles for its pipeline of new models between 2025 and 2027.\n\nXPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) revealed the April vehicle delivery results. The firm delivered 35,045 Smart EVs in April, exceeding 30,000 units for the sixth consecutive month and representing a 273% year-over-year increase. Over 100,000 XPeng Mona M03 units had been delivered overall. Five months after its launch, the XPeng P7+ reached its 50,000th milestone in vehicle production. The business supplied 129,053 Smart EVs in the first four months of 2025, a 313% increase over the same time last year.\n\nXPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) is on course to become the world\u2019s first mass producer of flying autos by 2026, according to its unique \u201cland aircraft carrier\u201d concept, which combines a six-wheeled van with a detachable passenger drone. This innovation enables customers to drive to a takeoff location, detach the drone, and continue their journey airborne, decreasing travel time and enhancing accessibility. At the 2024 Zhuhai Airshow, the business displayed their flying car and received more than 3,000 intended orders. A new plant will start producing 10,000 units annually by early 2026, placing the company at the forefront of this revolutionary industry.\n\nOverall, XPEV ranks 3rd on our list of the High Growth EV Stocks to Invest In. While we acknowledge the potential of XPEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

China is the market leader, with EV sales forecast to jump by 40% to 11 million by 2024, and Latin America and Asia-Pacific will continue to dominate. Sales in Europe are anticipated to surge by 15% from 3 million units in 2024, even though there could be fines of \u20ac10 billion for missing emissions targets. Despite the uncertainties surrounding policy, U.S. sales have been projected to rise by 16%.\n\nRho Motion Head of Research, Iola Hughes, stated:\n\n\u201cIn the US market, a lot of uncertainty has obviously hit the market in the last year or so, and we are expecting reduced EV forecasts,\u201d \u201cHowever, the shift to electric vehicles is still very much happening and we will still see growth over the next decade.\u201d\n\n10 High-Growth EV Stocks to Invest In\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we sifted through the online rankings to form an initial list of the 20 EV stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with an average 5-year revenue growth of over 20%.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nAverage 5-Year Revenue Growth: 29.76%\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of electric vehicles. The majority of the US EV industry is currently owned by the most successful automaker in the world, which was the first to produce \u201cpremium electric vehicles.\u201d Investors unquestionably have high expectations for CEO Elon Musk and his team, which includes full self-driving technology, robotaxis, and further EV sales. In 2024, the company delivered just under 1.8 million electric vehicles due to its first-mover advantage in the market, and it continued to hold its top spot as the industry leader in most categories. It is one of the EV companies with an average 5-year revenue growth of 29.76%, making it among the High Growth Stocks.\n\nOn May 6, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) released the Model Y, a cheaper long-range rear-wheel drive vehicle, in the United States. It cost $44,990 before a $7,500 tax credit. Delivery is anticipated in roughly a month, and the price decreases to $37,490 after the credit. In the face of growing competition, the move is intended to increase sales. The firm\u2019s stock rose more than 1% following the announcement.\n\nOn April 28, Cantor Fitzgerald set a price target of $355 and reiterated its Overweight rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Despite the stock\u2019s 27% drop this year, the firm remains bullish, citing its strong financial position and ambitious future goals, including Robotaxis, a $30,000 model in 2025, and full self-driving growth. The investment business sees the current downturn as an opportunity for patient investors to purchase, and it believes that its robotics, energy storage, and artificial intelligence will all grow in the long run.\n\nOverall, TSLA ranks 6th on our list of the High Growth EV Stocks to Invest In. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

China is the market leader, with EV sales forecast to jump by 40% to 11 million by 2024, and Latin America and Asia-Pacific will continue to dominate. Sales in Europe are anticipated to surge by 15% from 3 million units in 2024, even though there could be fines of \u20ac10 billion for missing emissions targets. Despite the uncertainties surrounding policy, U.S. sales have been projected to rise by 16%.\n\nRho Motion Head of Research, Iola Hughes, stated:\n\n\u201cIn the US market, a lot of uncertainty has obviously hit the market in the last year or so, and we are expecting reduced EV forecasts,\u201d \u201cHowever, the shift to electric vehicles is still very much happening and we will still see growth over the next decade.\u201d\n\n10 High-Growth EV Stocks to Invest In\n\nA team of scientists in a laboratory observing the sophisticated engineering of specialty chemicals.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we sifted through the online rankings to form an initial list of the 20 EV stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with an average 5-year revenue growth of over 20%.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)\n\nAverage 5-Year Revenue Growth: 7.82%\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is the largest and most renowned producer of lithium, a key raw material used in electric vehicle batteries. The company is one of the world\u2019s largest lithium miners, with a production capacity of 225,000 metric tons, and it plans to nearly triple output by 2030. The supply chain challenges for lithium are complicated, and in 2025, trade regulations could make things even more challenging. However, since lithium is a commodity stock that benefits from broad market-wide pricing trends, any shortages or supply constraints would inevitably result in higher lithium prices if things do not work out, which will improve the company\u2019s bottom line. It is among High Growth Stocks with an average 5-year revenue growth of 7.82%.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) reported record lithium output from its integrated conversion network, showing strong operational and financial success and solidifying its position as a major facilitator of the global energy revolution. The business made $545 million in operating cash, and its remarkable operating cash conversion rate of more than 200% demonstrated effective capital usage.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) also achieved around 90% of the desired run rate, making significant progress on its $350 million cost and productivity improvement program. The long-term forecast is still positive, as the increasing need for grid storage and the rapid uptake of electric vehicles are expected to more than double the world\u2019s lithium consumption between 2024 and 2030. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA climbed 30% in Specialties and 76% in Ketjen year over year, showing solid performance and diverse growth, pointing to a considerable improvement in profitability across business areas.\n\nOverall, ALB ranks 9th on our list of the High Growth EV Stocks to Invest In. While we acknowledge the potential of ALB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ALB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\n\nAverage 5-Year Revenue Growth: 6.89%\n\nAn American multinational automaker, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) deals in trucks, cars, and auto components in addition to software-based services and subscriptions. The company has engaged in numerous share buybacks in recent years, resulting in a significant reduction in its shares. The stock\u2019s performance was significantly impacted by the company\u2019s announcement of $16 billion in buybacks between 2023 and 2025. GM also initiated an accelerated share repurchase program to quickly implement $2 billion of a new $6 billion authorization for share repurchases. It has an average 5-year revenue growth of 6.89%, making it one of the High Growth Stocks.\n\nIn Q1 of 2025, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) delivered an 8.8% margin in North America and showed great progress on several fronts, beating all of its key competitors and gaining over two full percentage points of U.S. market share year over year. Cadillac EVs accounted for 20% of domestic sales, helping the company\u2019s electric vehicle division soar, with over 90% year-over-year growth, making the firm the second-largest EV manufacturer in the United States. Another example of its operational resilience was how quickly it handled a supply chain disruption brought on by a supplier factory fire, affecting only 7,000 units, all of which were anticipated to be restored in Q2. By increasing its direct purchases for North American production by 27% since 2019, it has strengthened its domestic manufacturing footprint and achieved over 80% USMCA compliance in vehicles built in the United States.\n\nThe company is also adding innovative technologies to its vehicles.

        "body": "Find out how much you could earn by locking in a high CD rate today. A certificate of deposit (CD) allows you to lock in a competitive rate on your savings and help your balance grow. However, rates vary widely across financial institutions, so it\u2019s important to ensure you\u2019re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a CD. The following is a breakdown of CD rates today and where to find the best offers.\n\nOverview of CD rates today\n\nHistorically, longer-term CDs offered higher interest rates than shorter-term CDs. Generally, this is because banks would pay better rates to encourage savers to keep their money on deposit longer. However, in today\u2019s economic climate, the opposite is true.\n\nToday, the highest CD rate 4.40% APY, offered by Marcus by Goldman Sachs on its 14-month CD. There is a $500 minimum opening deposit required.\n\nNexBank also offers 4.40% APY on its 1-year CD. However, a minimum deposit of $25,000 is required.\n\nHere is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners:\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nHow much interest can I earn with a CD?\n\nThe amount of interest you can earn from a CD depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (CD interest typically compounds daily or monthly).\n\nSay you invest $1,000 in a one-year CD with 1.81% APY, and interest compounds monthly. At the end of that year, your balance would grow to $1,018.25 \u2014 your initial $1,000 deposit, plus $18.25 in interest.\n\nNow let\u2019s say you choose a one-year CD that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.74 over the same period, which includes $40.74 in interest.\n\nThe more you deposit in a CD, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a one-year CD at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance when the CD matures would be $10,407.42, meaning you\u2019d earn $407.42 in interest. \u200b\u200b\n\nRead more: What is a good CD rate?\n\nTypes of CDs\n\nWhen choosing a CD, the interest rate is usually top of mind. However, the rate isn\u2019t the only factor you should consider. There are several types of CDs that offer different benefits, though you may need to accept a slightly lower interest rate in exchange for more flexibility. Here\u2019s a look at some of the common types of CDs you can consider beyond traditional CDs:\n\nBump-up CD : This type of CD allows you to request a higher interest rate if your bank's rates go up during the account\u2019s term. However, you\u2019re usually allowed to \"bump up\" your rate just once.\n\nNo-penalty CD : Also known as a liquid CD, type of CD gives you the option to withdraw your funds before maturity without paying a penalty.\n\nJumbo CD : These CDs require a higher minimum deposit (usually $100,000 or more), and often offer higher interest rate in return. In today\u2019s CD rate environment, however, the difference between traditional and jumbo CD rates may not be much.\n\nBrokered CD: As the name suggests, these CDs are purchased through a brokerage rather than directly from a bank. Brokered CDs can sometimes offer higher rates or more flexible terms, but they also carry more risk and might not be FDIC-insured.",

        "body": "Key Points\n\nBP's underperformance and strategy shifts have made it a potential takeover target.\n\nShell, Chevron, Exxon, TotalEnergies, and others have looked into acquiring the oil company.\n\nA takeover of BP might be difficult.\n\n10 stocks we like better than BP \u203a\n\nA consolidation wave has washed over the oil patch in recent years. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) kicked things off with its $64.5 billion deal for Pioneer Natural Resources in late 2023. Chevron (NYSE: CVX) followed with a megadeal of its own, agreeing to buy Hess for $60 billion in a deal it hopes to close this summer. Several other oil companies have joined the merger wave by making smaller deals.\n\nAfter a calm in recent months, a potentially massive deal could be brewing. Several oil companies have run the numbers on buying BP (NYSE: BP). Here's why it has become a takeover target and what big oil companies might buy the oil stock.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nShifting strategy\n\nBP has struggled in recent years. The British oil giant has undergone two significant strategy shifts. In 2020, the company pledged to cut capital spending on oil and gas projects, which would steadily reduce its production by 40%. It aimed to shift that spending toward rapidly growing its clean energy businesses.\n\nHowever, a recovery in oil prices and years of underperformance led the oil giant to shift gears on its strategy again earlier this year. It's slashing spending on renewables from a plan to invest $5 billion annually to a $1.5 billion to $2 billion yearly level.\n\nMeanwhile, it's boosting its oil and gas capital investment plan to $10 billion per year. As a result, BP will grow its renewable business much more slowly while increasing its overall oil and gas output to an average of 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day by 2030, up from less than 2.4 million BOE last year.\n\nBP's abrupt strategy shifts have it searching for an identity. It stands in stark contrast to U.S. oil giants Exxon and Chevron, which have well-defined multiyear strategies for growing shareholder value. For example, Exxon plans to invest $140 billion in developing its advantaged assets (lower cost and higher margin) while stripping out billions of structural costs. This plan has the oil giant on track to add an incremental $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in free cash flow by 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, Chevron is also investing heavily in growing its advantaged assets, which will drive industry-leading free-cash-flow growth of as much as $10 billion by 2026. Both oil companies are also investing strategically to grow their lower-carbon energy platforms, focusing on investments that can earn attractive returns, like carbon capture and storage, biofuels, and hydrogen.",

        "title": "AI Stocks Face 'Show Me' Moment. CoreWeave Earnings On Tap.",
        "body": "The big run of artificial intelligence stocks has taken a breather in 2025 but a couple of plays are hanging in there, such as Palantir Technologies (PLTR). While semiconductor stocks ruled as the best AI stocks early on, there could be new options emerging.\n\nTo be sure, top AI stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) face high expectations. For many companies \u2014 such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) \u2014 the rise of generative AI poses both risk and opportunity.\n\nAmid the rise of generative AI \u2014 which generates text, images, and video \u2014 it's a good time to be cautious amid the hype, especially given recent developments at Super Micro Computer (SMCI).\n\nMany companies suddenly tout AI product roadmaps. In general, look for AI stocks that use artificial intelligence to improve products or gain a strategic edge.\n\nCoreWeave Earnings Due\n\nNvidia-backed CoreWeave (CRWV), which recently launched an initial public offering, reports earnings for the first time as a public company on May 14. CoreWeave is a new AI cloud services provider that rents out Nvidia GPU-equipped servers. Here's a look at Wall Street analyst views on CRWV stock.\n\nWhat's more, data analytics software maker Palantir reported first quarter earnings on May 5. Palantir stock has gained 55% in 2025 after soaring 340% last year. Palantir belongs to the IBD Leaderboard.\n\nWhile software companies have been slow to monetize AI products, some analysts still expect long-term gains. RBC Capital puts AI stocks into four categories. They include: 1) large incumbent vendors that can leverage their data and distribution to take advantage of the technology; 2) vertical software leaders that have not just significant data, but also the ability to verticalize GenAI solutions to accelerate the winner-take-all dynamics of vertical software; 3) mid-market challengers that can use GenAI as an innovation engine to narrow the gap with market leaders; and 4) companies that enable GenAI for others.\n\nAmong data center infrastructure plays, Arista Networks (ANET) reported earnings on May 6.\n\nAI Stocks: Meta Five Pillars Of Growth\n\nMeanwhile, Meta stock has gained 1% in 2025. On Meta's Q1 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out five pillars of expected AI growth. They include improved advertising, engaging social media experiences, business messaging, the Meta AI app, and AI devices, including spatial computing.\n\nThe social networking giant in April launched the Meta AI app, built with its Llama 4 training model, with chatbot and web-searching features. Previously, Llama had been embedded in Meta applications such as Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nAmid worries over AI competition, Google stock is down 19% in 2025. But Q1 earnings provided some upbeat news for Google stock on the AI front.\n\nMeanwhile, revenue growth at cloud computing giants has been a big theme. That's because capital spending on AI infrastructure has boomed at the cloud giants. Google's cloud unit reported revenue growth of 28% on April 24, in-line with estimates.\n\nBut Microsoft crushed Wall Street's fiscal third quarter targets amid strong sales of cloud computing and artificial intelligence services. Azure cloud revenue growth accelerated to 35% in constant currency, up from 31% in the prior quarter. Microsoft stock has advanced 4% in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft is the biggest investor in generative AI leader OpenAI, having spent some $14 billion on the startup. It cloud business benefits from handling OpenAI's ChatGPT services.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's cloud revenue growth decelerated to 17% from 19% in the prior quarter.\n\nNvidia Stock Cools Off\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia stock is now down 13% in 2025.\n\nA bellwether for AI stocks, chip maker Nvidia sold off after the Trump administration effectively barred the company from selling its custom artificial intelligence processors to customers in China.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia hosted its GTC Conference in mid-March. For Nvidia, margin pressure has been a key issue as it ramps up production of next-generation Blackwell AI chips in 2025. At GTC, Nvidia also updated its AI accelerator roadmap. However, whether customers will really need \"Rubin Ultra\" GPUs in 2027 and \"Feynman\" GPUs in 2028 remains a big question.\n\nExport rules are a wild card for AI chip makers.\n\nFor example, the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion categorizes countries into three tiers, affecting their ability to obtain AI semiconductors. While Trump administration discussions are still ongoing, one change \"involves scrapping the existing system to allow U.S.-designed chips to become a more strategic tool in international trade negotiations,\" said a UBS report.\n\nAI Stocks: Model Battle Heats Up\n\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI was valued at $300 billion as part of a new $40 billion fundraising round led by SoftBank. OpenAI builds large, multimodal foundation models. The OpenAI funding round was good news for infrastructure AI stocks because OpenAI has plenty capital for future data center build-outs.\n\nInvestors should keep a close watch on the fierce competition in AI models. One view is that competition between U.S. and open source AI models from DeepSeek and others would heat up amid a U.S.-China trade war.\n\nIn a post on April 4, OpenAI's chief executive Sam Altman noted plans to release GPT-5 in \"a few months.\" He added that it is much better than \"we originally thought.\"\n\nMeta on April 5 released its open source Llama 4 AI model family. Meta said the most powerful Llama 4 model, Llama 4 Behemoth, is still in training.\n\nGoogle recently released Gemini 2.5 while Anthropic continues to upgrade its Claude family of AI models. Then, there's Elon Musk' xAI startup with its Grok models.\n\nSafe Superintelligence Inc., co-founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, has raised $2 billion at a valuation of $32 billion, said a report. Greenoaks, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Andreessen Horowitz took part in the funding round.\n\nMeanwhile, China-based DeepSeek is readying the next version of its controversial open-source models. Generally, the AI models are battling in reasoning capabilities and other performance yardsticks as well as computing power needs.\n\nHere's IBD's take on the key questions involving DeepSeek, including U.S./China competition in artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Alibaba Holdings (BABA) has its Qwen AI models and Baidu (BIDU) has Ernie AI models.\n\nSoftware Makers Ramp AI Agents\n\nHaving struggled to generate new revenue from \"copilots,\" software companies are now turning to autonomous, goal-driven AI agents. One big issue for software companies is how fast customers ramp up pilot programs to commercial deployment.\n\nPalantir \u2014 as well as Snowflake and privately held Databricks \u2014 are focused on helping companies use proprietary data to build their own AI models. Here's a look at Databrick's strategy. Snowflake stock has gained 12% in 2025.\n\nIn an IBD interview, ServiceNow (NOW) Chief executive Bill McDermott explained about how the enterprise software maker aims to be an AI winner.\n\nMeanwhile, software maker Salesforce (CRM) reported Q4 earnings that disappointed. The software maker's fiscal 2026 outlook came in light even though it's ramping up new AI agents.\n\nThe commoditization of AI models could spur application development. While \"training\" AI models has been the biggest driver of capital spending, the market will shift to \"inferencing,\" or running AI applications, in the long run.\n\nApple Lags In AI Battle\n\nAmong AI stocks to watch, Apple (AAPL) has lagged in 2025. Apple stock has shed 20%.\n\nApple Intelligence features in iPhone 16 models have not sparked a big upgrade cycle. With iPhone 17 models expected to debut in September 2025, it remains to be seen whether Apple Intelligence features are improved. Voice assistant Siri has yet to be upgraded with advanced AI technology.\n\nMeanwhile, AI chip export restrictions remain a wild card on Nvidia stock as well as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nOn the earnings front, Broadcom (AVGO) reported fiscal Q1 results on March 6. Broadcom stock popped on its AI chip demand outlook. Broadcom makes custom AI chips for cloud computing titans.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM), ARM Holdings (ARM), and Marvell Technologies (MRVL) are other AI chip makers to watch.\n\nAlso, AI technology uses computer algorithms. The software programs aim to mimic the human ability to learn, interpret patterns and make predictions.\n\nUntil recently, machine learning was largely limited to models that processed data to make predictions. The AI models focused on pattern recognition from existing data. Corporate spending on AI projects was modest as companies mulled return on investment.\n\nAI Stocks To Watch By Industry Group\n\nCompany Symbol Comp Rating Industry name AI angle Nvidia (NVDA) 86 Elec-Semiconductor Fabless Cloud computing giants buying more chips to train AI models or run AI workloads. Big lead over rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). CrowdStrike (CRWD) 98 Computer Software-Security AI chatbots expected to automate more functions in security-operations centers and reduce the time to detect computer hacking. Arista Networks (ANET) 84 Computer-Networking Sells computer network switches that speed up communications among racks of computer servers packed into \"hyperscale\" data centers. With AI growth, internet data centers will need more network bandwidth. Microsoft (MSFT) 91 Computer Software-Desktop Biggest investor in generative AI startup Open AI, whose ChatGPT users require Azure cloud services. Microsoft's business AI assistant, Office 365 Copilot, is another potential revenue source. Salesforce (CRM) 73 Computer Software-Enterprise Pivoted to autonomous, goal-driven AI agents from conversational co-pilots. Expected to use a mix of subscription and consumption-based pricing. Amazon.com (AMZN) 85 Retail-Internet Alexa smart assistant upgraded. Cloud computing unit working with OpenAI rivals Anthropic, Hugging Face and Falcon 40B.\n\nNew generative AI models process \"prompts,\" such as internet search queries, that describe what a user wants to get. Generative AI technologies create text, images, video and computer programming code on their own.\n\nCompanies will aim to boost productivity by developing customized AI for specific industries. Proprietary company data will be used to train AI models.\n\nAI systems require massive computing power to find patterns and make inferences from large quantities of data. So the race is on to build AI chips for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, smartphones, drones and other devices.\n\nFor chipmakers, analysts expect a market for \"edge AI\" \u2014 on-device processing of AI apps to emerge.\n\nWill AI Startups Challenge Tech Giants\n\nWhat's more, one key question for investors is whether tech industry incumbents will be the big generative AI winners. Or, will a new wave of AI startups eventually dominate? OpenAI has told employees its now on an annual revenue run-rate of $3.4 billion, up from $2 billion in January.\n\nFurther, OpenAI recently laid out more details of its plans to adopt a for-profit business structure in 2025.\n\nLarge language models provide the building blocks to develop applications. Further, LLMs help AI systems understand the way that humans write and speak. Also, LLMs require training data for specific tasks. Companies with access to troves of data hold an edge.\n\nOpenAI is part of a wave of LLM startups that includes AI21 Labs, Anthropic and Cohere. Anthropic's latest funding round values it at $61.5 billion.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on X, formerly Twitter, @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWant To Trade Options?

        "title": "Inflation data, trade talks in focus: What to watch this week",
        "body": "Stocks ended last week slightly down after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's wait-and-see approach to interest rate policy and President Trump unveiled a trade deal between the US and UK.\n\nAll three major indexes finished last week in the red, as trade volatility moved stock charts. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank about 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gave up about 0.3%.\n\nThe week ahead will bring a fresh update on inflation, with the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday, as well as the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday. Retail sales will offer a read on the health of the American consumer. And investors will also be on the lookout for advancing trade deals, following a limited, bilateral pact with the UK.\n\nChina, the nation's third-largest trading partner, is also top of mind. US officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent huddled with Chinese officials this past weekend in Geneva, with the aim of de-escalating tensions and coming to some preliminary understanding. On Friday President Trump floated the idea of slashing China tariffs to 80%. Such an overture might invite Beijing to react with a tariff reduction of their own.\n\nInflation after 'Liberation Day'\n\nNew inflation data coming this week will offer investors the latest look at pricing pressures.\n\nThe readings carry significance because they will be among the first bits of \"hard\" economic data that captures, at least in part, the time period since Trump imposed heavy tariffs on the country's trading partners. Should the data show heightened pressures, it will bolster the case that the costs of a high-tariff regime are being born by American consumers, sapping their purchasing power. Producer prices can also offer a look at inflation before those costs hit consumers, revealing where prices are heading.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to increase 0.3% for the month of April compared to the prior month. In March, headline prices fell from the prior month for the first time since 2020. On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices are expected to climb 0.3% over the prior month and 2.8% compared to the same period last year.\n\nFed officials wait and watch\n\nThe Federal Reserve will be watching inflation data alongside the rest of us.\n\nLast week, policymakers at the central bank voted to keep rates where they are, citing the need for more data \u2014 and time \u2014 to understand the impacts of the tariffs, which are also still in flux.",

        "title": "This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Software Stock -- a 1,090% Gainer Since Its IPO -- Could Soar Another 285%, According to Dan Ives. Is It Time to Buy Like There's No Tomorrow?",
        "body": "The unreliable nature of these deals brings a level of uncertainty as it relates to future growth -- and Wall Street loathes businesses whose growth prospects look unreliable. In order to win over investor confidence, Palantir needed to show that its software platforms could win adoption from commercial customers, too. Thankfully, this is where AI comes into the spotlight.\n\nPalantir has relied heavily on deal flow from the DOD and adjacent government agencies for much of its 20-year history. While there are big bucks to be made in defense contracting, public sector business tends to be lumpy.\n\nLet's take a look at Palantir's operating results and valuation trends to assess the stock's ability to sustain its current momentum.\n\nYet, even with such a parabolic rise over the last couple of years, Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives suggests Palantir stock could still soar another 285% over the next two or three years, bringing the company into the coveted trillion-dollar club .\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020, Palantir's shares have gained about 1,090% as of this writing. Notably, the entirety of these gains occurred after April 2023 when Palantir released its latest software suite, the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).\n\nFor most of its history, skeptics on Wall Street viewed Palantir as no more than a glorified consulting business working closely with the Department of Defense (DOD). While much of Palantir's business still revolves around government contracts, rising interest in AI has fueled a new wave of potential for the company -- particularly in the private sector.\n\nOne company that has benefited greatly from AI is Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR). Sure, demand for AI-powered software services has been a bellwether for Palantir over the last couple of years. At a deeper level, though, AI has essentially transformed Palantir's entire operation.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is redefining how businesses across every major sector are operating. From enhanced analytics, automating mundane tasks in the workforce, and even building self-driving cars, it seems like AI is extending its influence across the entire economy.\n\nAnalyst Dan Ives thinks Palantir could reach a $1 trillion valuation in two or three years, but historical trends suggest otherwise.\n\nWhile the company still works closely with the Department of Defense (DOD), Palantir's main growth catalyst is now the private sector.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn the table below, I've outlined Palantir's customer breakdown and commercial account growth over the last several years.\n\nCategory 2021 2022 2023 2024 Q1\n\n2025* % Commercial Accounts 62% 71% 75% 80% 81% % Government Accounts 38% 29% 25% 20% 19% Commercial Account Growth (YOY) 200% 77% 44% 52% 46%\n\nData Source: Investor Relations. *Customer type breakdown for the trailing-12-month period.\n\nIn just four years, Palantir's customer base has shifted from less than two-thirds in the commercial sector to more than 80%. While it may look like the company's commercial business growth is slowing, don't let the figures above fool you.\n\nBack in 2021, Palantir only had 237 customers in total. As of the end of the first quarter of 2025, the company boasted 769 customers. Not only has Palantir accelerated its private sector penetration since the launch of AIP, but the company is also signing more meaningful deals, underscored by consistently rising revenue and widening profit margins.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n... history suggests tougher times may be ahead for the stock\n\nPalantir's dominance in the software realm over the last couple of years, coupled with a bullish overall sentiment around the AI opportunity, explains the stock's incredible rise. However, smart investors understand that a stock cannot climb forever.\n\nImmediately following the company's Q1 earnings report on May 5, Palantir stock plummeted. This wasn't because the earnings results were poor -- in fact, Palantir knocked it out of the park. Even so, the average consensus price target among analysts covering Palantir is about $94, suggesting about 21% downside as of May 8. Investors may simply be waking up to the fact that Palantir's valuation has expanded beyond levels that are congruent with the company's actual growth.\n\nWhen AIP launched in April 2023, Palantir's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio was about 8. Since then, its P/S valuation has expanded more than elevenfold in just two years. Palantir is one of the priciest stocks in the software space today, and history suggests that shares are due for a pullback.\n\nBack in the late 1990s, when internet stocks were experiencing their own moment of euphoria, companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Cisco topped out at P/S multiples between 30 and 40. This was prior to the dot-com bubble exploding, which saw many high-growth stocks crater in value.\n\nGiven that Palantir's current P/S is between two and three times more than the largest and most influential technology businesses during the peak of the dot-com era, investors should prepare for some valuation compression in the near term.\n\nCould Palantir reach a $1 trillion valuation?\n\nValuation multiples generally normalize over the long term. Another way of looking at this dynamic is that as companies begin to scale and generate more profits, investors begin to value these businesses based on earnings and less so on sales.\n\nToday, Amazon, Cisco, and Microsoft aren't generally analyzed through the lens of the P/S ratio. Rather, most investors look at these businesses on a price-to-earnings (P/E) or price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) basis. So, even though these companies are trading for much lower P/S ratios than they were many years ago, that doesn't mean shareholder value wasn't created over the last 20 years. Amazon and Microsoft, in particular, have evolved into two of the most valuable companies in the world as measured by market cap.\n\nEven though Palantir's valuation multiples will likely compress over the next couple of years, that doesn't necessarily mean the company won't ever become a trillion-dollar stock. That said, it probably won't happen in the next two or three years as Ives forecasts.\n\nInstead of focusing on the next two or three years, investors should think longer term. The most prudent strategy regarding an investment in Palantir is to buy the stock at different price points, take advantage of dips, and prepare to hold onto your shares for many years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "How much inventory did companies actually build ahead of tariffs?",
        "body": "\u201cCompanies typically maintain about 3 months of inventory,\u201d Chadha wrote. \u201cThey have been raising that buffer over the last 10 years, especially since the COVID pandemic supply chain disruptions, and the lowest levels in the last 10 years have been about 2 months, which suggests companies could run their buffers down for a month at most in hopes for a tariff reprieve.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn clear evidence of pre-buying, goods imports surged in Q1, especially in March, but relative to the prior run rate of $275bn a month, we estimate the excess imports over the last 3 months were about $190bn, or around 3 weeks extra,\u201c Chadha wrote in his May 2 research note.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Binky Chadha analyzed the data to estimate how much extra inventory companies have accumulated.\n\n\u201cAs a precaution, we've taken steps to build inventory in certain markets to mitigate potential tariff impact in the short term.\u201c - WD-40\n\n\u201cWe built some inventory where possible in certain items as we anticipate that to happen. So that gives a little relief of amounts needed to in some of the items. But the impact should be mostly concentrated in the second half.\u201d - Kraft Heinz\n\n\u201cWe've done some forward buys of inventory where we're the first-party seller. Our third-party sellers have pulled forward a number of items, so they have inventory here as well.\u201d - Amazon\n\n\u201cFor transparency, you will see that we did build ahead inventory, and that's reflected in our manufacturing purchase obligations that you'll see on the quarterly filing when it comes out.\u201c - Apple\n\n\u201cLooking outside the U.S., demand for U.S. inbound services surged as customers pull forward inventory purchases ahead of expected tariff changes.\u201d - UPS\n\n\u201cOur clients are getting ready. We're seeing some accelerating of imports to stockpile inventories.\u201d - Citigroup\n\nVarious anecdotes from companies and a spike in imports at the beginning of this year suggest this pull-forward could be significant . Here are some notable quotes from Q1 earnings season:\n\nOne of the actions some companies have taken to mitigate the impact of future tariffs has been to pulling forward expected future purchases and stockpiling goods before costs go up.\n\nA big economic question right now : To what degree does today\u2019s economic activity reflect a pull forward of purchases that would\u2019ve occurred further down the road?\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn other words, companies were already carrying extra inventory before President Trump unveiled his aggressive view on tariffs.\n\n\u201cExcess imports combined with inventory rundowns gives companies about 1 to 2 months before the tariff impacts start to bite,\u201d Chadha said.\n\nCompanies are preparing for tariff uncertainty by buying inventory two-to-three months out. \u00b7 Bloomberg\n\nSo while Chadha\u2019s estimate of \u201cabout 1 to 2 months\u201c of buffer for S&P 500 companies is arguably significant, it doesn\u2019t even buy a quarter\u2019s worth of time.\n\nSome analysts think it\u2019s less \u231b\ufe0f\n\nIn a separate analysis of retailer inventories, BofA analysts expressed skepticism toward the idea that warehouses are well stocked. From their note (emphasis added):\n\n\u201cThere was a surge in imports of consumer goods into the U.S. in March, according to Census Bureau data. Does this mean retailers' inventories are set to swell? In our view, no. The ratio of retailers' inventories to their monthly sales was not especially high in recent data to begin with. And at the same time, consumers also appear to have been buying ahead, with Bank of America internal data showing strength in consumer durables spending in March and April. Moreover, Bank of America internal data on retailers' payments to transportation and shipping companies does not suggest a big ramp up in inventories. And it appears container shipments into Los Angeles are likely down in May. So we think it is possible retail inventories may actually look 'lean' in coming months.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the most recent retail inventories data from the Census only goes through February. So those particular figures are a bit stale.\n\nRetain inventories loooked lean heading into tariff uncertainty. \u00b7 BofA\n\nThat said, BofA makes a good point about consumers \u201cbuying ahead.\u201d This suggests that a lot of goods left warehouses as quickly as they came in. This is consistent with government data on consumer spending, which has been very strong.\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 David Kostin analyzed the S&P 500 and came to a similar conclusion.\n\n\u201c1Q data do not show a buildup of inventories,\u201d Kostin wrote on Friday. \u201cThe S&P 500 inventory to sales ratio declined year/year, with the largest declines in the Autos and Consumer Durables & Apparel industries. However, many retailers have yet to report 1Q results.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 inventory-to-sales ratio declined, with the largest declines in autos, consumer durables, and apparel. \u00b7 Goldman Sachs\n\nThe March retail sales report showed an unusual spike in autos sales, which supports the idea that consumers pulled forward purchases to front-run tariffs.\n\nTo Kostin\u2019s point about fresh data, retailers will be announcing their Q1 results in the coming weeks. On Thursday morning we get Walmart\u2019s earnings. That day also comes with the April retail sales and March inventories reports. Everyone will be watching for clues about inventory builds as well as how much inventory was cleared out by sales pulled forward.\n\nZooming out \ud83d\udd2d\n\nEven if we had a more clear understanding of inventory levels, the bigger issue continues to be the uncertainty around tariffs.\n\nIf we ultimately get very high tariffs, then inventory stockpiling would\u2019ve been a good move. If any new tariffs are low, then inventory stockpiling could prove to be a costly error.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that proposed tariffs or any tariff deals continue to get delayed, and this uncertainty nightmare persists.\n\nThe big picture \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\n\nThese are uncertain times.\n\nThe economic data is sending ambiguous signals. Managers are having an unusually hard time forecasting the near future for the businesses. And investors and analysts are having an unusually hard time modeling where stock prices are headed in the coming months and quarters.\n\nIt\u2019s periods like this where long-term investors have an edge: Time.\n\n\u201cNobody knows what the market is going to do tomorrow, next week, next month,\u201d Warren Buffett said last week. But as he often does, he argued, \u201cThe long-term trend is up.\u201c\n\nThere\u2019s basically three scenarios investors always have to consider: 1) Things improve from here, and the market goes up; 2) Things get worse before they get better, which means markets could fall before resuming a more firm rally; or 3) Things get worse and never get better.\n\nIf we\u2019re facing scenario 3, then we may have bigger problems than stocks not recovering. But scenario 3 has never played out.\n\nScenarios 1 and 2 favor long-term investors. Maybe things get worse before they get better. (Note: Timing market bottoms is nearly impossible.) But staying long the stock market covers you in case the low of this cycle is behind us.\n\nReview of the macro crosscurrents \ud83d\udd00\n\nThere were several notable data points and macroeconomic developments since our last review:\n\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Fed holds rates, Powell warns on tariffs. In its monetary policy announcement on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve left its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\nFederal Reserve left its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. \u00b7 FRED\n\nFrom the Fed\u2019s policy statement: \u201cAlthough swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. \u2026 Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Wednesday, May 7, 2025, at the Federal Reserve in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nHere\u2019s what Fed Chair Powell said about tariffs during the post-meeting press conference: \u201cIf the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment.\u201c\n\nFor more on how tariff rhetoric is affecting the economy, read: CHART: The confusing state of the economy \ud83d\udcca and We're gonna get ambiguous signals in the economic data \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\n\n\ud83d\udcb3 Card spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: \u201cAs of 29 Apr 2025, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 2.2% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 29 Apr 2025, our estimate of the US Census April control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.46%.\u201d\n\nCredit card spending is incfeasing on a YOY basis. \u00b7 JPMorgan\n\nFrom BofA: \u201cCredit and debit card spending per household increased 1% year-over-year (YoY) in April after a gain of 1.1% YoY in March, according to Bank of America aggregated card data. Seasonally adjusted (SA) spending per household was flat month-over-month (MoM), with the seasonally adjusted annualized growth rate (SAAR) remaining at 1.6% again for April.\u201c\n\nConsumer spending is up 1.6% on an annualized basis for April. \u00b7 BofA\n\nApril spending is likely being boosted by consumers pulling forward purchases in an attempt to front-run tariffs.\n\nFor more on consumer spending, read: We're gonna get ambiguous signals in the economic data \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab and Americans have money, and they're spending it \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udcbc Unemployment claims tick lower.

From AAA: \u201cIn the lull between spring travel and the kick-off to summer, gas demand slid week over week, dropping the national average three cents to land at $3.15. OPEC+ (the group of oil-producing countries) announced Saturday that it will increase output again in June, widening the supply surplus, which could cause crude prices to continue to fall. This means road trippers would see lower prices at the pump this summer.

From the BLS: \u201cNonfarm business sector labor productivity decreased 0.8% in the first quarter of 2025 \u2026 as output decreased 0.3% and hours worked increased 0.6%. \u2026 This is the first decline in nonfarm business sector labor productivity since the second quarter of 2022.

According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged at 6.76%. From Freddie Mac: \u201cMortgage rates stayed flat this week. At this time last year, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 30 basis points higher and purchase applications were declining. Today, rates are lower and have remained stable for weeks, sparking continued increases in purchase applications.\u201d\n\nThere are 147.8 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.1 million are owner-occupied and about 34.1 million of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows.

From S&P Global\u2019s May U.S. Services PMI: \u201cWhile tariff announcements mean manufacturing dominates the news, a worrying backstory is developing in the vastly larger services economy, where business activity and hiring have come closer to stalling in April amid plunging business confidence. Business and consumer facing service providers alike, and especially financial services firms, are reporting markedly weaker growth prospects, citing intensifying uncertainty over the economic outlook amid recent tariff announcements and ongoing federal spending cuts.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile, the ISM\u2019s Services PMI improved slightly in April.\n\nKeep in mind that during times of perceived stress, soft survey data tends to be more exaggerated than actual hard data.\n\nFor more on soft sentiment data, read: The confusing state of the economy \ud83d\udcca and What businesses do > what businesses say \ud83d\ude4a\n\n\ud83d\udea2 Trade deficit balloons as imports surge. Here\u2019s Bloomberg on March Census data: \u201cThe US trade deficit widened to a record in March as companies rushed to import products including pharmaceuticals as the Trump administration readied sweeping tariffs. The goods and services trade gap grew 14% from the prior month to $140.5 billion, Commerce Department data showed Tuesday. \u2026 Imports of consumer goods climbed by the most on record, primarily due to the largest-ever inflow of pharmaceutical preparations. Imports of capital equipment and motor vehicles also increased.\n\nFrom Bloomberg\u2019s Michael McDonough: \u201cPharmaceutical imports led the surge, soaring to a record high in March as U.S. companies rushed to stock up before tariffs hit. Imports of medicines, vaccines, and blood-related products saw the biggest increases, highlighting companies' urgency to secure supplies.\u201c\n\nFor more on the implications of purchases pulled forward ahead of tariffs, read: A BIG economic question right now \ud83e\udd14 and CHART: The confusing state of the economy \ud83d\udcca\n\n\u26d3\ufe0f Supply chain pressures remain loose.

From Kastle Systems: \u201cPeak day office occupancy was 63.3% on Tuesday last week, down six tenths of a point from the previous week. New York and Washington, D.C. hit new single-day record highs, up 2.7 points to 69.3% and one full point to 63.4%, respectively. Several other cities experienced losses, led by Dallas, where occupancy on Tuesday fell 4.4 points to 67.1%. The average low was on Friday at 34.8%, up more than nine full points from the previous week\u2019s holiday.\u201d\n\nFor more on office occupancy, read: This stat about offices reminds us things are far from normal \ud83c\udfe2\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Near-term GDP growth estimates are tracking positive. The Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model sees real GDP growth rising at a 2.3% rate in Q2.\n\nPutting it all together \ud83e\udd14\n\n\ud83d\udea8 The tariffs announced by President Trump as they stand threaten to upend global trade \u2014 with significant implications for the U.S. economy, corporate earnings, and the stock market. Until we get some more clarity, here\u2019s where things stand:\n\nEarnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\n\nDemand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, while cooling, also remains positive, and the Federal Reserve \u2014 having resolved the inflation crisis \u2014 has shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\n\nBut growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \u201ccoiled\u201d these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.\n\nActions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period given that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor\u2019s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\n\nStocks are not the economy: Analysts expect the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy, thanks largely due to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have adjusted their cost structures aggressively. This has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth \u2014 in the cooling economy \u2014 is translating to robust earnings growth.\n\nMind the ever-present risks: Of course, this does not mean we should get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about \u2014 such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, cyber attacks, etc. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\n\nInvesting is never a smooth ride: There\u2019s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect to experience as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\n\nThink long term: For now, there\u2019s no reason to believe there\u2019ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won\u2019t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it\u2019s a streak long-term investors can expect to continue.\n\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co",

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 At the biggest jewelry center in the United States, Alberto Hernandez fired up his machine on a recent day and waited until it glowed bright orange inside before shoveling in an assortment of rings, earrings and necklaces weighing about as much as a bar of soap: just under 100 grams, or 3.2 troy ounces.\n\nMinutes later, the bubbling liquid metal was cooling in a rectangular cast the size of a woman's shoe. An X-ray machine determined it was 56.5% gold, making it worth $177,000 based on the price of gold that day.\n\nAs gold prices soar to record highs during global economic jitters, hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of gold are circulating through the doors of St. Vincent Jewelry Center in downtown Los Angeles on any given day.\n\nMany of the center\u2019s 500 independent tenants, which include jewelers, gold refiners and assayers, say they have never seen such a surge in customers.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re seeing a lot of rappers and stuff melting their big pieces,\u201d said Alberto\u2019s nephew, Sabashden Hernandez, who works at A&M Precious Metals. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of new customers who are just getting all of their grandfather\u2019s stuff, melting it down pretty much.\u201d\n\nGold\u2019s current rally comes as President Donald Trump issues ever-changing announcements on tariffs, roiling financial markets and threatening to reignite inflation.\n\nIn response, people across the country are flocking to sell or melt down their old jewelry for quick cash, including middlemen like pawn shop owners. Others, thinking their money might be safer in gold than in the volatile stock market, are snapping it up just as fast.\n\nLos Angeles jeweler Olivia Kazanjian said people are even bringing in family heirlooms.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re melting things with their family\u2019s wedding dates and things from the 1800s,\u201d Kazanjian said.\n\nShe recently paid a client for a 14-karat gold woven bracelet with intricate blue enamel work that could be turned into a brooch. The customer walked away with $3,200 for the amount of gold contained in the piece measured in troy ounces, the standard for precious metals equivalent to 31 grams.\n\nBut Kazanjian doesn't plan to melt the piece. The real artistic and historical value was a lot more, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just stunning \u2026 and you won\u2019t see that kind of craftsmanship again,\u201d Kazanjian said, adding she has persuaded some customers to change their minds about melting items. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of history, and if you\u2019re lucky enough to inherit it, it\u2019s a piece of your family.\"\n\nBusinesses on the sales side of the action, offering gold bars and other material, also are working hard to keep up with the frenzy.",

        "body": "\u201cIn the 1970s, when busing began in the schools, the teachers were tasked with categorizing the students in their classrooms,\u201d said Wendy Gaudin, 54, referring to the effort in some cities to desegregate public schools. Her Creole grandparents left New Orleans for California. As an adult, Ms. Gaudin returned and now teaches in New Orleans at Xavier University, the only Catholic school among the nation\u2019s historically Black colleges and universities. \u201cI was categorized as a Native American, and my sister Roslyn was categorized as Caucasian, and my sister Leslie was categorized as a Pacific Islander.\u201d\n\nProfessor Gaudin, who has written a book about identity in the Creole diaspora, described how this racial ambiguity could help Creoles when they confronted obstacles in a place that was not quite the promised land that they had hoped. When her grandparents found property in Los Angeles to build a home, they discovered that the neighborhood had a racial covenant excluding Black people. Her grandmother, who was \u201cvery, very fair skinned,\u201d she said, went to the bank, paid the deposit and signed the papers. Then her grandfather, who was darker-skinned, built a house and they moved in.\n\n\u201cAnd nothing could be said, because the land was already theirs,\u201d she said.\n\nThere were some who chose to live in their new hometowns as white people, or who simply lived that way because no one ever asked. This did not always involve explicitly creating a new identity; often, it involved simply moving away and keeping quiet.\n\nOne of those whose Louisiana Creole roots were unknown, at least to most around them, was George Herriman, who created the famed comic strip \u201cKrazy Kat,\u201d and who was assumed to be Greek by some of his associates. The Louisiana Creole heritage of Anatole Broyard, the influential New York writer and literary critic who wrote book reviews for The Times, was not publicly known until years after his death.\n\nIn 1946, Mr. Roudan\u00e9\u2019s grandmother filed to have the family surname officially changed \u2014 likely dropping the \u2018z\u2019 because it might tip the authorities off to his Creole heritage \u2014 and shortly after, her son was admitted to Tulane University, which at the time was all white. A few years after graduating, he moved to the Midwest and lived the rest of his life as a white man.",

Tourism has hit record levels, as Los Angeles prepares to step onto the world stage as the host of the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\nBut for all of that, there are rising signs that California is entering one of the most difficult periods in its history. The state is confronting what many leaders and officials say is an unprecedented confluence of forces \u2014 economic, political, social, environmental \u2014 that\u2019s about to test its long record of resilience in the face of catastrophe, natural and otherwise.\n\nThose population figures may prove to be a mirage. Analysts say the state\u2019s population could well decline because of the wildfires that wiped out more than 6,000 homes in Los Angeles in January and because of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. Many young people are moving to other states to escape a housing shortage, leaving behind an aging population in a state that has long been a symbol of youth and energy.\n\nLos Angeles, an economic engine for the state, is grappling with a $1 billion budget shortfall even before it confronts the challenge of rebuilding from the fires and the potential economic drain of preparing for the Olympics. Like San Francisco, it is struggling with an epidemic of homelessness on its sidewalks and downtown business districts that have been hollowed out by the Covid pandemic.",

        "body": "After what I have learned from the Whitmers and other parents around the country, I\u2019m not sure why my family has been so lucky. But I do know that Louisa spends most of her time in classes with her peers, because of the creative thinking and support of compassionate educators. I also know that learning with her peers has had an astounding impact on her social and intellectual development. Louisa reads fantasy novels in her spare time. She is excited by the periodic table and the lab experiments she completes in small groups in her science class. She has sleepovers with friends. None of this would have been possible if she had been forced to learn in a segregated classroom.\n\nThe significant disparities in Adaline\u2019s and Louisa\u2019s educations run counter to federal law. IDEA and several Supreme Court decisions have established a mandate for the education of students with disabilities \u2014 even those with the highest support needs. But states have been slow to end the practice of placing students in separate classrooms, even when parents like the Whitmers advocate more time in a mainstream academic setting. As recently as 2022, the latest year for which data is available, only 67 percent of students with disabilities were spending at least 80 percent of their school day in a general education classroom.\n\nStates have had 50 years to meet the standards of education promised in IDEA and its predecessor, yet those standards have never been universally met. In 2024, 24 states (including Oklahoma), six territories and Washington, D.C., were labeled \u201cneeding assistance\u201d for two or more consecutive years. States in that category are directed to use IDEA funds specifically for areas where they are not meeting requirements. Now that the Department of Education has lost nearly half of its staff members, too few are left to ensure that states meet their responsibilities to students with disabilities. If the Whitmers and other parents choose to file a due process claim with the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Education, there are probably not enough staff members left to investigate.\n\nIDEA has never been widely followed, and the Department of Education\u2019s bureaucracy wasn\u2019t perfect. But the lack of federal oversight will only worsen existing problems. It will make it even easier for states to interpret the law as they see fit. Those disparities could mean that many students with disabilities will lose the right to a free and appropriate education and their parents will lose the power to force change.\n\nSome parents who participated in the complaint against Bixby Public Schools told me that not enough has changed, and the costs to those parents, including for time off work and lawyers\u2019 fees, have been significant. As Ms. Whitmer put it, \u201cWe\u2019ve burned every bridge with everyone in the district.\u201d But she pledges to keep on fighting. The alternative would be to acquiesce to the district\u2019s dim vision of her daughter\u2019s capabilities and her future.",

On Thursday, a Chicago native and Villanova University graduate named Robert Prevost supplanted Trump. He became the first American pope, taking the name Leo XIV.\n\nAnd it happened at exactly the right time.\n\nI\u2019m not Catholic. I\u2019m an evangelical from the rural South who grew up so isolated from Catholicism that I didn\u2019t even know any Catholics until I went to law school. But I\u2019m deeply influenced by Catholicism, in both its ancient and its modern forms.\n\nI devoured the works of Augustine and Thomas Aquinas in college. And one of my favorite classes was about liberation theology, a left-wing, modern Catholic approach to the Gospel that puts an emphasis on improving the material conditions of the poor, in part through political and economic reform. And no book has influenced my approach to abortion and human life more than Pope John Paul II\u2019s encyclical \u201cEvangelium Vitae.\u201d\n\nIt was in this study and reflection that I understood the true importance of the historical stream of Christian thought. Christianity is an ancient faith, one that has endured through rulers and regimes far more ignorant and brutal than anything we\u2019ve ever confronted in the United States.",

Lee Jae-myung was a teenage sweatshop worker whose family survived on rotten fruits. Kim Moon-soo was imprisoned and tortured for anti-government \u200b\u200bactivism. Both survived weeks of political and legal turbulence that threatened to upend their presidential bid.\n\nNow, as the official campaign for the June 3 poll kicks off on Monday, Mr. Lee and Mr. Kim have emerged as two main contenders. They represent opposite sides of a political divide that is unlikely to be bridged, even though both have promised to pursue national unity if elected.\n\nThe election follows the removal last month of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached for his short-lived attempt to place South Korea under martial law. As such, the campaign is being fought less over policies and more as a referendum on Mr. Yoon and his right-wing People Power Party.\n\nThe party has not cut ties with Mr. Yoon, who is facing trial on insurrection charges. Instead, it has \u200bveered further to the right by choosing Mr. Kim, Mr. Yoon\u2019s former \u200blabor minister, as its presidential candidate. When Mr. Yoon\u2019s cabinet members were asked during a parliamentary session in December to apologize for the imposition of martial law, Mr. Kim was the only one who refused to stand and bow.",

Masculinity \u201cdoesn\u2019t factor into how I think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I definitely feel more masculine.\u201d\n\nAt first Mr. Batey had trouble finding a suitable opponent. Last year, he went to New York to spar with Billy McFarland, the creator of Fyre Festival, the fraudulent music event that inspired a Netflix documentary. But Mr. McFarland backed out after Karate Combat refused to guarantee him a $100,000 appearance fee, Mr. Batey said. Mr. McFarland declined to comment. (Payouts vary across Karate Combat\u2019s influencer fights. One contract reviewed by The New York Times offered a $2,000 participation fee and a bonus of $10,000 in Karate tokens if the fighter landed a knockout punch.) A second possible opponent declined to fight Mr. Batey over concerns about the venue: He couldn\u2019t appear at an Ethereum conference because he was loyal to Solana, a rival cryptocurrency.\n\nBy January, Mr. Batey was worried the fight wouldn\u2019t come together in time. Then a solution emerged: Chauncey St. John, a crypto entrepreneur based in upstate New York.\n\nMr. St. John does not seem much like a fighter. \u201cI\u2019ve got this Mr. Rogers vibe to me,\u201d he said recently. But he had endured his share of hardship in the crypto world. In 2021, he founded Angel Protocol, a start-up that aimed to help charities raise money using crypto. Unfortunately, he steered his clients toward an investment platform tied to Luna, a digital currency whose price crashed overnight in 2022, setting off a meltdown in the crypto markets that erased much of what the charities had raised.\n\nAfter the Luna crash, Mr. St. John, 38, retreated from public view. He reimbursed the charities with money his firm had saved up and embraced Christianity, searching for meaning in the worst moment of his career.

But the topic has surfaced repeatedly. When U.S. officials unveiled a trade deal with Britain on Thursday, for instance, beef was part of the agreement.\n\nBut according to Britain, the deal would simply make it cheaper for Americans to export more hormone-free beef to the country and would not weaken British health and safety rules, which are similar to those in the E.U.\n\nWhen it comes to the European Union, the United States can already export a large amount of hormone-free beef without facing tariffs, so an equivalent deal would do little to help American farmers.\n\nBut diplomats and European officials have repeatedly insisted that there is no wiggle room to lower those health and safety standards. And when it comes to meat-related trade restrictions more broadly, there is very little. Chicken, for instance, faces relatively high tariffs, and there is limited appetite to lower those rates.",

Most of the contracts were canceled in February and March, when Mr. Musk\u2019s group, the Department of Government Efficiency, was demanding that agencies make huge cuts in spending and staff.\n\nThen agencies reinstated them, sometimes just days later. In one case, the Environmental Protection Agency revived a contract after just 2 \u00bd hours.

        "title": "This American pope: Leo XIV\u2019s bloodline reflects the US melting pot",
        "body": "Pope Leo XIV, who on Thursday was elected as the first-ever US-born leader of the Roman Catholic church, has a familial bloodline that reflects his homeland\u2019s fraught relationship with race \u2013 and why the nation\u2019s stature as a melting pot of origins has long endured, records unearthed by genealogists show.\n\nThe maternal grandfather of 69-year-old Robert Prevost, the newly minted pope, was evidently born abroad in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, according to birth records that professional genealogist Chris Smothers cited to ABC News in a recent report. When Leo\u2019s grandfather, Joseph Martinez, obtained an 1887 marriage license to wed the future pope\u2019s grandmother, Louise Baqui\u00e9, he listed his birthplace as Haiti, which at the time was the same territory as Santo Domingo, Smothers noted.\n\nBaqui\u00e9\u2019s birth records, meanwhile, indicate that she was born in Louisiana\u2019s most prominent city, New Orleans, to parents who were reportedly married at a local Catholic church.\n\nRecords from the 1900 census show that Joseph \u2013 apparently the son of a Louisianan \u2013 and Louise lived at a home in New Orleans\u2019s Seventh Ward, a bastion for the city\u2019s Creole people. The couple\u2019s home later was among hundreds that were demolished to make way for a highway overpass linking New Orleans\u2019s suburbs to its globally renowned French Quarter, a move that drastically reduced the area\u2019s population and economically devastated the scores of Black businesses that had been prevalent there.\n\nThose same census records identified Leo\u2019s maternal grandparents as Black. Two of his aunts were similarly identified, just about four years after the Plessy v Ferguson US supreme court case \u2013 which originated in New Orleans \u2013 upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation in the country.\n\nBy 1920, the Martinez family had moved north to Chicago and away from the racially oppressive US south. The future pope\u2019s mother, the Chicago-born Mildred Agnes Martinez, was eight at the time. And the census that decade listed the Martinezes as white.\n\nIt would not be until 1954 that the US supreme court would issue the ruling that overturned the Plessy v Ferguson precedent and deemed racial segregation unconstitutional \u2013 and even then, many communities across the nation spent years flouting the decision. Multiple genealogists theorized that the Martinezes may have strategically shifted their racial identity to assimilate in Chicago, which \u2013 though further north \u2013 has had its own history of discrimination and oppression on the basis of skin color.\n\n\u201cYou can understand [that] people may have intentionally sought to obfuscate their heritage,\u201d Jari Honora, a family historian for the Historic New Orleans Collection, told the Associated Press. Honora added that \u201calways life has been precarious for people of color\u201d.\n\nMildred Martinez eventually married Louis Marius Prevost. The librarian and her husband \u2013 a second world war veteran and educator \u2013 raised three sons in Chicago. The youngest, Robert, was ordained a priest in 1982; became the worldwide leader of the Catholic religious order colloquially known as the Augustinians; led a Peruvian diocese; was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in September 2023; and headed the Vatican entity in charge of selecting new bishops around the world.\n\nThe US registered a record-setting 47.8 million immigrants in 2023, three-quarters of whom were naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents or visa holders \u2013 all of whom buttressed the country\u2019s centuries-old, metaphorical reputation as a melting pot.\n\nThat status has come under threat when Donald Trump clinched a second US presidency the following year \u2013 and his administration mounted an immigration crackdown marked by steady news of detentions and deportations after he returned to the Oval Office in January.\n\nLeo\u2019s fellow cardinals elected him to succeed the late Francis after a two-day conclave that concluded less than four months into Trump\u2019s second presidency. And one of Leo\u2019s older brothers, suburban Chicago resident and retired Catholic school principal John Prevost, quickly told the New York Times: \u201cI know he\u2019s not happy with what\u2019s going on with immigration.\u201d\n\nSocial media users just as rapidly flocked to an account seemingly belonging to Leo and noted how it had demonstrated a willingness to be critical of the administration\u2019s positions. One of the account\u2019s entries reposted an article about Catholic bishops in California who attributed \u201cracism and nativism\u201d to Trump\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cbad hombres\u201d for certain Mexicans.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how much Leo might be a foil to the chief executive of the global superpower from which he hails, among other issues confronting the pope. And there is no indication Leo has ever publicly discussed his racial identity much.\n\nJohn Prevost, for his part, told the Times that his brothers did not discuss their Louisiana roots. He also said his immediate family did not identify as Black.\n\nA Vatican news release said Leo\u2019s father was of French and Italian descent. It said the pope\u2019s mother was of Spanish ancestry.\n\nWhatever the case, Loyola Marymount University professor Kim R Harris, who teaches African American religious thought and practice, remarked to the AP that she hopes Leo\u2019s papacy \u201cbrings to light who we are as Americans and who we are as a people of the diaspora\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about a person who brings so much of the history of this country in his bones,\u201d Harris said, \u201cit brings a whole new perspective and widens the vision of who we all are.\u201d",

        "body": "Donald Trump has hailed a \u201ctotal reset\u201d in US-China trade relations after the first day of talks between top American and Chinese officials in Geneva aimed at defusing a trade war sparked by his tariff rollout.\n\nThe US president praised the \u201cvery good\u201d discussions and deemed them \u201ca total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business,\u201d he posted on his Truth Social platform early on Sunday, adding: \u201cGREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!\u201d He did not elaborate on the progress.\n\nEarlier, top US and Chinese officials wrapped up the first day of talks in the Swiss city aimed at de-escalating tensions that threaten to hammer the global economy. Negotiations were expected to continue on Sunday, a source close to the discussions said.\n\nChina\u2019s vice-premier, He Lifeng, met for about eight hours with US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, in their first face-to-face meeting since the world\u2019s two largest economies heaped tariffs well above 100% on each other\u2019s goods.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs imposed on China this year currently total 145%, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching 245%. China has slapped retaliatory levies of 125% on US goods, cementing what appears to be a near trade embargo between the two countries\n\nNeither side made any statements afterwards about the substance of the discussions nor signalled any specific progress towards reducing the crushing tariffs as meetings at the residence of Switzerland\u2019s ambassador to the UN concluded about 8pm local time (1800 GMT).\n\nBessent, Greer and He were meeting in Geneva after weeks of growing tensions prompted by Trump\u2019s tariff blitz starting in February and retaliation from Beijing that has brought nearly $600bn in annual bilateral trade to a virtual standstill. The trade dispute, combined with Trump\u2019s decision last month to impose duties on dozens of other countries, has disrupted supply chains, unsettled financial markets and stoked fears of a sharp global downturn.\n\nThe location of the talks in the Swiss diplomatic hub was never made public. However, witnesses saw both delegations returning after a lunch break to the gated UN ambassador\u2019s villa in Cologny.\n\nEarlier, US officials including Bessent and Greer smiled as they left their hotel on the way to the talks. Bessent declined to speak to reporters. At the same time, Mercedes vans with tinted windows were seen leaving a hotel where the Chinese delegation was staying.\n\nView image in fullscreen Members of the Chinese delegation after leaving the trade talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on Saturday. Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters\n\nWashington is seeking to reduce its $295bn goods trade deficit with Beijing and persuade China to renounce what the US says is a mercantilist economic model and contribute more to global consumption. Beijing has pushed back against what it sees as external interference and wants Washington to lower tariffs and clarify what it wants China to buy more of.\n\nChina\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Saturday that the US\u2019s \u201creckless abuse of tariffs\u201d had destabilised the global economic order, but added that the negotiations represented \u201ca positive and necessary step to resolve disagreements and avert further escalation\u201d.\n\nEconomic analysts have low expectations of a breakthrough. Trump said on Friday that an 80% tariff on Chinese goods \u201cseems right\u201d, suggesting for the first time a specific alternative to the 145% levies he has imposed on Chinese imports.\n\nHe has suggested the discussions were initiated by China. Beijing said the US requested the discussions and that China\u2019s policy of opposing US tariffs had not changed.\n\nThe US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told Fox News on Friday: \u201cThe president would like to work it out with China. He would like to de-escalate the situation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, clarified that the US would not lower tariffs unilaterally and that China would need to make concessions.\n\nThe Swiss economy minister, Guy Parmelin, met both parties in Geneva on Friday and said the fact the talks were taking place was already a success.\n\n\u201cIf a road map can emerge and they decide to continue discussions, that will lower the tensions,\u201d he told reporters on Friday, saying talks could continue into Sunday or even Monday.",

        "body": "Footage of long queues at the doors of properties for lease has become a regular feature of property reporting over the past few years.\n\nLandlords have upped their asking rents by double digits. Ahead of last weekend\u2019s election, the Greens campaigned hard for rent freezes to stop the \u201cunlimited rent increases\u201d they claimed the major parties tacitly supported.\n\nThere have been horror stories of single parents struggling to find an affordable home, while a lack of housing plagues residents in disaster-stricken towns such as Lismore.\n\nYet the rental crisis is not what you think it is.\n\nThat\u2019s because for the vast majority of renting households, it\u2019s not a crisis at all.\n\nBen Phillips, an associate professor at the Australian National University Centre for Social Research and Methods, says talk of a national rental crisis is \u201coverblown\u201d.\n\nPhillips says much of the media attention has been focused on the rapid rise in advertised rents, which peaked at well over 15% in 2024, according to property research firm CoreLogic.\n\nThat\u2019s the fastest annual rate on record, according to this data stretching back about two decades.\n\nAnd since the end of 2019, this measure of rents has climbed by nearly 50%.\n\nBut Phillips, a member of the Albanese government\u2019s economic inclusion advisory committee, which has advocated for a major lift in the jobseeker payment, says these online advertised rents are only a small and unrepresentative share of the total rental market.\n\nThey reflect how difficult and pricey it is to move rentals, or rent for the first time. What they don\u2019t reflect is how much most of the roughly 3 million households with a lease are actually paying.\n\nAnd there, the picture is very different.\n\nThe most comprehensive database on rents paid is produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as part of its consumer price index (or CPI, which measures inflation) series.\n\nThe ABS each month tracks rental rates for about 600,000 properties, or nearly one in three leased homes.\n\nAnd by this measure, rents have climbed by 19% in just over five years - or less than half the CoreLogic reported rate.\n\nThat\u2019s not nothing, but it is two percentage points less than the overall increase in the CPI over that same period. In other words, rents have been a drag on overall inflation.\n\nMichael Fotheringham, the managing director of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, says Phillips\u2019 analysis is right.\n\nThe Corelogic rental data \u201cshow a more inflamed market than ABS data, and that\u2019s because a significant proportion of renters are in a stable situation\u201d, Fotheringham says.\n\n\u201cThey have been in that property for more than a year, and have a landlord who is not looking to jack up rents whenever they can,\u201d he says.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also renters who are struggling to find a property at a time when the national vacancy rate is at a record low of 1% \u2013 as it has been for the past two years \u2013 against a more typical rate of 2.5%.\n\n\u201cThey are both correct [the two sets of data] but they are talking about different things.\u201d\n\nThat said, Fotheringham says, there is a \u201cfundamental problem with the word \u2018crisis\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe problems in the housing market have not appeared suddenly, like a natural disaster, he says, and an emergency response is not the way to fix the problems that ail the housing market.\n\n\u201cWe have a badly broken housing system that we have been sleepwalking into for 40 years. We need long, slow, multifaceted programs. It\u2019s taken decades to get us into this mess, and it won\u2019t be fixed by Christmas.\u201d\n\nPhillips, in the unreleased research paper Australian Rental Cost Trends, says the confusion over how much rental prices have increased boils down to the difference between the \u201cstock\u201d of properties versus the \u201cflow\u201d of properties.\n\n\u201cEconomists often make this distinction using a bath tub analogy,\u201d he writes.\n\n\u201cA small flow of hot water (new rent data) makes little difference to a much colder and larger stock of water in the bath (all rents in the market).\u201d\n\nAverages can hide a multitude of sins, but Phillips says the Albanese government\u2019s boosts to rental assistance and parenting payments have helped cushion the impact of higher rents on lower income households.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are struggling, but the talk of a generalised rental crisis is overblown,\u201d he says.\n\nPhillips\u2019 analysis shows that rental affordability has actually improved over the past decade, with renters\u2019 incomes rising faster than rents.\n\nDespite a recent uptick, he estimates that rental costs as a share of renters\u2019 incomes have dropped \u201cfairly substantially\u201d from 28% in 2013 to 26% now.\n\nSimilarly, a little over one in five renting adults in 2023 reported at least three forms of financial stress \u2013 a threshold for severe pressure, according to the latest Hilda survey.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s not much changed from the recent low of one in six in 2021, and it\u2019s about the same as the 15-year average.",

Whether the left or right can win a four out of six seats in each state \u2013 creating a \u201c4-2 split\u201d \u2013 is a deciding factor in the Senate, Rau explains in his recent update. He says generally almost all elections are a 3-3 split. But \u201cright now there is a possibility of a left-right split in five states, with the left leading in four of those states\u201d. The left could possibly win four seats out of every state, except Queensland where a 4-2 right split has become a 3-3 split, and a 2-0 split in the ACT, Rau explains.

Constables Jacob Pennisi and Philippe Stigner were called over to a car in the Deception Bay police station car park after their morning call outs around 6:20am on 1 March, where Julie Pedler was in the late stages of labour. Julie and husband Nathaniel Pedler pulled into the station \u201cknowing they did not have enough time to make it to the hospital,\u201d a QLD police statement said. Stigner helped birth the baby, relaying instructions from a triple zero operator. The birth took five minutes. When Pennsini heard the baby\u2019s first cries, he felt relief. He said: The call operator asked us to get a towel to wrap up the baby and to keep both mum and baby warm.\n\n\n\nWe found a towel in the back of the car, wrapped the baby up and the paramedics came about five minutes later. It all happened very fast. We definitely didn\u2019t expect to be involved with a birth that day, but that\u2019s the thing about this job, every day is different, every call out is unique. The Pedlers returned to the station, with Julie saying she wanted to \u201cthank police for the calm support,\u201d the QLD police statement said.

Liberal Mary Aldred is ahead of Labor in Monash, Victoria. And in Ryan, Queensland, we have a three-cornered contest with Greens\u2019 Elizabeth Watson-Brown ahead of Labor for second place on the primary vote.

The 15-year-old approached the gate at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne on Saturday afternoon, attempting to enter the match between Essendon and the Sydney Swans. The teen, who arrived without a ticket and was unable to get into the game, was searched by nearby officers, who found he was carrying a small knife and a fake gun. Police issued the youth with a caution. The AFL has been contacted for comment. It is the second time the AFL has been rocked by a weapons incident after two men were allegedly caught with guns at a Carlton-Collingwood clash with more than 82,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in April. The weapons were discovered after the pair, who were on bail, refused a security request to leave the venue due to their behaviour. Officials blamed the incident on a \u201cbreakdown\u201d in screening measures. \u2013 Australian Associated Press Share Updated at 05.21 CEST\n\n18h ago 05.04 CEST Men wielding machetes allegedly forced their way into Sydney home Three men wielding machetes allegedly forced entry into a home in Sydney\u2019s east in what police believe was a targeted incident. New South Wales police were called to a property in Bondi about 1.20am this morning after reports of a home invasion. Officers were told three men armed with machetes forced entry through the front door and threatened the occupants, the police statement said. A 38-year-old woman, a 26-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man were in the home. There were no reports of any person being seriously injured. Police believe the incident was targeted. A crime scene was established, an investigation has commenced and police are urging anyone with information to contact Waverly police station or Crime Stoppers. Share Updated at 05.07 CEST\n\n18h ago 04.46 CEST Unemployment rate expected to rise slightly Continued from previous post: The rates market has fully priced in a 25-basis point cut for May, with traders rating a bumper 50-basis point cut at more than even odds. At the previous board meeting on 1 April, RBA governor Michele Bullock noted the labour market was still tight, which could make it harder to get inflation back down. \u201cThere are some risks on the upside and the labour market is one of them,\u201d she said at the time. Not everyone agrees, but we still think there\u2019s tightness in the labour market. Bullock flagged the board would keep an eye on labour market data to help guide its rates decision. In ABS data released later in April, unemployment edged slightly higher to 4.1% in March. ANZ Bank economists expect the jobless rate to climb to 4.2% on Thursday, in line with the Reserve Bank\u2019s forecast of 4.2% from its February statement on monetary policy. But the outlook for unemployment has since worsened. The International Monetary Fund now predicts Australia\u2019s unemployment rate to climb to 4.5% by 2026, because economic growth is expected to be slower than previously assumed. \u2013 via Australian Associated Press View image in fullscreen People on their morning commute to work in Melbourne.

Domestic signals have taken somewhat of a back seat since US president Donald Trump\u2019s tariff dump in early April. But the wage price index and labour force figures, due to be published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be closely monitored. They are the last remaining major data releases that will influence the Reserve Bank board\u2019s decision when it meets to set interest rates on 19-20 May. Expectations of a rate cut have soared since Trump\u2019s tariffs roiled markets. With global trade set to be impacted, the economic growth outlook for Australia and the rest of the world has tumbled, while cheap goods diverted to the local market could drive domestic inflation down further. More to come in the next post. \u2013 via Australia Associated Press Share Updated at 04.50 CEST\n\n19h ago 04.05 CEST More than a tonne of cocaine allegedly found on motorboat off NSW coast More than a tonne of cocaine has been seized off the east coast of Australia and five men arrested after police raided a suspicious motorboat. Detectives said they were tipped off about the purchase of a 13-metre-long boat with a large sum of cash in Sydney\u2019s Sutherland shire on 28 April. Police said they began investigating and intercepted the vessel on Friday as it was travelling towards South West Rocks on the New South Wales mid-north coast. Officers allegedly found 1,110 blocks of cocaine together weighing more than a tonne on board. Police estimated this amount of cocaine was worth $623m on the street. Two men, aged 24 and 26, were arrested on board while another three men, aged 28, 29 and 35, were taken into custody on shore after officers stopped two cars allegedly trying to leave the area.

A signature pledge of the returning Albanese administration was 30% off the upfront price of batteries, targeting cheaper power bills and the transition to clean energy. Industry figures expect the battery subsidy program will be a priority given the fast-approaching start date of July 1. Solar and battery installer 1KOMMA5\u00b0 is confident the scheme will go ahead as promised and is applying the discount already in the expectation incentive costs can be claimed back once the program goes live. \u201cWe foresee, effectively, a mad rush for installation from July 1 and this gives a chance for consumers to get the benefit and beat the rush,\u201d the Sydney-based company\u2019s brand director Andre Scott told AAP. The catch is batteries purchased through the scheme can only be switched on after the upcoming start date. Scott said there was still a good argument to go early, with customers potentially facing installation backlogs once the floodgates officially opened. \u2013 via Australian Associated Press View image in fullscreen Solar panels on homes in Lawnton in Brisbane.

        "body": "Ed Husic has blamed Richard Marles for his shock ousting from the cabinet this week, accusing the deputy prime minister of being a \u201cfactional assassin\u201d.\n\nHusic on Sunday said he believed his speaking out on issues like Gaza was a \u201cfactor\u201d in his departure, and said the prime minister should have intervened.\n\n\u201cThe difficult issue here is that we\u2019ve had barefaced ambition and a deputy prime minister [who] wields a factional club to reshape the ministry,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s Insiders.\n\n\u201cI think people when they look at a deputy prime minister, they expect to see a statesman, not a factional assassin.\u201d\n\nHusic, in his first public comments since the new ministerial group was decided, said he had volunteered to leave the frontbench.\n\nUnder factional agreements within the Labor party, the New South Wales right faction, which Husic sits in, needed to make way for a member of the left faction.\n\nThe other three senior men from the NSW right are Tony Burke, Jason Clare and Chris Bowen.\n\nHusic said he didn\u2019t want the choice to be made through a national ballot.\n\n\u201cI made the decision. Ultimately we would have had to have taken it to a national right ballot. The way it was managed was all very last minute,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI did not want to put my colleagues through a national ballot. Again, I did it in the interests of stability.\u201d\n\nHusic said Anthony Albanese called him on Saturday, two days after the decision was formally announced on Thursday.\n\nAsked repeatedly by host David Speers whether the prime minister had thanked Husic for his service, Husic only said there was a \u201cvery brief\u201d discussion.\n\nHe said Albanese should have intervened to save him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here with false modesty. Of course, when you hear him [Albanese] rattle off names of \u2026 people that would be retaining ministerial spots, I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t the only minister wanting to be in that list,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf he [Albanese] had exercised that authority, I don\u2019t think anyone would have quibbled.\u201d\n\nMark Dreyfus, who was also dumped from the Albanese cabinet in favour of the younger Victorian right faction MP Sam Rae, reportedly made phone calls to Marles and factional allies to try to secure his position.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister also didn\u2019t intervene to save his position.\n\nHusic was the first Muslim to sit in the cabinet, and the first to be sworn in with a Qur\u2019an.\n\nHe has been outspoken on the war in Gaza and was the first government member to accuse Israel of \u201ccollective punishment\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t celebrate diversity and then expect it to sit in the corner silent.

        "body": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy has challenged Vladimir Putin to meet in person for peace talks in Istanbul on Thursday, in a dramatic gambit after a weekend of diplomatic flurry.\n\nHis comments came after Putin rejected a demand from Ukraine and European allies to sign up to a 30-day ceasefire, but said Russia was ready for direct negotiations with Ukraine. Putin said delegations from the two countries should meet on Thursday in Turkey.\n\nAlthough European leaders insisted there should be no negotiations until Putin agrees to a ceasefire, Donald Trump put pressure on Zelenskyy to agree \u201cimmediately\u201d to negotiations this week in a post on Truth Social. Shortly afterwards Zelenskyy went public with his surprise offer.\n\n\u201cWe await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,\u201d the Ukrainian president said in a statement. \u201cThere is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in T\u00fcrkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.\u201d\n\nThe two leaders have not communicated directly since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and there have been no publicly known talks between Moscow and Kyiv since March 2022, shortly after the war began.\n\nTrump said in a statement on his Truth Social platform that Ukraine should \u201cHAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Putin of Russia doesn\u2019t want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY. At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the U.S., will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!\u201d\n\nThe demand for a 30-day ceasefire was set out on Saturday during a visit to Kyiv by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, who together with Zelenskyy made a phone call to Trump before holding a joint press conference.\n\nBritain\u2019s Keir Starmer said that if Putin rejected the offer, \u201cwe will respond, working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions and increase our military aid for Ukraine\u2019s defence to pressure Russia back to the table\u201d.\n\n0:53 European leaders call for unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine \u2013 video\n\nPutin\u2019s response to the ultimatum came in the unusual form of a statement read out to journalists in a ceremonial Kremlin room at close to 2am local time. He accused Ukraine of breaking previous ceasefires, but said that \u201cdespite this\u201d he was suggesting the two parties meet for talks, which he said could take place in Istanbul this Thursday.\n\nHe did not say who would attend, though observers widely expected him to send his top diplomatic aides. \u201cWe are ready for serious talks with Ukraine, and we want to solve the root causes of the conflict,\u201d he said.\n\nPutin\u2019s tone appeared carefully calibrated to reject Europe\u2019s demands but also make Moscow appear to be playing constructively in the eyes of the Trump administration, which has tended to be much softer on Moscow than on Kyiv until recent days. Putin made a point of thanking the new US administration for its efforts to resolve the conflict.\n\nTrump\u2019s response suggests the tactic may have succeeded, delivering a significant blow to western unity. However, his Truth Social post also hinted at the frustration he has reportedly expressed in private in recent days over Moscow\u2019s hardline demands in the war in Ukraine.\n\nBy proposing a direct meeting with Putin in Istanbul, Zelenskyy appears to be seizing the initiative, putting pressure back on the Russian leader \u2013 who rarely travels spontaneously \u2013 to either attend or back down.\n\nPrior to Trump\u2019s intervention, Zelenskyy and his chief of staff Andriy Yermak had both ruled out talks before a ceasefire. \u201cFirst a 30-day ceasefire, then everything else,\u201d said Yermak.\n\n1:04 Putin says Russia wants 'serious negotiations with Ukraine' \u2013 video\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, had also written on X on Sunday morning that no talks would be possible until Putin agreed to the ceasefire. \u201cThere can be no negotiations while weapons are speaking. There can be no dialogue if, at the same time, civilians are being bombed,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe flurry of back-and-forth offers and ultimatums suggests fast-moving diplomacy around the conflict, but behind the rhetoric it is not clear how much of the fundamental positions of the two sides have changed.\n\nUkraine and its European allies want a full ceasefire, after which negotiations would start on a comprehensive settlement including a European \u201creassurance force\u201d inside Ukraine, the exact composition and duties of which are still under discussion among allies.\n\nPutin, on the other hand, wants to keep fighting to increase the pressure on Ukraine to sign up to a number of Moscow\u2019s core demands, which have changed little since the start of the war. As well as territorial claims to the regions it occupies, Moscow is expected to demand guarantees over Ukraine\u2019s future political and military decisions. The Kremlin has already made it clear it would not accept western troops stationed in Ukraine.\n\nA top Putin aide, Yuri Ushakov, said on Sunday that the previous first round of Istanbul talks, in spring 2022, should serve as the basis for any new negotiations. Leaked drafts of those discussions suggest that the Russian terms presented amounted to an effective surrender for Ukraine.\n\nTrump\u2019s support for Putin\u2019s idea came after his Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, backed the European position, in a sign that the US president is often unpredictable even for his own team. \u201cAs President Trump has repeatedly said, stop the killing!! An unconditional 30 day ceasefire first and, during it, move into comprehensive peace discussions. Not the other way around,\u201d Kellogg wrote on X.\n\nIn the hours after Putin\u2019s address on Sunday morning, Russia launched more than 100 drones at Ukraine, as a three-day ceasefire unilaterally declared by Putin came to an end.\n\nThe ceasefire was pegged to the 80th anniversary of victory in the second world war, for which Putin presided over a military parade in Moscow on Friday with guests who included the leaders of China and Brazil. Kyiv rejected that ceasefire, saying it was a cynical attempt to avoid attacks on Russia during the set-piece parade, while Moscow continues to reject calls for a longer-term ceasefire.",

Share Updated at 16.40 CEST\n\n6h ago 16.25 CEST Putin is 'wielding terror as leverage' and 'stalling for time' to avoid real 'path to peace' - Lithuanian foreign minister Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister, K\u0119stutis Budrys, has condemned Russia\u2019s continuing attacks on Ukraine despite Vladimir Putin\u2019s offer for talks on Thursday (for context: overnight, the Ukrainian air force said Russia attacked Ukraine with 108 drones). \u201cPutin\u2019s answer to yet another ceasefire proposal: a swarm of 100 drones raining down on Ukraine overnight,\u201d Budrys wrote in a post on X. \u201cPutin is playing his usual game \u2013 wielding terror as leverage and stalling for time to avoid any real path to peace.\u201d He added: Talking peace while Russian bombs keep falling on Ukrainian civilians is a farce. The rules are clear - unconditional ceasefire from Monday or face new tougher sanctions. The fact that Putin rushed to hold a press conference less than 24 hours after European leaders, backed by the US, demanded an unconditional ceasefire tells us everything. This approach works - and we must stick to it. Now we must follow through. If Russian guns do not go silent by Monday, a new round of sanctions must be enforced - without hesitation. Share\n\n6h ago 16.09 CEST When Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, he demanded that Ukraine renounce joining Nato, sharply cut its army, and \u201cprotect\u201d Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow\u2019s orbit. He since has also demanded that Kyiv withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022 but never fully occupied \u2014 Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. There are unconfirmed reports that the White House is considering recognising Russian control of Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, as part of a broad US proposal to end the war in Ukraine. Kyiv has said formally surrendering Crimea is a red line that goes against Ukraine\u2019s constitution and would be a concession unconscionable to Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russian officials also have said that any so-called peace deal should involve releasing Russian assets that were frozen in the west and lifting other US and EU sanctions.

It has maintained cordial ties with both sides and has voiced support for Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and provided it with military help, while opposing western sanctions on Russia. Erdo\u011fan on Sunday told his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron that a \u201chistoric turning point\u201d had been reached in efforts to end the war, according to the Turkish president\u2019s office. In a phone call, Erdo\u011fan was quoted as having told Macron: A historic turning point has been reached in efforts to end the war between Ukraine and Russia, that this opportunity must be seized, and that Turkey is ready to provide all kinds of support, including hosting negotiations, to achieve a ceasefire and lasting peace. As a reminder, Russian president Vladimir Putin said the proposed talks with Ukraine \u2013 to \u201csolve the root causes of the conflict\u201d - should be held in the Turkish city of Istanbul on 15 May, as they have been before.

        "body": "Pope Leo XIV has called for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and pleaded for an end to global conflicts, which he likened to a \u201cthird world war in pieces\u201d.\n\nIn his first Sunday address at the Vatican, the new pontiff urged an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian aid in Gaza and the release of all hostages. He also welcomed the truce between India and Pakistan and referenced the end of the second world war in 1945.\n\nAppearing on the central balcony of St Peter\u2019s Basilica, Leo blessed tens of thousands of people gathered in St Peter\u2019s Square and echoed pleas for peace by his predecessor, Pope Francis. \u201cI, too, address the world\u2019s great powers by repeating the ever-present call, \u2018never again war\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was the pope\u2019s first public appearance since he stepped out on a balcony last Thursday after a two-day conclave that elected him as the 267th pope. Previously a little-known cardinal, Robert Prevost, 69, is the first US leader of the Catholic church.\n\nView image in fullscreen Pope Leo XIV on the central balcony of St Peter\u2019s Basilica, wearing a simple white cassock, and singing instead of reciting the Regina Caeli prayer. Photograph: Ciancaphoto Studio/Getty Images\n\nVatican observers seeking clues to the direction and style of his papacy noted he delivered the blessing not from a studio window used by his predecessors, but from the central balcony. He wore a simple white cassock without the formal red cape, and instead of reciting the Latin Regina Caeli prayer, he sang it.\n\n\u201cI carry in my heart the sufferings of the beloved Ukrainian people,\u201d he said. \u201cLet everything possible be done to achieve genuine, just and lasting peace as soon as possible.\u201d Speaking amid renewed international pressure on Russia to halt hostilities, Leo called for the release of war prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children to their families.\n\nHe also urged a ceasefire in Gaza, which Israeli forces have continued to pound, the return of hostages seized in the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, and humanitarian aid for the \u201cexhausted civilian population\u201d. Food and medicine shortages have left babies severely malnourished.\n\nLeo noted that many countries celebrated Mother\u2019s Day on Sunday and wished all mothers, \u201cincluding those in heaven\u201d, a happy Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nEarlier, he celebrated a private mass in the grottoes beneath St Peter\u2019s, which contain the tombs of previous popes. On Saturday, Leo crossed Rome to pray at the tomb of Francis, who broke with tradition by asking to be buried at the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. Leo\u2019s formal installation mass is due next Sunday, 18 May.",

        "body": "Vladimir Putin has rejected an ultimatum by European leaders to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine or face increased sanctions, but has proposed holding direct negotiations with Kyiv this week.\n\nThe leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland told the Russian president either to sign up to an unconditional ceasefire by Monday or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cAll of us here, together with the US, are calling Putin out. If he\u2019s serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it now,\u201d said UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, at a joint press conference of the five leaders in Kyiv.\n\nStarmer said the leaders were demanding \u201can unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Putin\u2019s conditions, and [are] clear that if he turns his back on peace, we will respond, working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions, and increase our military aid for Ukraine\u2019s defence to pressure Russia back to the table.\u201d\n\n0:53 European leaders call for unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine \u2013 video\n\nStarmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz arrived in the Ukrainian capital on the same train on Saturday morning, while Donald Tusk travelled on a separate train. The leaders met Zelenskyy for talks in central Kyiv. It is Macron\u2019s first visit to Kyiv since summer 2022, and the first visit for Merz as chancellor, having only taken office this week.\n\n\u201cAll five leaders had a fruitful call with @POTUS focused on peace efforts,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, wrote on X, adding a picture of the five men gathered around a mobile phone on speaker mode.\n\nSybiha added: \u201cUkraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on Monday. If Russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured, a durable ceasefire and confidence-building measures can pave the way to peace negotiations.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s response to the ultimatum came in a press briefing for Russian media and western television networks, held in the Kremlin close to 2am local time on Sunday morning. Putin rejected the calls for a ceasefire, but said he was ready for direct negotiations with Ukraine.\n\nHe suggested delegations from the two countries could meet in Istanbul this Thursday to begin talks. \u201cWe don\u2019t exclude that during these negotiations we will be able to agree on new ceasefires,\u201d Putin said.\n\nMacron said on Sunday that Putin\u2019s talks proposal was \u201ca first step, but not enough\u201d. \u201cAn unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations,\u201d the French president said, adding that the Russian leader was \u201clooking for a way out, but he still wants to buy time\u201d.\n\nUkraine and European capitals have previously demanded a full ceasefire as a precondition to starting negotiations. Putin left the briefing, for which journalists had been kept waiting for up to seven hours, without answering any questions.\n\nThere was no immediate readout from the White House on the call, or on whether Trump had made specific commitments if Putin rejects the ceasefire.\n\nTrump and the US administration have said a 30-day ceasefire could be the first step on the way to a sustainable peace deal. Ukraine has said it is ready to implement such a ceasefire, but Russia has so far refused, saying it would only do so if all western weapons deliveries to Ukraine were halted.\n\nView image in fullscreen Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer in Kyiv, Ukraine. Photograph: Thomas Peter/Reuters\n\nIn an early sign that Russia may not be receptive to the latest ultimatum, the hawkish former president, Dmitry Medvedev, wrote on X: \u201cMacron, Merz, Starmer, and Tusk were supposed to discuss peace in Kyiv. Instead, they are blurting out threats against Russia \u2026 You think that\u2019s smart, eh? Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses.\u201d\n\nInstead, Moscow unilaterally declared a three-day ceasefire beginning on 8 May, which Kyiv said was designed to avoid Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia during celebrations of 80 years of the Soviet victory in the second world war, held in Moscow on Friday.\n\nThousands of troops marched through Red Square for the annual Victory Day parade, with numerous world leaders in attendance, most notably China\u2019s Xi Jinping, and the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Robert Fico and Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, the prime minister of EU member Slovakia and the president of EU hopeful Serbia, respectively, also attended the parade, drawing irritation from other European leaders.\n\nFighting has continued along the frontlines during the supposed ceasefire, both sides have said, but Russia has largely refrained from drone and missile attacks on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cPutin didn\u2019t need conditions when he wanted a ceasefire to have a parade, and he doesn\u2019t need them now. Ukraine has shown the willingness to engage again and again, but again and again Putin has refused,\u201d said Starmer.\n\nStarmer said Putin had drawn the wrong lessons from the second world war. \u201cWe understand the lessons of history, the lesson that any veteran of Normandy or north Africa or of any other campaign will tell you, but that Putin has not yet grasped. There is no glory in aggression and conquest, glory comes from fighting for your country, defending the people, and winning the peace,\u201d he said.\n\nView image in fullscreen L-R: Friedrich Merz, Emmanuel Macron, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Olena Zelenska, Keir Starmer and Donald Tusk in Maidan Square. Photograph: WPA/Getty Images\n\nMacron also referenced VE Day, and said that \u201cthe defence of the principles on which our continent and, more generally, the international order is based\u201d was at stake in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe four European leaders visited Kyiv\u2019s Maidan on Saturday morning with Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena Zelenska. Thousands of flags have been erected in the central square to remember those killed in the war with Russia. The leaders paid their respects and had a moment of silence, before heading to the talks with Zelenskyy. The five then had a virtual meeting with other leaders on progress being made for a so-called \u201cair, land, maritime and regeneration force\u201d that is planned to be part of a peace deal.\n\nTrump has yet to comment publicly on his conversation with the group of leaders. On Friday, he was asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he had a message for Putin. \u201cI have a message for both parties: get this war ended,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cGet this stupid war finished. That\u2019s my message for both of them.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has so far appeared to be much tougher on Kyiv than Moscow, but there are some small signals that the mood in Washington might be changing, after a positive meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Vatican on the sidelines of the pope\u2019s funeral.\n\nEven the vice-president, JD Vance, seen as the most sceptical of voices on support for Ukraine, has criticised Moscow\u2019s stance in recent days. \u201cRight now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they\u2019re asking for too much,\u201d he said this week.\n\nThe US embassy in Kyiv put out a public warning late on Friday night that it had received intelligence of a \u201cpotentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days\u201d. It did not give further details, but it later emerged that Russia will close its airspace over the Kapustin Yar missile testing range on Monday and Tuesday, which could indicate the potential launch of ballistic missiles.",

        "body": "Donald Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury plane described to be a \u201cpalace in the sky\u201d being offered to the US president as a gift from Qatar\u2019s royal family, almost immediately igniting accusations of bribery and corruption as well as commensurate criticism.\n\nA statement from Qatar on Sunday acknowledged it had held discussions with the US about \u201cthe possible transfer\u201d of a plane to be used temporarily by Trump as his presidential aircraft, usurping Air Force One. But the emirate\u2019s statement denied a final decision over the transfer had been made \u2013 or that it was a gift.\n\nOn Sunday, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, ABC reported that the Trump administration was girding itself to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8, a jumbo jet from the Qatari royals that was estimated to be about $400m. Trump would then use the 13-year-old plane as the new Air Force One until shortly before the conclusion of his second Oval Office stint, at which point it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation no later than 1 January 2029.\n\nThe luxury gift from Qatar was expected to be announced next week during Trump\u2019s three-day tour of the Middle East that includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, ABC reported. Yet a Qatari spokesperson said it was \u201cinaccurate\u201d to say that the jet would be gifted \u201cduring the upcoming visit of president Trump\u201d.\n\nTrump toured the opulent plane in February while it was parked at the West Palm Beach international airport, ABC added.\n\nAssuming Trump accepts the plane as planned, the jumbo jet would first be transferred to the US air force so the military branch could configure the aircraft to meet the specifications required for presidential travel, ABC\u2019s sources told the network. The network added that any costs affiliated with its transfer would be paid for by the US air force, which receives a significant portion of the revenue generated by federal taxpayers.\n\nAccording to ABC\u2019s sources, Trump\u2019s attorney general Pam Bondi and his top White House lawyer David Warrington have pre-emptively concluded that it is \u201clegally permissible\u201d for Trump to accept the luxury gift and then transfer it over to his presidential library.\n\nBoth reportedly arrived at that conclusion after lawyers for the White House counsel\u2019s office as well as the justice department said the gifted plane was not conditioned on any official act and therefore was not bribery.\n\nThose lawyers drafted an analysis for defense secretary Pete Hegseth which reiterated that nothing about the plane violated federal laws prohibiting US government officials accepting gifts from foreign states or their royals. In fact, ABC\u2019s sources said, Bondi\u2019s reading of the situation was that the plane was being given to the US air force and then Trump\u2019s presidential library foundation rather than her boss himself.\n\nNevertheless, reports of the highly unusual \u2013 if not unprecedented \u2013 gift that Trump\u2019s subordinates had afforded their blessing for him to receive triggered a wave of criticisms towards the president.\n\nThe Democratic senator Chuck Schumer quickly mocked Trump\u2019s political slogan of \u201cAmerica first\u201d.\n\n\u201cNothing says \u2018America First\u2019 like Air Force One, brought to you by Qatar,\u201d the US Senate minority leader from New York said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not just bribery \u2013 it\u2019s premium foreign influence with extra legroom.\u201d\n\nOn X, Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland said: \u201cTrump must seek Congress\u2019 consent to take this $300m from Qatar. The Constitution is perfectly clear: no present of any kind whatever\u2019 from a foreign state without Congressional permission. A gift you use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift (and a grift).\u201d\n\nDemocratic pollster Matt McDermott echoed similar sentiments, saying: \u201cLiterally speechless\u2026\n\n\u201cA foreign regime gifting a jet to a former president. It\u2019s bribery in broad daylight.\u201d\n\nMcDermott remarked that the Trump Organization run by the president\u2019s children only days earlier had announced a new $5.5bn golf course in Qatar.\n\n\u201cToday: Qatar \u2018gifts\u2019 Trump a luxury jet. Surely just a coincidence,\u201d McDermott said.\n\nMeanwhile, Harvard University international security professor Juliette Kayyem said: \u201cThe surveillance and security aspects are also as disturbing as the grift.\u201d\n\nThe CNN security analyst added that \u201cQatar will surely offer a plane that satisfies their needs as well.\u201d\n\nCNN medical analyst Jonathan Reiner took to X and said: \u201cAir Force One is a (checks notes) Air Force plane. A military aircraft. It\u2019s not intended to be a palace because the US doesn\u2019t have a king.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman and prolific Trump scoopster wrote that the plane in question was \u201clikely the most expensive gift from a foreign government in US history and will likely raise questions from legal experts\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cIf Trump continued using it out of office, it would give him access to a much more modern plane than Trump Force One,\u201d which is a private Boeing 757 built in 1991 that belongs to the organization run by his sons.",

        "body": "Donald Trump this week will embark on the first foreign trip of his second administration with a tour of the Middle East, as he looks to secure investment, trade and technology deals from friendly leaders with deep pockets amid turbulent negotiations around numerous regional conflicts, including Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\n\nThe tour through the Middle East is largely a repeat of his first international trip in 2017, when he was feted in the region as a transactional leader eager to secure quick wins and capable of providing support for the regional monarchies\u2019 economic and geopolitical interests.\n\nHis negotiations in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will focus on a number of topics, including oil and trade, investment deals, the regional conflicts in Israel-Gaza and Yemen, and negotiations over the Iran nuclear programme among other issues.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s key goal is to come out of the region saying that he put America first, say observers.\n\n\u201cI think what he\u2019s clearly looking to get out of this is deals, the announcement of multiple multi-billion dollar deals,\u201d said Steven A Cook, the senior fellow for Middle East and Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s approach to foreign policy is heavily influenced by \u2026 his version of economic statecraft, which is to look towards the wealthy states in the Gulf and their very large sovereign wealth funds as sources of investment in the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has already announced Saudi Arabia\u2019s commitment to invest $1tn into the US economy and is hoping to secure big-ticket investments on Monday\u2019s visit. That would be consistent with his \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy of prioritising domestic interests, Cook said.\n\nThose countries may also seek access to advanced US semiconductor exports, and Saudi Arabia will want to ink a deal on civilian nuclear infrastructure, which had previously been tied to the country\u2019s normalisation of relations with Israel. In a departure from previous policy, the Trump administration has indicated the two issues are no longer linked.\n\nThe Middle East trip is notable for the US president\u2019s lack of plans to visit Israel, where Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet have floated plans to launch a larger invasion of Gaza and expel the Palestinian population there in what critics have called a broad plan of ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe Israel-Gaza war will loom large over the negotiations, as Saudi Arabia has said it will not normalise relations with Israel unless there is a clear path to a two-state solution, and many countries in the Middle East have spoken out against a proposal that began with Trump to expel Palestinian from Gaza to other Arab countries.\n\n\u201cHe could have gone to Israel like he did last time,\u201d said Elliot Abrams, former deputy national security adviser under George W Bush and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He added that Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, had cancelled a planned trip to Israel. \u201cI think there\u2019s some tension here \u2026 [Israel] knows that Trump is going to be spending a week in the Gulf hearing about Gaza, Gaza, Gaza, Gaza every day. So it\u2019s not the best moment in US-Israel or Trump-Israel relations.\u201d\n\nThere is a growing understanding in Washington and Israel that Trump has taken a step back from attempting to mediate the war in Gaza. His administration said that they would negotiate a new aid deal without the direct involvement of the Israeli government to renew deliveries of aid into Gaza, which is suffering its worst humanitarian crisis of the war since a ceasefire collapsed in March.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only one who speaks the same language as Netanyahu, and he\u2019s the only one who can speak to Netanyahu in a language that Netanyahu will understand,\u201d said Ami Ayalon, a former director of the Israel Security Agency, also known as the Shin Bet.\n\n\u201cTrump again, when it comes to to the hostages, when it comes to our relations in the Palestinians, has become the center of everything in the Middle East,\u201d he said.\n\nThat turns Trump\u2019s attention to the things he can get done.\n\nHe has said that he plans to decide on his trip to Saudi Arabia on an announcement that the US could refer to the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia rather than the Persian Gulf.\n\nThat has angered Iran at a moment when the Gulf states appear largely in support of US efforts in talks on the future of the Iranian nuclear programme. As opposed to 2017, the Gulf states have largely spoken in support of renewed negotiations between the United States and Iran over the nuclear programme, but those governments were said to be unclear on the details of any deal as of yet.\n\n\u201cUS partners have confided to me that there are US statements on all of these issues, but they don\u2019t yet see US policies,\u201d said Jon Alterman, the director of the Middle East Program at CSIS, a thinktank. \u201cThe US government doesn\u2019t speak with one voice and its actions remain uncoordinated.\u201d\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, Trump has enlisted his son-in-law Jared Kushner to act as a point man for the discussions ahead of the trip, CNN has reported. Kushner, who was Trump\u2019s envoy to the region during his first administration, is said to be tasked with making progress in discussions of Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham accords. But his role is also tainted by a perceived conflict of interest given his family\u2019s business interests in the region.\n\nYet with such a complicated tableau of economic and geopolitical interests in the region, there are questions about whether the Trump administration has the focus and the team to pursue a comprehensive policy in the region. Many in Trump\u2019s orbit say that US policy should place lower priority on the Middle East, and focus instead on China and the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n\u201cI think the sense that there\u2019s these pieces that the President is negotiating don\u2019t respond together, and that his priority really is essentially domestic focus, securing, you know, agreements to invest in the estates,\u201d said Cook. \u201cRegionally, the president would like these issues to go away, and that\u2019s why he has these compressed timelines he doesn\u2019t want to focus on.\u201d",

        "body": "Siwar Ashour was born into war and hunger and has known nothing else. She is now in real danger of dying without ever having known a moment of peace or contentment.\n\nThe six-month-old Palestinian girl, whose painfully emaciated body symbolised the deliberate starvation of Gaza when she appeared on the BBC this week, was only 2.5kg when she was born on 20 November last year.\n\nFrom birth, Siwar had a problem with her oesophagus that has made it hard for her to drink breast milk and left her dependent on specialised formula, which is in critically short supply.\n\nHer parents\u2019 home in al-Nuseirat, halfway up the coast on the Gaza Strip, was bombed earlier in the war, which began in October 2023 when Hamas killed 1,200 people in Israel, leading to an Israeli assault that has so far killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza. They lived in tents for a while but it was almost impossible to get food or water in the camp and it also came under Israeli fire.\n\nThey tried going back to al-Nuseirat to stay at Siwar\u2019s grandparents\u2019 home, but that was bombed, too. All that was left of the building was a single room, which they shared with 11 other people. That was where Siwar was born.\n\nView image in fullscreen Siwar has struggled to breastfeed and is unable to tolerate many different kinds of formula. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI was exhausted all the time. There was no privacy, and I couldn\u2019t get any rest,\u201d Najwa Aram, Siwar\u2019s 23-year-old mother said. \u201cThere was no food or proper nutrition, and when I gave birth to her, she was not like other babies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen she was born, she was beautiful despite the weakness visible on her features,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now she is unnaturally thin. Babies her age are supposed to weigh six kilograms6kg or more \u2013 not just 2 to 4kg.\u201d\n\nNajwa found out last month she was pregnant with her second child, but lives in terror of losing Siwar before her brother or sister is born. She has moved to Khan Younis to stay with her mother, but has spent most of the past few months in hospital with her frail daughter.\n\nHer husband, Saleh, is blind, and had to stay behind in al-Nuseirat. The relentless bombing has forced the family to move several times, like almost all families in Gaza, and has torn them apart.\n\n\u201cEven though Siwar\u2019s father is blind, he used to play with her a lot. He visited us in the hospital only once, as he cannot move without someone accompanying him,\u201d Najwa said. \u201cHe fears for her even more than I do \u2013 he is deeply attached to her.\u201d\n\nThe family has no source of income so relies on charity kitchens for food and some humanitarian aid, but that too is in desperately short supply as Israel\u2019s total blockade of Gaza approaches the 70-day mark. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN relief agency, Unrwa, said this week: \u201cthe manmade and politically motivated starvation in Gaza is an expression of absolute cruelty\u201d.\n\nNajwa and her mother have a single sack of flour left, as well as a few tins.\n\n\u201cOnce this runs out, we won\u2019t be able to buy anything due to the high prices,\u201d Najwa said. Even more critically, supplies of the special milk formula that Siwar needs are harder and harder to find.\n\n\u201cI am also suffering from malnutrition. Still, I try to breastfeed Siwar, but she refuses and continues to cry, completely rejecting me,\u201d Najwa said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve had to rely more on formula milk. When I used to breastfeed her, one can of formula would last a month. Now it runs out in less than a week.\u201d\n\nNajwa and her daughter spent much of March in hospital in Deir al-Balah, where there was a milk formula that seemed to work, bringing Siwar\u2019s weight up to 4kg.\n\n\u201cI noticed that Siwar started to smile and play, which made me happy and gave me hope that her health might improve.\u201d\n\nBut that fragile moment of hope crumbled when they were discharged, and Siwar started losing weight again. She was referred to Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, where mother and daughter remain, for now.\n\n\u201cThe doctors are doing everything they can to take care of her, but she also doesn\u2019t tolerate the formula they prepare for her,\u201d Najwa said. \u201cThe hospital situation is bad. There are six patients in each room. Everywhere you look, there is suffering. There\u2019s a child in worse condition than Siwar.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing my daughter in this state every day gives me insomnia,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m constantly anxious and overthinking. Sometimes I can\u2019t bear seeing her like this, and I start crying. I\u2019m so afraid of losing her. Can\u2019t the world open the crossings to allow in milk, food, and medicine. All I want is for my daughter Siwar to live like the rest of the children in the world.\u201d\n\nDr Ahmed al-Farah, the director of the children\u2019s and maternity building at the Nasser medical complex, said between five and 10 new malnutrition cases are being recorded there every day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing severe cases. Malnutrition appears in children in a horrifying and extremely visible way,\u201d Farah said. \u201cWe have nothing to offer them. They need proteins, but there are none. We try to provide a little milk, perhaps powdered milk, but we can\u2019t offer anything more.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, the severe overcrowding in hospitals leads to increased disease transmission among children,\u201d he added.\n\nThere is only enough fuel left at the Nasser complex to keep the generators going for another 48 hours. They have already had to shut off electricity on the administrative floors to make it last a little bit longer, but the power supply will soon have to be cut to the overcrowded patients\u2019 wards.\n\n\u201cWe are helpless in the face of their needs \u2013 we cannot provide food, supplements, medication, or vitamins appropriate for their conditions,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cI studied malnutrition in medical school textbooks. I used to think that study would remain theoretical, something we\u2019d never see in real life. But now, those textbook descriptions have come to life before our eyes in Gaza,\u201d Farah said.\n\n\u201cI call on the world to see us as human beings \u2013 we were created just like everyone else.\u201d",

        "body": "India and Pakistan have both claimed victory after a ceasefire was declared over the weekend, which brought the two nuclear-nations back from the brink of war.\n\nAfter days of escalating clashes that culminated in both sides launching missile and drone strikes on each other\u2019s major military bases \u2013 the closest they had come to full-scale war in decades \u2013 the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was declared by Donald Trump on Saturday evening.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump further congratulated the two countries on \u201chaving the strength, wisdom and fortitude to fully know and understand that it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much\u201d.\n\nWithin hours of the truce announcement, there were fears it had fallen apart after firing restarted along the disputed border in Kashmir and missiles and drones were once again launched into Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nHowever, by Sunday morning things were quiet on both sides of the frontier, leading many to hope the fragile peace would hold. Each side accused the other of triggering the violations and Pakistan said it remained \u201ccommitted to faithful implementation of ceasefire\u201d.\n\nThe Indian army said in a press briefing it had conveyed a message, through its \u201chotline\u201d with Pakistan, that if there were any more cross-border provocations \u201cour firm and clear intent to respond to these fiercely\u201d.\n\nBoth India and Pakistan claimed the ceasefire as a victory, fuelling a surge of nationalistic fervour on both sides of the border. India\u2019s defence minister, Rajnath Singh, said on Sunday the \u201croar of Indian forces reached Rawalpindi, the very headquarters of the Pakistani army\u201d.\n\nHe said the military offensive, named Operation Sindoor, was \u201cnot just a military action but a symbol of India\u2019s political, social and strategic willpower\u201d.\n\nIn Pakistan, parades were held near the border to shower the military with petals, and the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, declared 11 May to be a day \u201cin recognition of the armed forces\u2019 response to recent Indian aggression\u201d.\n\nWriting in Pakistan\u2019s Dawn newspaper, commentator Baqir Sajjad called the ceasefire a \u201ccalculated victory\u201d by Pakistan that \u201cfirmly denied a much stronger India the military edge and diplomatic narrative it sought to dominate\u201d.\n\nParties and rallies were held across the country to mark the day, particularly in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, which was on the frontline of weeks of aggressive cross-border shelling.\n\nRaja Farooq Haider Khan, a former leader of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, led a celebratory rally near the disputed Kashmir border. \u201cWe are celebrating the bravery of our armed forces today who defended us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe offered his gratitude to Trump for helping to resolve the conflict. \u201cThis time we were so close to war so his involvement was very welcome. But we have to say that without resolving the Kashmir issue long-term, peace can\u2019t prevail in the region.\u201d\n\nSahad, a resident in Neelum Valley in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, said the past few days had been the scariest of her life. \u201cNo one can be happier than us as we live under the shadow of border posts and Indian firings. Everyone is happy to have our normal lives back,\u201d she said.\n\nThere were also celebrations on the Indian side of the border. However, residents near the disputed frontier said that while a ceasefire was welcome, it did not solve the underlying problem of the often bloody dispute between India and Pakistan over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which goes back to the partition of India in 1947.\n\nLal Din, 55, a resident of Poonch, the worst-affected area along India\u2019s border in Kashmir, where hundreds of houses were destroyed and dozens killed in the cross-border fire, said Kashmiris has seen this same situation \u2013 \u201ctemporary ceasefires brokered by global powers\u201d \u2013 many times before.\n\n\u201cThe core issue remains unresolved \u2013 soldiers still face each other with weapons and tanks,\u201d he said. \u201cToday it was one dispute, tomorrow it will be another, and the guns will roar again, trapping civilians like me in the crossfire. We\u2019re just numbers in this clash of nuclear powers. I beg both sides: resolve your differences, live in peace, and let us live.\u201d\n\nAfter weeks of mounting tensions, the attacks this week began on Wednesday when Indian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people. India has said those strikes were aimed at \u201cterrorist infrastructure and terrorist training camps\u201d as retribution for an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which it blamed on Pakistani-backed extremists.\n\nThe situation escalated further after India accused Pakistan of two consecutive nights of drone attacks.\n\nThe US took sizeable credit for brokering Saturday\u2019s ceasefire, with Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, and JD Vance, the vice-president, reported to have spent 48 hours embroiled in intense diplomatic negotiations with the two countries, finally convincing them to lay down arms on Saturday. Other countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UK, were also credited.\n\nVance had initially said the US would not interfere in the escalating hostilities between the US and Pakistan, claiming it was \u201cnone of our business\u201d. However, according to sources, their attitude shifted after concerns were raised by US intelligence that the conflict posed a risk of escalating into a full nuclear threat.\n\nThe reportedly pro-active role played by the US in the ceasefire, including phone calls made by Trump himself, seemed to have piqued the president\u2019s interest in the subcontinent and he pledged to substantially increase trade with both India and Pakistan.\n\nAt a press briefing on Sunday, Indian military spokespeople offered more details on its offensive against Pakistan and claimed it was Pakistan that had first requested a ceasefire.\n\nIndia said five of its soldiers were killed by Pakistani firing over the border and claimed Pakistan lost about 40 solders in firing along the line of control. It also claimed to have killed 100 terrorists living over the border in Pakistan. The numbers could not be verified.\n\nIt also claimed to have \u201cdowned a few Pakistani planes\u201d, though it did not elaborate further. Asked about claims made by Pakistan, and backed up by expert analysis of debris, that Pakistani missiles had downed at least three Indian military jets during the offensive on Wednesday, including multimillion-dollar French Rafale jets, India said \u201closses are a part of conflict\u201d and that all its pilots had returned home.",

The ban would stay in place until a special tribunal completes a trial of the party and its leaders over the deaths of hundreds of students and other protesters during an anti-government uprising in July and August last year.\n\n\u201cThis decision is aimed at ensuring national security and sovereignty, protection of activists of the July movement, and plaintiffs and witnesses involved in the tribunal proceedings,\u201d Nazrul told reporters after a special cabinet meeting.\n\nNazrul said the meeting on Saturday also expanded scope for trying any political parties involving charges of killing during the anti-Hasina protest being handled by the international crimes tribunal.\n\nHe said a government notification regarding the ban would be published soon with details.\n\nHasina and many of her senior party colleagues have been accused of murder in many cases after her ouster last year. She has been in exile in India since 5 August as her official residence was stormed by protesters soon after she left the country.\n\nThe UNs human rights office said in a report in February that up to 1,400 people may have been killed during three weeks of anti-Hasina protest.\n\nSaturday night\u2019s dramatic decision came after thousands of protesters, including supporters of a newly formed political party by students, took to the streets in Dhaka and issued an ultimatum to ban the Awami League party by Saturday night. The members of the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party also prominently took part in the protest.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Hasina or her party, but the chief of the Jatiya Nagorik or National Citizen party, Nahid Islam, who is also a student leader, applauded the Yunus-led government for its decision.\n\nThe student-led uprising ended Hasina\u2019s 15 years of rule, and three days after her fall Yunus took office as interim leader.",

        "body": "Mr Bates vs the Post Office took centre stage at the Bafta television awards on Sunday, being praised for showcasing the power of television to \u201cchange hearts and minds\u201d and forcing positive change.\n\nThe show won best limited drama, ITV was given a special award for commissioning the show, and BBC One won the current affairs gong for a Post Office special on BBC Breakfast.\n\n\u201cThis story only had the impact it did because the people that watched it stood up and demanded action with rage,\u201d said the drama\u2019s producer Patrick Spence in his acceptance speech. \u201cMay it be a warning to those who are supposed to have our backs. We cannot abide liars and bullies.\u201d\n\nHe thanked audiences for their engagement in the series. \u201cOur show didn\u2019t change the law, the people of this nation did that,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Bates vs the Post Office won in a category thought to be tightly contested, up against Baby Reindeer. The ITV drama spotlighted one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British history, influenced policy change in government and reopened the case to seek justice for post office operators wrongly accused of theft and fraud.\n\n\u201cIt spoke to a nation, it gave a voice to the wronged, and it brought dynamic change,\u201d said the actor and politician Floella Benjamin before she presented ITV with the special award.\n\nITV\u2019s director of television, Kevin Lygo, used his speech in collecting the award to push public service broadcasters. \u201cAt a time when funding is tricky but not impossible, ITV and the BBC must continue to make these stories which hold power to account,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to make them. As long as we are here, we will continue to do it.\u201d\n\nHe signed off by demanding payouts for wronged post office operators who have not yet received funds from a compensation scheme. \u201cWill you hurry up and pay these people what they are due,\u201d he said in a message to the government.\n\nThe Bafta chair, Sara Putt, commended the show in the opening speech of the night. \u201cThis is public service television at its best and shows the power of TV to change hearts and minds,\u201d she told the ceremony at the Royal Festival Hall in London.\n\nPutt also called for more gender equality and recognition of disabled people in television. \u201cThe talent is there; we need to create access to the pipelines that recognise, support and highlight that talent,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was a good night for the public service broadcasters and a bad one for Netflix. The BBC won most of the biggest scripted television awards, picking up six for Mr Loverman, Industry, Blue Lights, Alma\u2019s Not Normal and Gavin & Stacey. Channel 4 snapped up the reality gong in a surprise win for The Jury: Murder Trial, pipping The Traitors which many thought would win.\n\nIn Netflix\u2019s corner was Baby Reindeer, which had been expected to win big but left with only one award: Jessica Gunning for supporting actress.\n\nThe leading actress Bafta went to the rising star Marisa Abela for her portrayal of Yasmin in the finance drama Industry. She was holding back tears of joy reading her speech. \u201cI booked Industry when I was in my final year of drama school and my agent who signed me in my first final year show is here tonight \u2013 Saskia, thank you so much for believing in me,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of the biggest surprises of the night came as the Northern Irish police drama Blue Lights picked up the drama series Bafta. \u201cThank you to the people of our home city for letting us tell your stories,\u201d said the writer Declan Lawn. \u201cBelfast, this one\u2019s for you.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Lennie James and Marisa Abela with their Baftas. Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Bafta\n\nLennie James won the leading actor award for his portrayal of Barrington Walker in Mr Loverman, the story of a closeted Antiguan Londoner whose marriage collapses after it emerges he has been having a decades-long affair with his male best friend. James\u2019s voice quaked when he thanked Bernardine Evaristo, who wrote the novel on which the show is based, for \u201ctrusting us with your characters. What a night!\u201d\n\nAriyon Bakare won supporting actor for his turn as Morris De La Roux, the secret gay partner of Walker in Mr Loverman. Fighting back tears, Bakare said: \u201cThis award stands on the shoulders of those before me, those who have been afraid to come out, to be who they want to be. I hope you feel just as confident as we did when we made the show.\u201d\n\nAfter a sweltering sun had lit up London\u2019s South Bank during the day, stars took over on the night. British television\u2019s biggest names swaggered down the red carpet and into the Royal Festival Hall. Some stopped for interviews and all stopped for photographs, the atmosphere buzzing as stars paraded down the carpet in flamboyant dress.\n\nThe opening award of the night was Gunning\u2019s for supporting actress, for playing the stalker Martha in Baby Reindeer. She teared up thanking her team and the show\u2019s creator Richard Gadd, telling the audience the show had changed her life. \u201cThis time last year, Richard and I were stood backstage waiting to go out to present an award,\u201d she said. \u201cLittle did we know what the year had in store for us.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Kirsty Wark onstage during the ceremony. Photograph: John Phillips/Getty Images for Bafta\n\nThe journalist Kirsty Wark accepted a Bafta lifetime achievement award for her outstanding contribution to news and current affairs broadcasting. She looked back on her career in her speech. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky to interview everyone from politicians to painters, architects to economists. It takes a village to raise a programme,\u201d she said.\n\nDanny Dyer scooped up the male performance in a comedy award for his role as Lee in Mr Bigstuff. \u201cThe acting was so bad, it was funny,\u201d he joked in his speech. Dropping out expletives and cupping his mouth as they fell, he finished by speaking directly to his daughters in the audience: \u201cI done it, girls, I fuckin\u2019 done it.\u201d\n\nRuth Jones won female performance in a comedy for her portrayal of Nessa in Gavin and Stacey. She arrived on stage in character and joked to the ceremony: \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, this is immense. I wasn\u2019t expecting this, no way. I won a Bafta before, of course I did, in 1976: the Barry arcade fruity technician award \u2013 it was crackin\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe became Ruth Jones again after a chorus of laughter from the crowd. \u201cThe person I would like to thank the most is my dear, dear, talented, lovely, funny friend James Corden, with whom I have shared this astonishing journey for the past 17 years, and without whom Vanessa Shanessa Jenkins would not exist.\u201d\n\nUkraine: Enemy in the Woods won in the single documentary category. \u201cPeople are still fighting out there and we\u2019re just really proud that we were able to tell these stories,\u201d said Jamie Roberts, the programme\u2019s director. \u201cI hope we can continue to make documentaries like this. It\u2019s what we live for.\u201d",

Taking it away now, with no warning, no funding, and no alternative, is not just shortsighted \u2013 it\u2019s cruel.\u201d\n\nUnison, the UK\u2019s biggest union representing health and care workers, also criticised the decision and called for urgent clarity on what the changes meant for those already working in the UK.\n\nChristina McAnea, Unison\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe NHS and the care sector would have collapsed long ago without the thousands of workers who\u2019ve come to the UK from overseas.\n\n\u201cMigrant health and care staff already here will now be understandably anxious about what\u2019s to happen to them. The government must reassure these overseas workers they\u2019ll be allowed to stay and continue with their indispensable work.\u201d\n\nShe urged ministers to stop describing care jobs as \u201clow skilled\u201d and said the government must \u201cget on with making its fair pay agreement a reality\u201d.\n\nIn 2023, more than 58,000 overseas care workers came to the UK on skilled worker visas \u2013 nearly half of all new entrants to the social care workforce.\n\nLabour has defended the policy as part of a wider reset of the immigration system, aimed at reducing reliance on overseas labour and investing in the domestic workforce.\n\nThe home secretary, Yvette Cooper, defended the policy during an interview on BBC\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. She argued employers should recruit from the existing pool of care workers already in the UK, including those who arrived on visas but were never placed in roles.\n\n\u201cThey can also extend existing visas.

        "title": "Nottinghamshire families left unaware of babies\u2019 blood test results in second NHS error",
        "body": "Hundreds of families in Nottinghamshire have potentially been left unaware of whether their babies may be carriers of certain genetic blood disorders, the second such NHS error to come to light since the start of this year.\n\nAbout 300 families whose children were born between 2004 and September 2024 in Bassetlaw and mid-Nottinghamshire were identified by the NHS as being affected.\n\nChanges in how genetic testing results were communicated to families meant they may not have been informed of whether their child was a carrier of a trait for sickle cell disease or for an unusual haemoglobin gene.\n\nNHS England said it has contacted the families affected directly by letter so that they understand what being a carrier means for them and their children.\n\nThe NHS has also said that since the error, changes have been made to the way blood results are communicated within the area to make it more robust. Nottingham University hospital\u2019s local haemoglobinopathy team is now delivering the screening result for sickle cell carrier status to parents of children in the whole of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire. Previously, this sickle cell notification pathway only covered the city and the south of the county.\n\nSickle cell disease primarily affects people from an African-Caribbean background. Testing for the sickle cell trait is important because although carriers do not have sickle cell disease symptoms, there is evidence they have additional medical needs, such as if they need an anaesthetic.\n\nThe sickle cell trait may affect women during pregnancy, and carriers can experience pain during intense physical activity and at high altitudes, research suggests. If two parents carry the sickle cell trait, there is a one in four chance their children will have sickle cell anaemia.\n\nIn January, the Guardian reported that an error by the NHS led to more than 800 families in Derbyshire not receiving the results of a heel prick test given to babies after birth, meaning they did not know whether their child was a carrier of a trait for sickle cell disease or for an unusual haemoglobin gene. NHS officials apologised \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d to the families affected, saying the error \u201cshouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d and that an investigation had been launched.\n\nJohn James, the chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: \u201cIt is unacceptable that, once again, families have not been informed of their children\u2019s newborn screening results.

It\u2019s been tough. Really tough. The most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done. But I couldn\u2019t be happier and more proud of finishing this epic adventure.\u201d\n\nHe thanked his guide Gelje Sherpa, a renowned Nepalese climber, and the production team who have been documenting his adventure, called Project Limitless. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, hard, amazing road to get here, but we finally did it,\u201d he said in a post on Instagram.\n\nHutchcraft joined the Royal Marines aged 21, after his father died, and served for six years, leaving in 2021.\n\nHe hopes to raise \u00a3500,000 for SavSim, a London-based wildlife conservation charity that uses animals and nature to provide mental health support to military veterans.\n\nView image in fullscreen On his bike (without his golden retriever).

It\u2019s been one hell of a journey.\u201d\n\nHe faced many challenges during his journey, including being knocked off his bike by a taxi, chased by wild dogs and held at gunpoint in Serbia.\n\nDuring his cycle from France to Turkey, he was joined by his three-year-old golden retriever, Buddy, who alternated between running alongside him and being pulled in a cycling carrier, which added 32kg to Hutchcraft\u2019s bike.",

        "title": "NHS nurses could go on strike over 25% erosion in pay, union boss warns",
        "body": "Nurses deserve a major pay rise to counter the 25% real terms erosion over the last 15 years and may go on strike again unless ministers dramatically improve their \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d 2.8% offer to NHS staff, the profession\u2019s leader has said.\n\nProf Nicola Ranger, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said nurses wanted full restoration of lost earnings and could \u201cbare our teeth\u201d in pursuit of that goal.\n\nHer remarks, in an interview with the Guardian, heighten the risk of a new wave of strikes in the months ahead by key staff unhappy with what they are being offered disrupting NHS care. The RCN\u2019s annual congress opens on Monday in Liverpool.\n\nResident doctors in England \u2013 formerly known as junior doctors \u2013 have already launched a ballot for a potential fresh round of strikes, after the 11 rounds they held in 2023 and 2024 when they were seeking a 35% rise. Their action won them a 22% salary uplift over the two years 2023-24 and 24-25.\n\nThe British Medical Association has warned Wes Streeting, the health secretary, that they will stage further walkouts for up to six months unless they get a 10% increase for 2025-26, which he says is unaffordable. They want the value of their pay restored to 2008 levels by 2027 and have said their \u201csuccessful action over previous years\u201d shows that strikes lead to better pay deals.\n\nRanger cited the junior doctors\u2019 strikes and outlined a similar demand to them \u2013 restoration of the value of nurses\u2019 incomes, which have fallen in real terms since 2010 due to inflation and low pay rises \u2013 in explaining why the 518,000 nurses working in the NHS across the UK deserve a 25% salary boost.\n\n\u201cNursing pay since 2010 in real terms has reduced by 25%. The junior doctors were very clear about pay restoration. We still believe in that as well. It\u2019s where we start. It\u2019s our starting point,\u201d she said, for this year\u2019s negotiations over what percentage rise nurses should get this year.\n\n\u201cWe want to start bringing nursing [pay] back to where it needs to be. The junior doctors, they went on strike 11 times. They were very successful in what they did.\n\n\u201cIf every nurse in every setting was to put down their tools even for one hour in every setting, the impact would be catastrophic. So if we\u2019re essential to patients in every setting, start to value us, start to recognise our worth and start to pay us accordingly. Nursing is undervalued, misunderstood and underpaid.\u201d\n\nAsked what the RCN would do if the government does not award what it regards as a fair amount, Ranger replied: \u201cWe will come to a point where we will start to have to bare our teeth and start looking at what we do.\u201d But, she added: \u201cThey don\u2019t want strike action; nor do we.\u201d\n\nRanger did not specify what size of rise this year would be acceptable and stressed that the union understood that restoration of the 25% lost income would have to happen over several years.\n\nNHS leaders said Ranger\u2019s warning shot was unhelpful to solving the issue of NHS pay, especially given the financial problems of the service in England.\n\nDanny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, who leads the NHS\u2019s side of pay negotiations, said: \u201cIt is imperative that the government takes a considered view on what to do next. It is also imperative that all trade unions, including the RCN, seek out dialogue rather than confrontation as a way to resolve their long-term aspirations for their members.\n\n\u201cNHS leaders want nurses and all their staff to receive sustainable long-term investment in their pay, reflecting the crucial roles they deliver for society and the nation. Such awards need, though, to be affordable.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted the round of budget cuts that England\u2019s 215 NHS trusts are having to make to comply with a brutal \u201creset\u201d ordered by Sir Jim Mackey, NHS England\u2019s new chief executive.\n\nNurses in England went on strike on eight days between December 2022 and May 2023. They later received a one-off payment of \u00a31,655-\u00a33,789 for 2022-23 and a 5% pay rise for 2023-24.\n\nGiven the big fall in numbers applying to be nurses and high numbers quitting early, Ranger said the government\u2019s plans to improve the NHS would fail unless Streeting gives nurses a significant pay uplift to help tackle the twin problems of recruitment and retention.\n\nMinisters in Scotland have offered NHS nurses, midwives and other staff there an 8% rise over the next two years \u2013 4.25% this year and 3.75% in 2026-27.\n\nThe NHS pay review body (PRB) covering the 1.38 million NHS staff on Agenda for Change terms and conditions UK-wide has advised ministers to give them close to 3%, slightly higher than the 2.8% the government has proposed. Doctors\u2019 and dentists\u2019 pay is decided by a separate pay advisory body. Ministers are considering how to respond to the PRB\u2019s recommendation.\n\nIn a further sign of tension over NHS pay, the union Unison, which represents tens of thousands of staff, is consulting members in England and Wales over their readiness to strike if the 2025-26 pay award \u201cfails to keep up with rising living costs\u201d.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThis government inherited a broken NHS with an overworked, undervalued and demoralised workforce. We hugely value the work of talented nurses and midwives, and through our plan for change we are rebuilding the NHS for the benefit of patients and staff, and ensuring nursing remains an attractive career choice.\n\n\u201cOne of the first acts of this government was to award nurses an above-inflation pay rise for the first time in years, because we recognise that their pay has been hit over previous years. We are carefully considering the recommendations from the NHS pay review body and will update as soon as possible.\u201d",

There must be an independent public inquiry into pig farming practices and regulatory failures.\u201d\n\nPiglets are regularly killed as part of the meat production process \u2013 if they are weak, sick or not growing fast enough to be profitable. However, there are strict rules about the methods used.\n\nThe use of blunt force trauma to kill piglets under 10kg was outlawed in 2022 after warnings from the UK\u2019s Animal Welfare Committee and the EU\u2019s Reference Centre for Animal Welfare. Both said the method was unreliable, inhumane, and unnecessary given available alternatives, including captive bolt guns.\n\nCranswick said the entire team at the farm had been suspended while an investigation takes place, as required by law.\n\nA Cranswick spokesperson said: \u201cThe welfare of the animals we rear is of the utmost importance and we are extremely disappointed to see the unacceptable lapse of welfare standards captured at Northmoor Farm.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US president is set to visit Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.\n\nTrump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz he will travel to Israel on Monday. \u201cRight now, the intention is to return Edan Alexander home to his family,\u201d Witkoff said.\n\nThe office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement: \u201cThe US has informed Israel of Hamas\u2019s intention to release soldier Edan Alexander as a gesture to the Americans, without conditions or anything in exchange. The US has conveyed to Israel that this is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of hostages according to the original Witkoff framework, which Israel has already accepted. Israel is preparing for the possibility that this effort will be implemented.\u201d\n\nThe statement made clear that Israel had not agreed to a ceasefire, and intends to continue its military assault on Gaza. \u201cIn accordance with Israel\u2019s policy, the negotiations will be held under fire, based on the commitment to achieve all of the objectives of the war,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said.\n\nIsrael will not be asked to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of Alexander, Axios reports, but will have to agree to a temporary ceasefire and a halt to drone flights over Gaza to allow Alexander to safely leave the enclave.\n\nAlexander\u2019s family said in a statement released by the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum: \u201cThe family confirms that it has been informed of Hamas\u2019s announcement and that it is in constant contact with the American government regarding the possibility of Edan\u2019s expected release in the coming days.\u201d\n\nAdam Boehler, the US special envoy for hostage affairs, told Reuters the planned release of Alexander was \u201ca positive step forward\u201d and asked for Hamas to also release of the bodies of four other Americans who have died in captivity in Gaza.\n\nAccording to Haaretz, the four dead Americans include two who were serving in the Israeli military, Omer Neutra, 21, and Itay Hen, 19, and two older Israeli-Americans, Judih Weinstein-Haggai, 70, and her husband Gad Haggai, 73, were living in the Israeli kibbutz Nir Oz on the Gaza border when it was raided by Hamas-led militants on 7 October.\n\nKhalil al-Hayya, a Hamas leader in Gaza, told the Associated PressHamas is ready to \u201cimmediately start intensive negotiation\u201d to reach a final deal that will end Israel\u2019s deadly war on Gaza.\n\nOver the last year and a half, Israeli forces have killed at least 52,800 Palestinians while forcibly displacing 2 million survivors \u2013 including babies \u2013 across the narrow strip amid widespread food and aid shortages due to Israeli restrictions.\n\nMeanwhile, 59 hostages remain in Gaza. According to Trump, just 21 remain alive.\n\nThe governments of Qatar and Egypt, which have been brokering talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza, said in a joint statement that Hamas\u2019s decision to release Alexander \u201cdemonstrates goodwill\u201d and is an \u201cencouraging\u201d step that could lead the parties back to the negotiating table.\n\nAlexander, who was born in Israel but raised in the US by Israeli parents, moved to Israel in 2022 after graduating high school and enlisted in the Israeli military.\n\nHis parents and two younger siblings still live in Tenafly, New Jersey.",

        "body": "The White House has announced that a trade deal with China has been struck after two days of talks in Geneva.\n\nThe announcement on Sunday came after the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told reporters that there had been \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in talks between his team and that of the Chinese vice-premier, He Lifeng, in Geneva on defusing the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies sparked by Donald Trump\u2019s 145% tariffs.\n\nAt a news conference later on Sunday, He, the top Chinese trade official, called the talks \u201ccandid\u201d and said substantive progress had been made to reach an \u201cimportant consensus\u201d, according to China\u2019s state-run media. The two sides will issue a joint statement agreed during the talks, the vice-premier said.\n\nIn televised remarks that were posted on social media by the White House, Bessent said he would give more details on Monday, \u201cbut I can tell you that the talks were productive\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to report that we\u2019ve made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks,\u201d Bessent told reporters.\n\nThe US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, who spoke alongside Bessent, suggested more strongly that a deal had been reached.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought,\u201d Greer said.\n\n\u201cJust remember why we\u2019re here in the first place,\u201d he added. \u201cThe United States has a massive $1.2tn trade deficit, so the president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we\u2019re confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to resolve, work toward resolving that national emergency.\u201d\n\nBessent said he had informed Trump of the progress of the talks.\n\nThe meeting was the first face-to-face interaction between Bessent, Greer and He since the world\u2019s two largest economies imposed tariffs well above 100% on each other\u2019s goods.\n\nAlthough Bessent has said the bilateral tariffs were too high and needed to come down in a de-escalation move, he did not offer any details of reductions agreed and took no questions from reporters.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday night, Trump wrote on his social media platform that the two sides were working on \u201ca total reset ... in a friendly, but constructive, manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany things discussed, much agreed to,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cWe want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!,\u201d Trump added. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, that China needs to be \u201copened\u201d to US business seemed to ignore a half century of trade between the two nations since one of his political heroes, Richard Nixon, visited China in 1972.\n\nThe US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, confirmed to CNN that the US will continue to keep \u201ca 10% baseline tariff to be in place for the foreseeable future\u201d even on imports from nations the US strikes new trade deals with.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen in all likelihood is that relationships are going to be rebooted. It looks like the Chinese are very very eager to play ball and renormalise things \u2026 they really want to rebuild a relationship that\u2019s great for both of us.\u201d\n\nLast week, Trump and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, announced a limited bilateral trade deal.\n\nHassett said the UK agreement provided a \u201creally exciting blueprint\u201d and that he had been briefed on 24 deals with other countries that are in the works. \u201cThey all look a little bit like the UK deal but each one is bespoke,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Lutnick dismissed reports of dock workers and truckers losing their jobs as a result of the tariffs.\n\n\u201cThis is just a China problem right now,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cThe rest of the world is 10% [tariffs]. So don\u2019t overdo it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrices are going to stay stable once this policy is done,\u201d Lutnick added.\n\nReuters contributed reporting",

        "body": "Trump administration homeland security officials were responsible for starting the confrontation on Friday at a New Jersey immigration jail that led to the arrest of Newark\u2019s mayor as well as threats to detain three members of Congress, the representatives said Sunday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union.\n\nThe Democratic Congress members Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez \u2013 all of New Jersey \u2013 visited the controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center known as Delaney Hall on Friday to inspect the facility. As they waited to enter Delaney Hall, Newark\u2019s mayor Ras Baraka arrived \u2013 and as he left the property, he was arrested outside by Ice officials accusing him of trespassing, leading to a commotion at the entrance of the jail.\n\nThere evidently was shoving and pushing between federal immigration officials and the members of Congress, which Watson Coleman, McIver and Menendez blamed on the immigration officials.\n\nOn CNN\u2019s State of the Union, the Congress members said immigration officials had ample opportunity to deescalate the situation before someone called in and instructed masked agents to arrest Baraka.\n\n\u201cThey created that confrontation, they created that chaos,\u201d McIver said.\n\nSince the ordeal on Friday at Delaney Hall, homeland security officials have accused the Congress members of staging a \u201cbizarre political stunt\u201d there while also accusing McIver of \u201cbodyslamming\u201d authorities at the scene.\n\nMcIver rejected those allegations.\n\n\u201cI honestly do not know how to bodyslam anyone,\u201d McIver said. \u201cThere\u2019s no video that supports me bodyslamming anyone.\n\n\u201cWe were simply there to do our job \u2013 there for an oversight visit.\u201d\n\nFor their part, officials have threatened to arrest the three members of Congress in connection with Friday\u2019s commotion at Delaney Hall. Watson Coleman told CNN on Sunday that those threats stemmed from the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cdetermination to intimidate people in this country\u201d.\n\nThe Delaney Hall facility was recently reopened by Ice, as the agency continues to expand its detention network to assist in the Trump administration\u2019s aspirations to carry out mass deportations. The facility operator says it has the capacity to detain 1,000 people.\n\nDelaney Hall is owned by Geo Group, a massive, private prison company with Ice facilities throughout the US. The Trump administration in February gave a 15-year contract worth $1bn to Geo Group to operate Delaney Hall.\n\nHowever, the new contract comes amid legal challenges to Ice detention in New Jersey. Newark\u2019s municipal government recently filed a lawsuit against Geo Group claiming that the company did not have the proper permits to operate the facility.\n\nThere is also a separate legal battle playing out in a federal appellate court related to private immigration detention in the state. In 2021, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy signed a law barring immigration detention in the state. Another private prison company, CoreCivic, which runs the only other immigration jail in the state, sued New Jersey\u2019s state government.\n\nCoreCivic received support from the Biden administration in its suit, and a federal judge ruled in favor of the company. The state challenged the federal judge\u2019s decision, and a federal appellate court heard arguments for the case only recently.",

The Iranian foreign ministry said the \u201ctalks had been difficult but detailed to better understand each side\u2019s positions\u201d.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said: \u201cWe have moved away from general areas to a great extent and have gone into details.

He added weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran\u2019s security doctrine.\n\nOne of the difficulties in the talks, he said, was the conflict between the US statements in and out of the negotiating room.\n\nHe added: \u201cIran may place restrictions on things such as its dimensions, size, level and amount in order to build trust, for example, in a period similar to the previous period\u201d \u2013 a reference to the restrictions placed on the purity and stocks of Iran\u2019s enriched uranium under the original nuclear deal signed in 2015.\n\nFurther talks were likely in a week, Araghchi said. US president Donald Trump quit the nuclear deal in 2018, and politically needs to show any new agreement places tight restrictions on Iran.\n\nAhead of the talks there had been fears of a breakdown as the US administration slowly gravitated towards adopting a harder public line. US special envoy Steve Witkoff implied the US would never allow Iran to benefit from the peaceful technology of uranium enrichment, saying all its technology must be dismantled and destroyed.\n\nIsrael remains in the background of the talks, repeatedly urging Trump not to trust Iran and instead end any ambiguity about the true purpose of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme by destroying it altogether militarily.\n\nWitkoff said on Friday: \u201cAn enrichment programme can never exist in the state of Iran again. That\u2019s our red line. No enrichment.\u201d\n\nAraghchi called on the US side to stop making demands through the media, saying it made the negotiation process more complex.\n\nThe difficulty in the US position is that many other countries are allowed to enrich uranium domestically, while Israel has an undeclared nuclear programme. But the US argues Iran\u2019s record of non-disclosure of its nuclear programme and high levels of enrichment make the Tehran regime a special case.",

        "body": "The US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, plans to reduce the number of flights in and out of the Newark Liberty international airport for the \u201cnext several weeks\u201d, as the facility \u2013 one of the country\u2019s busiest airports \u2013 struggles with radar outages, numerous flight delays and cancellations due to a shortage of air traffic controllers.\n\nSpeaking on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Duffy said he would convene a meeting with all the airlines flying out of Newark this week to determine the reduction, adding that it would fluctuate, with a larger reduction coming in the afternoons when international flight arrivals make it busier at the airport, one of the main hubs serving the New York City area.\n\n\u201cWe want to have a number of flights that if you book your flight, you know it\u2019s going to fly, right?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the priority. So you don\u2019t get to the airport, wait four hours, and then get delayed.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3.55am Friday, similar to an incident on 28 April.\n\nOn Sunday morning, a separate air traffic control equipment outage caused the FAA to implement a ground stop of about 45 minutes for Newark flights, CNN transportation reporter Pete Muntean wrote in an X post that cited an advisory from the air traffic control system command center.\n\nAn equipment outage Sunday also led to a ground stop at Hartfield-Jackson Atlanta airport beginning at about 10.40am to noon local time, another air traffic control system command center advisory said.\n\nThere has been an average of 34 arrival cancellations per day since mid-April at Newark, according to the FAA, with the number of delays increasing throughout the day from an average of five in the mornings to 16 by the evening. They tend to last 85 to 137 minutes on average.\n\nThe Trump administration proposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the US air traffic control system on Thursday that includes six new air traffic control centers as well as technology and communications upgrades at all of the nation\u2019s air traffic facilities over the next three or four years.\n\nDuffy said on Sunday that he also planned to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers from 56 to 61 as he tries navigating a shortage of about 3,000 people in that specialized position.\n\nHe plans to give those air traffic controllers a 20% upfront bonus to stay on the job. However, he says many air traffic controllers choose to retire after 25 years of service, which means many retire at about the age of 50.\n\n\u201cThese are not overnight fixes,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cBut as we go up \u2013 one, two years, older guys on the job, younger guys coming in, men and women \u2013 we can make up that 3,000-person difference.\u201d\n\nAsked on Sunday whether it was safe to fly in and out of the Newark airport given the various issues there and elsewhere, United Airlines\u2019 chief executive officer, Scott Kirby \u2013 whose company uses the facility as a hub \u2013 said: \u201cIt absolutely is.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the reason is, when these kinds of outages happen, we train for them,\u201d Kirby added. \u201cWe have backup procedures. We have backups to backups to backups to keep the sky safe, which is always the number one priority.\u201d\n\nGuardian staff contributed reporting",

Evans\u2019s pitch: a health-testing company that can make diagnoses from users\u2019 blood, urine and saliva.\n\nHaemanthus\u2019 pitch and those made by the Holmes-helmed Theranos share a few significant similarities.\n\nHolmes launched Theranos in 2003 after her health-testing tech startup received significant investment from high-profile multimillionaires. She claimed her company had developed technology to rapidly and accurately test small amounts of blood to provide diagnoses.\n\nMeanwhile, in a January patent, Haemanthus indicated it can use its technology to test sweat, urine, saliva and small amounts of blood for diagnoses. The company led by Evans, who has two children with Holmes, was incorporated in February 2024 \u2013 and it has indicated that it was set to begin running tests for animals before conducting testing on humans.\n\nTheranos\u2019s claims about its technology helped its valuation balloon, reaching its $9bn peak in 2014. But bombshell investigations from the Wall Street Journal revealed that Theranos\u2019s claims were largely false. The tests were illegitimate, providing false results.\n\nThe scandal peaked when the company was dissolved in 2018. Later that same year, Holmes and the company\u2019s president were charged with fraud. Holmes was sentenced to 11 years prison in 2022 for defrauding investors.\n\nHaemanthus\u2019 marketing materials, reviewed by the New York Times, show that the company\u2019s technology will use a laser to scan blood, saliva or urine from pets and \u201canalyze the samples on a molecular level\u201d. The technology then would require only a matter of seconds to detect illnesses, cancer or infections.\n\nAccording to the Times\u2019 report, the marketing materials say the Haemanthus\u2019 long-term goals include developing a small, wearable version of the device for humans.\n\nSeveral investors have already passed on the pitch, according to the Times report. But, while reportedly being advised by Holmes, Evans has been able to raise almost $20m from friends and other investors.\n\nEvans met Holmes in 2017 amid the fraud investigation that resulted in her imprisonment. He reportedly lives in Texas with their children while Holmes is serving time in a federal prison about two hours away.",

Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners, and repair and maintenance facilities based in the US also require a regular flow of parts.\n\nLutnick said on Thursday that an unnamed UK company would buy Boeing planes worth $10bn (\u00a37.5bn). On Friday, British Airways owner IAG confirmed it was buying the planes.\n\nThe hoped-for deal on aerospace trade comes after the US-UK deal offered relief to the car and steel industries, amid fears of hefty job losses.\n\nAlthough some of the terms are still unclear, the deal is likely to bring car tariffs down from 27.5% to 10% on at least 100,000 vehicles a year and steel tariffs to zero.\n\nPeter Mandelson, Britain\u2019s ambassador to the US, said the agreement on UK car exports to the US had immediately prevented job losses at Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s plant in the West Midlands.\n\nReynolds and the prime minister, Keir Starmer, have both indicated that the UK is also hoping to raise the quota on British-made cars beyond the initial 100,000 agreed as part of the final deal, as it threatens to act as a cap on exports.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "title": "\u2018It\u2019s an illogical job\u2019: Why driving a train isn\u2019t as cushy as it might seem",
        "body": "Few professions\u2019 pay have aroused such incredulous ire as train drivers: earning an average of nearly \u00a370,000 a year, going on strike to demand more, and they don\u2019t even have to steer. But if it really is such a cushy number, why doesn\u2019t Britain have enough drivers \u2013 and what does it take to join their ranks?\n\nDriver shortages have become a leading cause of disruption on Britain\u2019s railways; about seven out of eight \u201cP-coded\u201d cancellations, made the night before travel, are down to a missing driver.\n\nParts of the timetable still rely on drivers working voluntary overtime. Also looming is a potential mass exodus, with thousands of drivers recruited in boom years now approaching retirement.\n\nThat prompted the government to announce this week that it was changing the rules to allow 18-year-olds to start driving trains \u2013 two years younger than the current legal minimum.\n\nBut as recent job adverts for Northern Railway show, driving may not be quite the money for old rope that headlines sometimes imply. The training salary of \u00a326,000 rises to \u00a362,000 in three years; but the attributes required include \u201cdiligence and moral courage\u201d, \u201czero tolerance for drugs and alcohol\u201d and \u201cexceptional concentration skills within a low-stimulus environment\u201d, not to mention 3am starts.\n\nStill, the Department for Transport wants at least 5,000 more drivers and hopes that gen Z will help them meet that target. According to the DfT, nearly half of qualified drivers are over the age of 50, while only 3% are under 30.\n\nIn the East Midlands Railway (EMR) training centre, at the back of Derby train station, the new recruits are typically later life career changers, including some who work in different roles in the railway.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of ex-police, ex-fire brigade, who tend to like the rules and regulations,\u201d says Mark Letman, EMR\u2019s lead operations training manager and himself ex-army. He oversees 50 to 60 trainees a year, starting with an 18-week intensive theory course on the drivers\u2019 rulebook.\n\nTim Joyce, 53, is retraining after 30 years in the fire service. Of his new life, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s similar in many ways \u2013 you have to learn the rules but ultimately be ready to apply them in the real world.\u201d\n\nHe shows his copy of the rulebook, known as \u201cthe brick\u201d or \u201cthe bible\u201d: a hefty tome generously bookmarked with multicoloured labels. \u201cThese modules are up to 100 pages each and there are maybe 40 of them,\u201d Joyce says.\n\nLetman picks up the brick and counts through: \u201cTwenty-one.\u201d\n\nEither way, it looks heavy for a driver to have to lug around every day. \u201cHe carries it between his ears,\u201d Letman says, tapping his head with a look that suggests this Guardian correspondent will never be a train driver.\n\nView image in fullscreen Trainee train drivers go through two rounds of interviews as well as psychometric tests \u2013 on which the failure rate is about 60 to 70%. Photograph: Mypurgatoryyears/Getty\n\nThe trainees have been through two rounds of interviews as well as psychometric tests \u2013 on which the failure rate alone is 60% to 70%. The exam on the rulebook requires a 90% score to pass and driver competency is checked every two years.\n\nDrivers have to live near a depot and travel there and back when other public transport is probably unavailable. That means most are recruited locally \u2013 though in EMR\u2019s case that can be London as well as Boston. Anita Bradfield, 60, is in training to work out of St Pancras, having already swapped a career in dancing to work for Network Rail as a mobile operations manager.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d go out to assist drivers and be seeing them every day \u2013 I thought it\u2019d be good to have a go!\u2019 she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge and good learning. No day is ever the same.\u201d\n\nIf the trainees pass the theory exam, they go on to what Letman calls the \u201ctraction phase\u201d: learning the nuts and bolts of train driving in class and using a new \u00a31.5m simulator. Only then are they sent to the depot with a mentor and instructors to rack up 200 hours of driving under instruction before being let loose alone with passengers. The whole process takes at least eight months.\n\nAmong the EMR trainees, Charlie Potts, at 22, is part of the more elusive demographic the industry is chasing, having decided after a geography and urban planning degree to listen to his old man. \u201cMy dad was a train driver \u2013 and he always talked it up.\u201d\n\nSchool leavers without such connections could now be persuaded, Letman says. \u201cThe good thing now is we can go into schools and say it could be a career now, for life.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines UK Free newsletter Get the day\u2019s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to Aslef, the train drivers union, the average entry age is 34, which Mick Whelan, the general secretary, says \u201cconcerns us massively\u201d. Few women in particular, he says, want to change careers at that point in life.\n\nView image in fullscreen The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, visits a train driver training facility in Derby. Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA\n\nOne of those trying the EMR simulators, though not yet aiming to switch jobs, was the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander. \u201cThe driver shortage problem is a genuine problem across the UK,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially in parts of the country, strangely, where we\u2019re trying hardest to improve services, like the north-east.\u201d\n\nThe new age rules, Alexander said, were only \u201cpart of the puzzle\u201d but could make a big difference. \u201cGiving young people when they\u2019re leaving school or college the ability to go straight into training to be a driver, instead of having to worry what they\u2019re going to do for a couple of years, is really significant.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated the shortage of drivers: Covid-era regulations halted training and many drivers also sought a better work-life balance. Fewer passengers and lower fare revenue also left the government underwriting train companies, leaving a cash-strapped sector freezing pay.\n\nStrikes ensued and a loss of goodwill persists. Much of the railway relies on rest-day working, or voluntary overtime, and in many places, drivers no longer fancy it. But there is still demand for jobs, Whelan says. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen places like Wales recently advertise drivers\u2019 jobs and they\u2019ve been inundated.\u201d\n\nSo why can\u2019t we recruit more? \u201cIt\u2019s the hurdles,\u201d Whelan says. \u201cIt\u2019s an illogical job when you think about it, sitting in a little can, working at 120 miles an hour, relying on the infrastructure below you and pressing a little handle to stop at a point three miles away you can\u2019t see. People keep making out if you drive a bus, drive a car, you can drive a train. You can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAslef continues to campaign for what it calls \u201cdignity at work\u201d. While passenger carriages, air-conditioning and seats have been refurbished, drivers have sometimes been left in old cabs. Drivers also have to cope with sparse toilet facilities. In one tragic case in 2022, a driver was killed by another train after, accident investigators believe, stopping in a siding to urinate.\n\nAnd, Whelan says, \u201cPeople forget it\u2019s shift work.\n\nWhen you\u2019re walking down a siding at 3.20am in the rain to get a train ready and it\u2019s freezing cold, it\u2019s not quite as pretty as when you\u2019re rolling into a station in the sunlight.\u201d",

        "body": "The return of spring weather across much of the UK last week brought some rare glimmers of sunshine for the UK\u2019s struggling economy too \u2013 including a confidence-boosting interest rate cut, with hopes of more to come.\n\nAnd as Keir Starmer hopes to seal a closer trading relationship with the EU, he is urging voters to look \u201cforward, not back\u201d.\n\nYet even if some consumers start to feel the clouds are parting, it is unlikely to come soon enough to improve voters\u2019 dim view of the government, as displayed in the local elections. That may take a more radical rethink.\n\nThe Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision on Thursday was welcome, though less than wholehearted, with two of the monetary policy committee\u2019s (MPC) nine members preferring no change (though another two wanted a bumper half-point cut).\n\nThe committee\u2019s more cautious members appear to have been restrained by fears of the dreaded second-round effects. These can translate a short-term inflationary surge, such as the one now coming our way as a result of rising utility bills, into a longer-lasting crisis.\n\nWorkers respond to price rises by bidding up their wages, the theory goes. That means higher labour costs for firms, which then pass these on to consumers in the form of higher prices \u2013 and so it goes on.\n\nYet much of the MPC\u2019s narrative last week seemed to cut against this picture of the world. For one thing, a wave of inflation-busting pay rises seems a stretch in the current labour market, which has now been slowing for months. Neither does the chancellor seem likely to sign off on a big increase for public sector workers.\n\nConsumers scarred by the savage run-up in bills in 2022 and 2023, may well have high inflation expectations, then, but it seems questionable whether they will be able to translate them into chunky pay rises.\n\nSecondly, while Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are likely to be painfully inflationary for American consumers, the impact on the UK, the Bank judges, will be modestly slower growth, and weaker inflation.\n\nThe latter is because of lower global oil prices, already flowing through to the UK\u2019s petrol pumps; and the likelihood that some cheap Chinese goods previously destined for the US will find their way here.\n\nIn other words, while the Bank is nervous about a fresh wave of inflation existence later in the year, there are reasons to think that will not happen.\n\nIt may take some months for the fog to clear, but by the summer, the worst fears of the MPC hawks may have lifted, opening the way for the Bank to respond to flatlining growth in the standard way, with a run of quickfire rate cuts \u2013 a \u201cdovish pivot\u201d, as analysts Oxford Economics put it.\n\nDespite the bleak global backdrop it seems just possible that by the time Rachel Reeves delivers her second budget, a combination of lower mortgage costs, cheaper petrol and bargain Chinese imports may have helped to lighten the consumer mood.\n\nMeanwhile, investor confidence, another magic ingredient for recovery, may be helped at the margin by the UK-India trade deal announced last week; and the conclusion of negotiations with Trump, which resulted in swingeing tariffs on cars and steel being lifted.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves is right to say her inheritance from the Tories was grim. She increased taxes by a stonking \u00a330bn in last year\u2019s budget, to fund public services, and has flexed the fiscal rules to allow a planned \u00a3100bn in additional public investment. Comparisons with George Osborne are clearly wide of the mark.\n\nBut the determination to demonstrate Labour\u2019s seriousness \u2013 to voters and the markets \u2013 has resulted in some deeply unpopular policies, including the welfare reforms that ended up being the centrepiece of her spring statement, and the cut to winter fuel allowance.\n\nWell-sourced reports that the winter fuel cut could be partially reversed, were ultimately knocked down by Downing Street last week, but the fact the idea was being floated underlines how much pressure Reeves is under.\n\nMPs campaigning in the local elections reported winter fuel and personal independence payments coming up repeatedly as reasons for voters\u2019 disillusionment with Labour, which had promised them \u201cchange\u201d.\n\nEven if there is no softening of either of these controversial policies, then, it is hard to imagine the political mood would now allow Reeves to come back in the autumn with deep cuts if, as the gloomy National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggested last week, her fiscal plans are way off course.\n\nUltimately, even if the Bank sweeps in with more growth-boosting rate cuts, it may be Labour\u2019s tax pledges, with which Reeves is so closely associated, that have to give. She and her team face an anxious few months ahead.",

We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause and advise passengers to check the status of their flights with their airlines before travelling to the airport.\n\n\u201cWe hope to have all systems fully resolved soon and will provide another update shortly.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Stansted told PA Media: \u201cAll systems have now been fully restored and no flights have been cancelled as a result of the IT issue. We are investigating the cause of the earlier issue so nothing confirmed at this stage but, for background, it looks like it was related to internet access for some systems.\u201d\n\nOne passenger who missed his Ryanair flight to Rome told the Guardian: \u201cI got there two hours before [my flight] just after 6am. My flight was at 8.05 \u2013 I didn\u2019t get there on time.\u201d\n\nHe said the customer service desk had an hour-long queue. He was now trying to rebook his flight but believed they were full on Sunday. He had already paid for a hotel in Rome for Sunday night which he was unable to cancel.\n\nOne passenger, who did not wish to be named, told BBC News she had been stuck in queues at the terminal for hours and had missed her flight to Greece. She said she arrived at the Essex airport at 4.45am and passengers were queueing \u201cout the door\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "body": "Populist politicians are striking a chord with the public in their attack on \u201cthe green agenda\u201d because they are right \u2013 climate policies are elitist. So says the man standing to be the next leader of the Green party in England and Wales.\n\n\u201cWe should all be angry about net zero,\u201d argues Zack Polanski, currently the Greens\u2019 deputy leader. \u201cThe poorest people in our society are being expected to step up to tackle the climate crisis. But it\u2019s the government\u2019s fault, not the people\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nA cautious approach to net zero is inviting populist opposition, Polanski argues. Instead, we need greater government intervention and an anti-poverty agenda. Tax the rich, he urges, to produce the funds needed to shift to a low-carbon economy, clean up rivers and restore nature. \u201cThese problems are the result of political choices, and we can make different political choices,\u201d he says. It\u2019s populism, but in his view genuinely for the people and the planet: ecopopulism.\n\nPolanski has stirred debate at a time when green policies are under attack in various countries, most notably in Donald Trump\u2019s America. In Britain, too, net zero has become a flashpoint. Last week Reform UK took a record number of seats in the local elections. The rightwing populist party\u2019s energy spokesperson, Richard Tice, attacks \u201cnet stupid zero\u201d at every opportunity, and its leader, Nigel Farage, has warned council officials who work on climate change to look for new jobs.\n\nJust before the elections, a fracas erupted in Labour over incendiary remarks from Tony Blair appearing to attack the position taken on net zero by Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, and Keir Starmer.\n\nIt had all looked very different just a fortnight ago. On 24 April, a week before the local elections, Starmer took on his world statesman role, greeting leaders and high-ranking ministers from 60 countries for an energy security summit at Lancaster House. \u201cWe will make energy a source not of vulnerability, but of strength. Energy security is national security,\u201d he said. \u201cHomegrown clean energy is the only way to take back control of our energy system, deliver energy security and bring down bills for the long term. That is in the DNA of my government.\u201d\n\nIt was intended to be a landmark speech. Miliband had been facing unfriendly briefings from within the party, some thought to have come from Blair, as well as from the rightwing press, which is relentless in its opposition to net zero and to Miliband himself. Starmer\u2019s unmistakeable gesture of support left Miliband beaming.\n\nWhat Starmer did not know, however, was that while he was greeting ministers from around the world, his trusted adviser and predecessor as prime minister, Blair, was putting the finishing touches to an intervention of his own.\n\nThe next week, Blair\u2019s bombshell hit. In the foreword to a report calling for more investment in nuclear power and carbon capture and storage, he wrote: \u201cVoters feel they\u2019re being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal \u2026 any strategy based on either \u2018phasing out\u2019 fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Ed Miliband and Keir Starmer at the energy security summit last month. Photograph: Toby Melville/PA\n\nIn contrast to the meagre attention devoted to Starmer\u2019s speech, the remarks of Blair \u2013 who left power 18 years ago, and has well-documented links to Middle East petrostates \u2013 made an immediate splash. The Conservatives seized on the row with delight. Reform has been jubilant. Farage announced this week that Reform councillors would refuse training on net zero. Tice vowed to oppose renewable energy developments in Lincolnshire. \u201cI\u2019m now going to write again to [developers] saying now that we\u2019ve won these elections, you need to be under no illusion. This is war,\u201d Tice said. \u201cWe will wage war against you people and your terrible ideas.\u201d\n\nNo 10 was incensed at the intervention, timed for the eve of the local elections and overshadowing Starmer. Downing Street spokespeople batted away Blair\u2019s attack. Even amid the turmoil of poor local election results and a surge to Reform, the message went out that Starmer was sticking to his plans. A Labour source said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s words at the [Lancaster House] summit have set the tone for the government\u2019s commitment on this agenda \u2013 the party is doubling down on clean energy and climate leadership.\u201d\n\nPolls show that voters back action on the climate crisis. Support for net zero outweighs opposition by two to one: 40% of voters think the UK\u2019s 2050 target is a good policy while only 21% view it as a bad idea, according to More In Common. Two-thirds of voters want the government to either maintain its current pace on the policy or go faster. Even those Labour voters who are willing to back Reform claim support for net zero policies.\n\nLuke Tryl, the executive director of More In Common, told the Guardian: \u201cThe idea that Britain has turned into a nation of net zero sceptics is for the birds. Reform voters are more sceptical but it\u2019s not something most of them feel strongly about.\u201d\n\nHolly Brazier Tope, the deputy director of politics at Green Alliance, urged Starmer to be bold. \u201cLabour has a bigger majority than it did in 1945 to deliver this change, but Starmer also understands people aren\u2019t feeling the benefits yet,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the government must focus on reducing people\u2019s bills over this parliament, decisively cutting out expensive fossil fuels from the UK\u2019s energy supply.\u201d\n\nMPs nervous after dismal local election results for Labour needed the reassurance, with many to whom the Guardian spoke welcoming Starmer\u2019s stated commitment to net zero. Anna Gelderd, the MP for South East Cornwall, said it presented the party with \u201ca golden opportunity\u201d.\n\nPolly Billington, the MP for East Thanet, said net zero did not come up in doorstep campaigning, and she urged the government to focus more tightly on how green policies could benefit people in their local area, rather than just in an abstract or global sense. \u201cPost [local] elections, we need to maintain our commitment and tell our story in a way that appeals to people who stayed at home or switched away from us, on the right and left,\u201d she said.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Little Cheyne Court windfarm on the Romney Marsh in Kent. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA\n\nThe next few months will be crucial in showing whether Starmer will follow through on his strong words, as a series of looming decisions set the agenda for net zero for the rest of this parliament.\n\nOne will be the publication of the new industrial strategy. Many sectors of industry are facing tough prospects. The steel industry is being propped up with government help. Automotive manufacturers are worried about tariffs. The renewable energy industry has been rocked by the Danish company \u00d8rsted pulling out of the Hornsea windfarm off Yorkshire \u2013 ironically, over high energy costs driven by dependency on expensive gas.\n\nMinisters are squabbling over the flagship housing policy of building 1.5m new homes. A long-awaited \u201cfuture homes standard\u201d is due soon, which will determine whether those homes are built to the highest possible green standards. This would be good for residents, as it would keep their bills low, as well as cutting carbon emissions, but the costs would have to be paid by developers, who have tried to threaten the government by warning they may not meet the building targets.\n\nFor existing houses, a warm homes plan is due later this year, with \u00a313.2bn earmarked for a nationwide insulation programme focused on lower-income households with high energy bills in leaky housing. Green experts view it as crucial to showing that net zero plans can benefit ordinary working people.\n\nMore detailed plans for boosting onshore wind and solar power generation are also due, as well as controversial decisions on expanding Gatwick and Heathrow airports, and another milestone will come at the end of October when the government must produce a coherent strategy on net zero, after a landmark victory in the courts last year for Friends of the Earth.\n\nOne of the biggest tests for Labour\u2019s resolve, according to Tessa Khan, the executive director of the campaigning group Uplift, will come this summer when the government must set out its response to a court ruling challenging some potential new oilfields, including the Rosebank and Jackdaw projects.\n\nKhan said: \u201cThe geological reality is that after 50 years of drilling, we have burned most of the gas in the North Sea. The only ones set to gain from more production are the oil and gas giants who will export what they can and pay off their shareholders with no thought for their workers\u2019 futures as the basin declines. To win this fight, Labour needs to be bolder, not retreat.\u201d\n\nShe said a just transition for workers would resonate with voters. \u201c[Labour] needs to support the oil and gas workforce to transition to renewables and guarantee that communities that have suffered years of decline as the North Sea ages get wealthier from its clean power mission. It needs to side with the majority of people who recognise how much fossil fuels are costing us and stand up to the profiteers and their puppets on the right.\u201d\n\nBut shifting the economy to a low-carbon footing will require investment. Economists can demonstrate that it will pay off, several times over, and global investors are keen to participate. But in the short term government cash is likely to be needed, and that is where the problem lies.\n\nRachel Reeves, the chancellor, is holed up in 11 Downing Street preparing a comprehensive spending review, to be published next month, that will determine how much money goes to each of the government\u2019s priorities over the course of this parliament. Environment spending is already facing cuts, with flood defences, sustainable farming subsidies and the warm homes plan in the line of fire. With the defence budget soaking up even more resources, will anything be left for net zero?\n\nPolanski has an answer: he would fund the green transition through a wealth tax, an idea that is overwhelmingly popular in polls and is gathering adherents in the Labour party too, behind closed doors.\n\nReeves has set herself firmly against any such violations of her self-imposed fiscal rules. A wealth tax has been ruled out and she has even relented on her threatened crackdown on tax-avoiding non-doms.\n\nChiselling away at cash promised to insulate the homes of people on low incomes, while refusing to tax the rich in the way that a large proportion of the public want, is a bold strategy in its own way but hardly aligned with the vision Starmer set out last month. If the prime minister is really preparing to go into battle for net zero, as he promised, his real difficulties may lie not with Reform\u2019s surge, his own backbenchers, or even the Green party\u2019s ecopopulists. He needs to look next door.",

        "body": "Children will eat significantly more calories in a day after watching just five minutes of junk food advertising, according to a groundbreaking study.\n\nYoung people who saw or heard adverts for products high in saturated fat, sugar and salt consumed an average of 130 extra calories, equivalent to two slices of bread, the research found.\n\nThe study involved 240 seven- to 15-year-olds, from schools in Merseyside. On two separate occasions, they were shown or played five minutes of junk food adverts and then non-food adverts.\n\nSubsequently, they were offered snacks such as grapes or chocolate buttons, and later, lunch with a range of savoury, sweet and healthy items.\n\nThe authors calculated that, after the adverts, the children consumed 58 calories more in snacks and ate 73 more calories for lunch than after exposure to non-food ads.\n\nThe research, to be presented at the European Congress on Obesity in M\u00e1laga, Spain, also found that the impact on calorie intake was the same whether the adverts were for specific foods or were generic adverts for fast food brands.\n\nAnd it was unaffected by the type of advert, such as video with sound, social media posts, podcast adverts, and posters or billboards.\n\nEmma Boyland, the lead author of the study and professor of food marketing and child health at the University of Liverpool, said: \u201cThis is the first study to show that brand-only food advertising affects what children eat.\n\n\u201cWe also showed that children don\u2019t just eat more immediately following food advertising, they actually ate more at the lunch meal as well, a couple of hours after they had seen the advertising.\n\n\u201cThe foods that we served them weren\u2019t the same foods that were shown in the advertisements and were presented with no branding information. So it wasn\u2019t that they were driven to buy the particular food or go and consume fast food, it was just a prompt to consume what was available.\u201d\n\nExperts warned that the findings revealed a loophole in the government\u2019s proposed ban on junk food TV adverts before 9pm, due to come into effect in October.\n\nKatharine Jenner, the director of the Obesity Health Alliance, said the study must send \u201ca clear message to policymakers: food advertising is driving excess calorie intake in children\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cFrom October, new restrictions will limit unhealthy food adverts on TV before 9pm and online at any time \u2013 a vital step forward that will protect children from the worst offenders.\n\n\u201cBut loopholes remain. Brands will still be able to advertise to young people even without showing specific products, on billboards and at bus stops, and children living with overweight or obesity are especially vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIf the government is serious about ending junk food advertising to children, they must close the loopholes that will allow companies to keep bombarding them.\u201d\n\nDr Helen Stewart, the officer for health improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: \u201cChildhood obesity is stubbornly high, with children in the most deprived areas facing rates more than twice as high as their peers. Paediatricians recognise that tackling this crisis is impossible without also introducing necessary measures such as regulations on the food industry.\u201d\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThis government has taken bold action to end junk food ads targeted at children on TV and online, which will reduce the number living with obesity by 20,000 and deliver health benefits to the economy worth \u00a32bn.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraging the industry to focus on healthier options by allowing companies to advertise healthier alternatives in identified categories.\u201d",

        "title": "Trump will destroy world trade, but democracies can defend themselves \u2013 and each other | Anders Fogh Rasmussen",
        "body": "The postwar global economic order, with the United States at its centre, has created more prosperity than any other period in human history. Yet as Donald Trump takes a sledgehammer to that economic order, America\u2019s democratic allies face a choice. We can accept the new cost of doing business with the US. We can follow the US down a path of mutually assured economic destruction with an ever-escalating trade war. Or we can find new avenues to keep free trade alive.\n\nMy proposition? I believe we need a new platform for economic cooperation between the world\u2019s seven leading democracies. Call it the \u201cDemocratic 7\u201d, or \u201cD7\u201d. The EU, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea represent roughly 25% of global GDP and account for about 35% of global trade volume. Together, these democracies can help to shield each other from the threats of economic nationalism and coercion \u2013 while also championing democracy, the rule of law, and market economics.\n\nThe building blocks for this are already in place. The D7 would draw on an existing web of bilateral and regional trade agreements and could serve as an incentive to sign new ones. Already, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, otherwise known as the CPTPP, includes Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. The EU maintains comprehensive agreements with Japan, South Korea and Canada. An outstanding agreement between the EU and Australia could be put back on track, and the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, recently stressed an improvement in the UK-EU trading relationship as \u201cimperative\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of a D7 economic alliance would be the economic equivalent of Nato\u2019s foundational principle, article 5, which holds that an attack on one is an attack on all. When economic powers threaten critical supply chains, engage in economic blackmail, or use access to their markets as leverage, they\u2019re counting on isolating vulnerable countries. After Canada honoured its extradition treaty with the US and detained a Huawei executive, for example, Canadian exports of pork and canola were banned from China. Australia\u2019s trade with its Pacific neighbour was frozen after Canberra suggested an inquiry into the origins of the Covid pandemic, and South Korean companies have paid the price for decisions made in Seoul that displeased Beijing.\n\nThe D7\u2019s article 5 would ensure that coercion against one D7 member triggers an immediate, proportional response from all. This would fundamentally alter the calculus of those who wield their economic might as a weapon. The D7\u2019s mandate could also extend beyond defensive measures. It could create new frameworks for secure supply chains in critical sectors like semiconductors, rare earth minerals, medical supplies and green technologies. When one member faces shortages, others could provide priority access. Joint investment in production could ensure resilience against future disruptions of the kind we saw during the pandemic, and following Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTogether, D7 members could build a coherent, streamlined trading zone: reducing tariffs, removing bureaucratic hurdles, and establishing new standards based on shared values. Doing so would enhance our collective negotiating power when dealing with the US and China. When setting collective standards on emerging technologies like AI, for example, a D7\u2019s collective economic weight would help prevent global rules being dictated by autocrats or tech oligarchs.\n\nBut no alliance is made stronger by becoming a closed club. While seven could serve as a starting point, the door should remain open to those who share these democratic values and are willing to support rules-based trade and prevent economic coercion, be they from Asia, Africa, Latin America, or elsewhere.\n\nTrue, a D7 would be an undoubtedly complex undertaking. Any number of politicians and vested interests could raise concerns about agricultural policies or regulatory approaches. Europe can seldom find unanimity, and there is also the fact of Brexit to contend with. But the global economic order that has benefited the world\u2019s democracies is today facing an existential threat. If this order continues to fragment, democracies will be left at the whims of Trump and Xi Jinping. That\u2019s why democracies need to stand together. Even while we grapple with this painful new reality, we must not forget: we still maintain the power to shape it.",

        "title": "Trump wants tariffs on \u2018foreign\u2019 movies. But there\u2019s a reason no one wants to shoot in LA",
        "body": "Two more top-notch ideas from the twisted mind of Donald Trump: reopening Alcatraz prison (currently a very wet, very old tourist attraction) and applying a 100% tariff on motion pictures made in \u201cForeign Lands\u201d.\n\nSomehow, I think these two things are related. Some have speculated that the president hatched his scheme to revitalize the island jail in the middle of San Francisco Bay after watching the Clint Eastwood film Escape from Alcatraz on PBS. That feels plausible, though it\u2019s a bit odd that his epiphany about Alcatraz would come from watching a movie about a daring escape with a convicted criminal for a hero. Was The Rock not on that night?\n\nIf Escape from Alcatraz had been produced in 2025, the crew probably would not have filmed in the real prison at all. Or in San Francisco. Or in California. Or in the United States of America. Chances are, the movie would have been shot in Bulgaria or New Zealand because of generous tax credits and incentives that have lured countless productions away from the traditional center of cinematic gravity: Los Angeles. No one is more eager to leave Los Angeles than the movie business, except for maybe OJ Simpson in 1994.\n\nThe non-profit group FilmLA found that filming in Los Angeles is down 30% in the last year and 50% compared with the previous five-year average. Shooting in \u201cForeign Lands\u201d, as Trump referred to every other country in the world, is cheaper and more efficient. Countries such as Australia make every possible concession to shoot American blockbusters in their backyard. Australia offers a 30% tax rebate to big-budget productions, on top of any state or municipal incentives, which is nearly irresistible to an American movie studio looking to control costs.\n\nBut a Trump tariff on films shot outside the United States would wipe that competitive advantage away completely. Trump\u2019s Truth Social post on the subject didn\u2019t specify how one would levy this tariff, but regardless of how it\u2019s actually implemented, the idea goes that a $200m movie filmed in Australia would actually cost $400m after it screened in the US. Again, don\u2019t ask me how that works. Like with all of Trump\u2019s tariff policy, he expects this financial cudgel to compel businesses to relocate their operations to America. The best way to avoid the tariff is to shift work back here.\n\nHitting the movie studios over the head with a large hammer is certainly one way to go about change, but the other nations siphoning film production away from the United States aren\u2019t bullying the studios. They\u2019re fawning over them, helping them save money, and tempting film-makers with the chance to shoot somewhere exotic. You want to know what isn\u2019t that fun? Driving to Burbank to shoot a movie. As a proud Angeleno, I won\u2019t say anything unnecessarily mean about Burbank, but I will say I would probably rather spend three months on a beach in Australia.\n\nFilming in Los Angeles can feel like a clock-punching 9-to-5 job where a large percentage of your day is spent on the freeway. Craft services meals are often a tepid piece of chicken and a lightly dressed salad. In New Zealand or Bulgaria, meddling studio executives pop in every so often to check in, but are mostly thousands of miles away. In LA, those meddling studio executives are bumping into you at Whole Foods.\n\nI love Los Angeles, but at times, it can feel like Alcatraz \u2013 an isolating movie prison where the only way to escape is to be kicked out. LA is far more varied and culturally vibrant than its reputation as the \u201cdream factory\u201d, but when you work in the movies, it can feel a lot smaller and more provincial. Why not go to Belgrade for a few weeks? You can skip your son\u2019s private school recital. Someone else can worry about fixing your pool by Memorial Day. You can go the entire time without eating Sweetgreen once.\n\nTrump can fling his tariffs at other movie-producing nations as much as he wants, but he simply cannot compete with the paid vacation that is shooting overseas. If Meryl Streep wants to drink ouzo in Greece, she\u2019s going to shoot Mamma Mia in Greece. You can fake any backdrop or locale on a soundstage these days, but what you can\u2019t fake is how happy an actor is when they get to enjoy going to work every day. You\u2019re not going to get that glow from shooting on the Paramount lot. I don\u2019t care how much product you put in Meryl\u2019s hair. It\u2019s not shining like this in Van Nuys.\n\nIf we want to revitalize the movie business in Los Angeles, then maybe we should start by improving the quality of life in Los Angeles. Ensuring our neighbors all have housing. Expanding and improving public transportation. Lowering the cost of living so everyone isn\u2019t so annoyed at every second. Closing at least half of the Sweetgreens. The city of Los Angeles has been at the mercy of the film industry for over a century. Municipal planners and business leaders reverse-engineered LA to be a company town, often at the expense of its citizens. As that very industry packs up and shuffles off, perhaps it\u2019s time we reflect on what we gave up to shore up this shotgun wedding and claw just a bit of it back.",

        "title": "Yes, AI will eventually replace some workers. But that day is still a long way off",
        "body": "Like a lot of business people, I am interested in artificial intelligence. So I recently asked ChatGPT to give me quotes from tech leaders \u201ctelling businesses about the importance of AI for their companies\u201d.\n\nThis came back from Apple\u2019s Tim Cook: \u201cAI is already making businesses more efficient, more responsive, and more personalized. It\u2019s a growth driver.\u201d\n\nOne problem. Cook didn\u2019t actually say that. When I asked ChatGPT where it got that specific quote, the chatbot retreated and said: \u201cI apologize for any confusion earlier. The quote attributed to Tim Cook does not appear to have a direct source from a verified interview, speech, or official Apple communication.\u201d\n\nSo I can\u2019t say I was shocked when I read that a recent survey of more than 1,000 business leaders by software platform Orgvue found that more than half of those that laid off employees because they thought AI would replace their jobs are now regretting the decision.\n\nAnyone firing employees because they thought that AI would do their jobs in 2025 should be fired. It really doesn\u2019t take much research to see AI isn\u2019t at the place where it\u2019s replacing people \u2013 yet. And business managers \u2013 particularly in small and mid-sized companies \u2013 who think it is better think again.\n\nAt best, generative AI platforms are providing a more enhanced version of search, so that instead of sifting through dozens of websites, lists and articles to figure out how to choose a great hotel in Costa Rica, fix a broken microwave oven or translate a phrase from Mandarin to English, we simply ask our chatbot a question and it provides the best answer it finds. These platforms are getting better and more accurate and are indeed useful tools for many of us.\n\nBut these chatbots are nowhere near replacing our employees.\n\nBusiness owners would love to replace their employees with AI. But that\u2019s just not reality and won\u2019t be a reality for the foreseeable future\n\n\u201cAI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation,\u201d concluded two researchers who looked at the labor market impact of AI chatbots on 11 occupations, covering 25,000 workers and 7,000 workplaces in Denmark in 2023 and 2024. \u201cEmployers are also shifting gears and actively encouraging it. But when we look at the economic outcomes, it really has not moved the needle.\u201d\n\nIn most of today\u2019s workplaces, particularly among the 33m small business owners in the US, AI is not being used in any core operation. Believe me, business owners would love to replace their employees and have their accounting, customer relationship management, inventory, order and payroll systems be done by AI in lieu of them. But that\u2019s just not reality and won\u2019t be a reality for the foreseeable future. Why? For three reasons.\n\nFirst, the technology doesn\u2019t exist, and what exists doesn\u2019t work very well. Sure, well-known players like Salesforce, Microsoft and Intuit are rolling out AI features designed to do everything from processing accounts payable to sending out email marketing campaigns. But these are limited, immature and unreliable efforts. Business owners aren\u2019t going to trust any of these tools to do data entry, make decisions or execute transactions without a human being involved.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sure, buy-now-pay-later platform Klarna is replacing hundreds of workers with its internally developed customer service system leveraging OpenAI\u2019s large language model. And Meta is using AI to replace many of its programmers. And JP Morgan and other Wall Street firms are building in-house AI platforms to do the work of its Harvard MBA graduates. But right now AI is just a big corporate play. These systems cost tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars. Most smaller companies have data in multiple places and can\u2019t afford to hire an AI-experienced developer to bring it all together, even with the tools available, to create their own internal model and then \u2013 yikes \u2013 build agents on top of this messy, out-of-date and likely inaccurate information to actually perform tasks. Not yet.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that big things are coming. Of course the systems rolling out today will \u2013 like the generative AI platforms we\u2019re using \u2013 become more accurate and reliable. Businesses will give in to the loss of their privacy for the benefits AI will provide. Their AI platforms will one day be able to validate when data is potentially incomplete and inaccurate with other sources before launching into tasks.\n\nYes, the robots driven by firms like Boston Dynamics will one day be performing the work that construction and manufacturing workers are doing. Drones will one day deliver packages, monitor workplaces and count inventory. Driverless trucks will deliver our packages and autonomous forklifts will move pallets, and bots that are indistinguishable from humans will talk to our customers and prospects like our people do now.\n\nBut that day is still years away. My smartest clients know this and are waiting. Others \u2013 such as the ones in the survey above \u2013 were simply duped into believing that this stuff actually exists today. It doesn\u2019t.",

        "body": "View image in fullscreen Illustration: Ben Hickey/The Guardian\n\nFreedom of choice is a venerable American value. Donald Trump\u2019s attachment to it is, however, highly selective.\n\nOver the first four months of his administration, Trump has been eagerly promoting the expansion of choice in our economic lives. That\u2019s especially the case when it comes to our role as consumers. Think kitchens, baths and automobiles; the stated goal every time he talks about commodities has been increasing the number of options so we can select and buy what we like best \u2013 environmental effects notwithstanding. Even his tariffs are only supposed to bring temporary pain, as in emptier toy shelves, before American-made abundance starts to rule the day once again.\n\nIn our political lives, though, it\u2019s a different story: the president and his administration have been busy instituting new restrictions on both the possibilities on offer and the picking itself. As citizens rather than consumers, we\u2019ve been explicitly told our options are permanently contracting to \u201csave our country\u201d. No longer, for example, should it be possible to share \u201cradical, anti-American ideologies\u201d in our classrooms or decide how we want to be addressed.\n\nAs a result, our economic and political existences are now on rapidly diverging paths \u2013 with questions about what choice is good for, where it counts, and who is in charge of the menu at the core. What we are seeing is the emergence of a new kind of authoritarianism that still pays homage to libertarianism, but only in the realm of consumer choice.\n\nA choice explosion\n\nThere is a long backstory here. Ordinary people, wherever they found themselves in the world, once had many fewer choices to make than we typically do today \u2013 and they didn\u2019t attach as much meaning to the act of choosing either. One of the things that made one free prior to the modern era was not having to make a lot of decisions about where to live, how to make money, whom to marry, what to own or which political philosophy to back.\n\nBut over the last two and a half centuries, the range of both options and opportunities for choice-making \u2013 from determining what to eat for lunch to deciding with whom to spend one\u2019s days and nights \u2013 has increased exponentially. The categories of people given the formal power to exercise this kind of self-determination have expanded, too, even as the possibility of being able to use this power has remained wildly unevenly distributed. This isn\u2019t just an American story either. Something similar has happened in countries around the globe that consider themselves capitalist democracies.\n\nFrom billboards to human rights decrees and constitutions, choice has come to stand for freedom itself\n\nThe roots of this choice explosion extend all the way to the 17th and 18th centuries. The expansion of global commerce in the first age of empire is one major source. That\u2019s when advertisements and displays of new products in western European cities made use of increasing variety in goods, such as colored and patterned fabrics from south Asia, to develop the idea of consumer choice. The Reformation is another point of origin insofar as it shattered the unity of European Christendom, eventually putting religious and then intellectual choice on the table as well.\n\nShopkeepers, auctioneers, itinerant preachers and printers helped lead the way, alongside philosophers and novelists. We might think of all of those figures as early versions of what behavioral economists today call \u201cchoice architects\u201d: people whose job is to construct the menus of options and, often without calling much attention to themselves, establish the rules for the game of selection. Their power, even when limited, stemmed from creating the conditions for the flourishing of what we have come to experience as the \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d.\n\nBut it was the late 19th and 20th centuries that truly sped the process along, turning choice-making into a habitual part of life. Along with more to choose with every passing year came a mass movement towards imagining ones\u2019 life story as constructed out of free choices made in our free time. Democracies were a final piece of the puzzle. Though the era of the American and French Revolutions had already established elections as vital to self-rule, after about 1870, one nation after another began instituting and standardizing technologies like the secret ballot that brought political determinations into line with a range of other individualized, preference-based activities.\n\nView image in fullscreen An undated photo of a cafeteria vending machine containing cake and pie desserts. Photograph: H Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock\n\nToday \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 we shop for goods, entertainments, courses of study and vacations. We pick our friends, lovers and life partners. We vote for our favorite candidates. We select where we want to live, what we want to do for a profession (though, exceptionally, not what we do when we are actually on the job), whether to have children, and even insurance plans to hedge our bets when facing situations beyond our control. Whole sciences explain how and why we choose what we do and with what consequences. The promise is that, with our own choices, we can get what we personally prefer. And we can be the autonomous people that we yearn to be.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that the proliferation of choice has been an unmitigated boon for humanity, as critics have pointed out repeatedly along the way. Voices on the right of the political spectrum have long bemoaned the way an emphasis on choice upends tradition, especially in the moral sphere \u2013 making almost every decision into a form of marketplace transaction in which individual taste rules the day. Many on the left have agreed to an extent, suggesting that modeling life on a shop window or bazaar \u2013 in which a product, human or otherwise, exists for every desire \u2013 leads to the obfuscation of deep inequalities of opportunity and the neglect of our obligations to each other along with the planet itself. They have also complained (quite rightly) that choice is always a lot less free, in the sense of unconstrained, than we might think.\n\nStill, \u201cchoice\u201d has long been a favorite word on both sides of the aisle in US politics (and not least when the issue is contentious, like the future of healthcare). That helps explain why \u201cthe right to choose\u201d seemed like a promising slogan in the early 1970s to abortion rights defenders who were eager to find an uncontroversial framing device for their advocacy work in the aftermath of Roe v Wade. Who could object to simply having more choices, especially when the promise was that one could pick in accord with one\u2019s personal values and desires? From billboards to human rights decrees and constitutions, choice has come to stand for freedom itself. It is even a marker now on global happiness indexes; more of one means more of the other. Ever since the end of the second world war, this assumption has made our economic and political lives seem intrinsically linked.\n\nA shrinking political menu\n\nBut that isn\u2019t where we are now. Despite its sporadic and often misleading appeal to the language of choice, the Trump administration is intent on undoing this historical pact between consumer and political choice and thus of a key element of the liberal paradigm. While expanding consumer options, or at least giving the impression this is the plan, this presidency is working hard to limit options in almost all other spheres.\n\nSomething similar is being attempted by many of Trump\u2019s counterparts in other increasingly illiberal capitalist democracies, from Hungary to India, around the globe. (And perhaps this is not just a story about capitalist democracies \u2013 even China could now be understood as a nation in thrall to consumer choice at the expense of other forms of freedom.) But this disjunction is becoming especially pronounced in the US, where choice is continuing its ascent in one sphere (albeit within the constraints of an ever-changing policy on tariffs), just as it is being rapidly circumscribed, in both practice and lingo, in most others.\n\nApart from the arena of consumption, Trump is little invested in expanding individual, preference-based selection making\n\nWhen it comes to freedom of choice for consumers, which has long been offered up as the flip side of deregulation for industries, Trump and his minions are all in \u2013 at least rhetorically. They borrow cliches that are recognizable from 18th-century sales pitches promising \u201cthe greatest choices\u201d in fabrics all the way to Milton and Rose Friedman\u2019s bestselling 1980 book and TV series, Free to Choose. The argument is as much about personal liberty as economic benefit.\n\nRight off the bat, in his inaugural address this January, Trump promised Americans that he was ending the electric vehicle mandate, as well as the rest of Joe Biden\u2019s environmental initiatives, not just to save the auto industry but also so \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to buy the car of your choice.\u201d Consecutive executive orders have extended that same logic to appliances, lightbulbs, plumbing and even K-12 education. Undoing regulations that save water and energy and reduce global warming will \u201csafeguard the American people\u2019s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances\u201d. Getting rid of \u201cfederal meddling\u201d will also restore \u201cshower freedom\u201d, which depends upon Americans being \u201cfree to choose their showerheads\u201d. As for schools, in which the right has long supported a voucher system so that families can select the educational approach they prefer in a marketplace that includes religious and for-profit along with public options, the executive order states: \u201cPres. Trump will provide every available opportunity for parents to enrich the education of their children through individual choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking America Great Again\u201d thus turns out to be largely a promise about an odd kind of consumer paradise. It is not competitive pricing and affordability Trump is after. Nor is it safer or improved goods that would lead to better health and welfare. Rather, just having more options from which to pick is the new holy grail, whether we are talking about dishwashers or elementary schools. Never mind that high tariffs and protectionism will likely make everything more expensive or constrict the field of choice itself at least for a while, forcing parents to buy, in Trump\u2019s words, \u201ctwo dolls instead of 30\u201d. In fact, under pressure from the business wing of his party, he\u2019s already backed away from the most dramatic of these measures. In the Maga utopia, the deregulation of businesses, especially when it comes to abandoning rules about environmental concerns or racial equity or even corrupt practices, ultimately creates a cornucopia of possibilities for purchasers, who are going to be newly empowered to vote with their wallets for whatever products they like best. Consumer choice is recast as a fundamental right and freedom.\n\nYet apart from the arena of consumption, Trump is little invested in expanding individual, preference-based selection making. On the contrary, in the political sphere, the president seems to be looking to move the US in precisely the opposite direction. Even with falling approval ratings, he is still counting on considerable popular support for a vision of the world in which Amazon offers up thousands of potential possibilities, from movies to toasters, for our pleasure, but nativist chauvinism and a limited repertoire of Christian values curtail options and opportunities for choice in most other domains. He and his fans view it as the function of a strong executive to make both our reality.\n\nView image in fullscreen Abortion rights activists protest at the federal courthouse plaza after the overturning of Roe v Wade by the US supreme court, in Austin, Texas, on 24 June 2022. Photograph: Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to things that don\u2019t take the form of sellable commodities, the parallel framing around freedom as choice has all but disappeared from the vocabulary of this administration. It\u2019s also fast disappearing from policy itself, as representatives of Trump\u2019s brand of Republicanism challenge both the traditional understandings of executive power and constitutional protections around civil and political rights. The latter are precisely those rights outside the consumer sphere \u2013 such as religious rights, marriage rights, and rights to determine political representatives \u2013 that have been redefined as matters of choice ever since the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the aftermath of the second world war. This isn\u2019t how they are being defined by the US government now.\n\nThe ability to make one\u2019s own determinations in ideas, expression and ideology, despite some early Trump administration bromides about the importance of freedom of speech, is on the chopping block as a result of yet another set of executive orders and agency moves. That includes bans, wherever federal dollars or other forms of federal patronage are at stake, on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, the investigation of the climate crisis, the expression of pro-Palestinian sentiments, or the promotion of history, art or literature that runs counter to so-called \u201cpatriotic\u201d education, among other topics. Such menu limitations are already being felt from classrooms and laboratories to federal agencies and cultural institutions, even as court challenges are growing in number. Restrictions on people\u2019s choice of residency or travel are also more visible by the day, not least in the actions of Ice. Let\u2019s not forget, either, new limits on options in our sexual and familial lives \u2013 such as efforts to further reduce abortion rights at the federal level and refusals to allow people to determine their own identities \u2013 especially when it comes to gender.\n\nThen there are efforts to curtail voting itself, which is the primary form of political choice. Kamala Harris tried during her brief presidential campaign last year to tie support for voting rights to abortion rights as similarly threatened \u201cfundamental freedoms\u201d, though the idea never gained much traction. This administration sees things differently.\n\nElections themselves are not likely to disappear entirely any time soon; almost every nation state in the world, no matter how dictatorial, continues to enable some form of voting by citizens. That\u2019s because voting is so closely associated today with the idea that, in any legitimate state, the people\u2019s interests need representation. Trump, moreover, likes to claim a popular mandate for his actions, even as he sometimes flirts with the idea that he is a \u201cking\u201d who is unbeholden to anyone but himself.\n\nStill, the Trump administration is already eagerly suggesting that elections won\u2019t be happening in the same way as they once did, after long insisting that any Trump defeat would be a sure sign of election fraud, thus delegitimizing in advance all but one predetermined result. Indeed, as a slate of proposed new rules designed to actually discourage voting in future federal elections makes clear, much of his administration\u2019s energy in these first months has gone into trying to find new ways to limit who has access to political or intellectual or even cultural choices; to take off the table or reduce rather than increase the set of options available; and to narrow the parameters within which choices can be made and registered. What other purpose could, say, new restrictions on the due dates for mail-in ballots in federal elections serve?\n\nEven the study of choice-making, one of the great developments of 20th-century social science including psychology and economics, is now being reduced by every means possible, from cuts to whole research-funding programs to the blockage of grants for projects making use of certain prohibited words.\n\nChoice architect in chief\n\nWhat Trump is doing is not so much abandoning the idea or practice of choice as making himself our nation\u2019s premier \u201cchoice architect\u201d. And he\u2019s doing it \u2013 at the expense of both the other branches of government and much of the private sector \u2013 as part and parcel of the expansion of executive power. That is, he is using the authority of his position to grant the rest of us sets of approved options, from ideas to identities, but also continually reminding us that it is he, as the nation\u2019s chief executive, who determines who gets to choose and how and when and where. Even threats of high tariffs are meant as leverage \u2013 pressure tools in a competitive environment, so that the president can tilt the field the way he likes and remake the set of options on behalf of the US consumer. (Artificial intelligence will surely help.)\n\nThis is a new, 21st-century form of authoritarianism marked by an enduring quasi-libertarian streak when it comes to consumption rather than citizenship. Of course, the freedom of the shopper has never been total freedom. It has always been shaped and bounded by multiple forces, from the interests of business owners and for-profit taste makers to the \u201cnudges\u201d characteristic of anonymous, technocratic policy making, such as using incentives to get people to willingly choose to save more for retirement. But over the last 75 years, much of this choice architecture has become both ubiquitous and invisible, with the promise that personal choice meant personal liberty and that freedom in one sphere would be matched by a similar form of freedom in another.\n\nThe age of choice isn\u2019t fully going away any time in the near future. It is both too entrenched and too profitable. But in a sharp break from much of recent history, our political and economic lives seem to be heading in opposite directions: investment in consumer choice (even if tempered for now by tariffs) is expanding in the Trump era in part as cover for the fact that political choice, along with choice in how to think and live, is on a steep decline.\n\nSophia Rosenfeld is Annenberg professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania and author of The Age of Choice: A History of Freedom in Modern Life (2025).",

It is a phishing attack whereby people are coerced to hand over money by being told they risk having incriminating videos of themselves visiting adult websites shared with friends and family.\n\nIn one version of the hoax seen by the Guardian, the subject line warns the Microsoft account-holder \u201cyour privacy is gone\u201d. The cybercriminals claim to have installed Pegasus spyware so as to be able to secretly film the person. This hacking software has recorded the individual watching pornography or masturbating, they claim.\n\nWhat the scam looks like\n\nThe phisher says they have gained access to your devices and made videos using your camera, which they threaten to share with \u201cevery number in your contact list\u201d, or words to that effect.\n\nIn the one message seen by the Guardian the scammer says: \u201cIt is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path,\u201d adding that they hold the power to \u201cdestroy your life\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Hello pervert\u2019 email screengrab\n\nThe scam is made to sound more credible by including seemingly plausible technical details, such as the use of Pegasus spyware which is capable of recording calls or harvesting photos. The message can sometimes include a password you have used.\n\nWhat the email asks for\n\nA ransom. In the email shared with the the criminal demands that $1,450 (\u00a31,085) is paid into a cryptocurrency wallet. \u201cI\u2019ll be notified when you open my em\u0430il and from that moment you have exactly 48 hours to send the money,\u201d it says. Once the payment is made they will \u201cdelete all videos\u201d and uninstall Pegasus.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Hello pervert\u2019 email screengrab\n\nPhishing attacks are designed to play on people\u2019s emotions so that they behave in a way that is out of character, according to the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). The phisher is playing a numbers game, hoping that enough people respond to make the scam profitable.\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018Hello pervert\u2019 email screengrab\n\nHowever, the NCSC says: \u201cThey do not know if you have a webcam, have been visiting adult websites, or the means by which you communicate with people. In short, they are guessing. The phisher hopes to emotionally trigger people so that they will \u2018take the bait\u2019 and pay the ransom.\u201d\n\nWhat to do\n\nYou should not respond to the scammer as this confirms the email address they have used is active. Also do not open any attachments that have been sent. Instead, in the UK forward it to report@phishing.gov.uk, which is the suspicious email reporting service, and then delete it.\n\nIf you are tempted to pay the ransom be aware that doing so will probably make you a bigger target for scammers as the phisher will know they have a \u201cwilling\u201d customer, warns the NCSC.\n\nDo not worry if the phish includes one of your passwords as this has probably been obtained from an historical breach of personal data, rather than through access to your devices. You can check whether your account has been compromised and get future notifications by visiting the website haveibeenpwned.com.\n\nIf the email includes a password you still use then change it and if possible add 2-step verification to the account. Also make sure your new email password is strong and is not reused for any other websites.\n\nIf you have been a victim of a sextortion scam and have handed over money then report it to your local police force by calling 101 in the UK. Similarly if you need emotional support this is available from charities such as Victim Support by calling 0808 168 9111.",

        "body": "PM promises tougher visa rules to fix 'broken' migration system\n\nJust now Share Save Sam Francis Political reporter Share Save\n\nEPA\n\nSir Keir Starmer has promised to overhaul a \"broken\" immigration system, with plans to tighten English tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependents among the reforms being considered. Migrants will also have to wait 10 years to apply to settle in the UK, instead of automatically gaining settled status after five years, under the plans. Labour's long-awaited migration rules, to be published on Monday, will \"create a system that is controlled, selective and fair,\" the prime minister said. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the idea Sir Keir \"is tough on immigration is a joke\" and promised to push Parliament to introduce cap on migration.\n\nLabour have signalled the plan to raise English language requirements across every immigration route into the UK, though have not set out full details. For the first time, adult dependents will also be required to show basic language skills to help them integrate, find jobs and avoid exploitation. The BBC has been told the changes are likely to require a change to primary legislation, delaying implementation until the next parliamentary session in 2026. In a statement ahead of his speech on Monday, Sir Keir said: \"When people come to our country, they should also commit to integration and to learning our language.\" Critics have warned the rules may split families if partners or parents struggle to learn English. But research suggests that migrants themselves consider language important. In 2021, nine-out-of-ten migrants reported speaking English well, according to analysis by the Oxford University Migration Observatory. Only 1% of migrants self-reported not being able to speak English at all. But those with poor English skills were much less likely to be employed, the analysis found.\n\nThe move is part of a wider effort to \"tighten up\" what the prime minister called a \"broken\" immigration system. The changes will also end automatic settlement in the UK after five years. Most migrants will need to stay at least ten years before they can apply for settle status and begin the path to gaining full citizenship. At the same time, a \"fast-track\" settlement will be established for nurses, engineers, AI experts and others who \"genuinely contribute to Britain's growth and society\", Sir Keir said. A ten-year route to settlement would make the UK \"more restrictive than most other high-income countries,\" Madeleine Sumption, Director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, told BBC News. The main impact of the change will be \"more visa-fee revenue to the Home Office\", because people on temporary visas pay ongoing fees to be here, Ms Sumption said. A longer settlement process will also make it \"harder for migrants to settle in, because more will lack the rights that come with permanent status\", she added.\n\nBut Sir Keir described the plans as a \"clean break from the past\" that will \"ensure settlement in this country is a privilege that must be earned, not a right\". Successive governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration, which is the number of people coming to the UK minus the number leaving. Net migration climbed to a record 906,000 in June 2023, and last year it stood at 728,000.\n\nThe Immigration White Paper, brings together months of research by officials and will lay out Labour's plan to get tougher on migration in the wake of big gains made by Reform UK in the local elections. The threshold for Skilled Worker Visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, tightened from the current A-level measure - while the list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries will be narrowed. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper revealed on Sunday that Labour will change the rules to ensure care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas. Instead, firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. Cooper told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg it is \"time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad\". These two changes will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year, Cooper said.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said the immigration system was in \"tatters\" and trust had been \"shattered\". \"Labour must now focus on fixing our broken immigration system and the Liberal Democrats look forward to scrutinising the government's plans to ensure a system that works for our economy and our country,\" home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart said. The Conservative Party said that - while it agrees with the plan to end care worker recruitment from abroad - it would force a vote on a \"binding migration cap\". \"But Starmer and Labour will vote it down,\" Chris Philp predicted. He called Labour's plans \"too little\" and argued that if the government had stuck with Tory changes, net migration would have dropped \"by about 400,000\". Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said that his party's strong performance in the local elections in England was due to public anger about both legal and illegal migration.",

        "body": "The two countries have said they will issue a joint statement on the talks on Monday.\n\nBeijing and Washington have both hailed the progress made at the end of a weekend of closed-door discussions in Switzerland aimed at de-escalating trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive worldwide tariff rollout in March and China\u2019s retaliation.\n\nFollowing the talks on Sunday at the Geneva villa of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m happy to report that we\u2019ve made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe talks were productive,\u201d he added.\n\nTrade Representative Jamieson Greer, who also took part in the two days of closed-door talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, said that the differences between the sides were \u201cnot so large as maybe thought\u201d.\n\nHe also lauded what he called \u201cimportant progress\u201d in the trade talks with the US.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Geneva, he said the atmosphere of the talks with Bessent and Greer had been candid, in-depth, and substantive, echoing similar language from the US delegation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth countries said they would put out a joint statement on the talks on Monday.\n\nAfter the first day of negotiations, Trump had posted on his social network Truth Social that the discussions had been \u201cvery good\u201d, describing them as \u201ca total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner\u201d.\n\nBeijing had yet to comment Sunday, but on Saturday, Chinese state news agency Xinhua described the talks as \u201can important step in promoting the resolution of the issue\u201d.\n\nThe Chinese delegation was expected to speak to the media on Sunday evening.\n\nThe meetings marked the first time that senior officials from the world\u2019s two largest economies have met face-to-face to tackle the topic of trade since Trump slapped steep new levies on China last month, sparking a robust retaliation from Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe talks reflect that the current state of the trade relations with these extremely high tariffs is ultimately in the interests of neither the United States nor China,\u201d Citigroup global chief economist Nathan Sheets told news agency AFP. He called the tariffs a \u201close-lose proposition\u201d.\n\nThe tariffs imposed by Trump on the Asian manufacturing giant since the start of the year currently total 145 percent, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245 percent.\n\nKeeping expectations low\n\nIn retaliation, China put 125-percent tariffs on US goods.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Trump signalled he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an \u201c80% Tariff on China seems right!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his press secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the US would not lower tariffs unilaterally, as China would also need to make concessions.\n\nGoing into the meeting, both sides played down expectations of a major change in trade relations.\n\nBessent underlined a focus on \u201cde-escalation\u201d and not a \u201cbig trade deal\u201d, while Beijing insisted that the US had to ease tariffs first.\n\nThe fact that the talks are even happening \u201cis good news for business, and for the financial markets\u201d, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nBut Hufbauer cautioned that he was \u201cvery sceptical that there will be any return to something like normal US-China trade relations\u201d. Even a tariff rate of 70 to 80 percent would still potentially halve bilateral trade, he said.\n\nAmong some of the more moderate Trump officials, such as Bessent and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, \u201cthere\u2019s a realisation that China is better equipped to deal with this trade war than the US\u201d, said Hufbauer.\n\nThe Geneva meeting comes after Trump unveiled a trade agreement with the United Kingdom on Thursday, the first deal with any country since he unleashed his blitz of global tariffs, but which maintains a 10-percent baseline levy on most British goods.\n\nFollowing the US-UK trade announcement, analysts have voiced pessimism about the likelihood that negotiations will lead to any significant changes in the US-China trade relationship.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump claimed the talks had made \u201cGREAT PROGRESS!!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business,\u201d he said.",

(NASDAQ:AKRO) stands against other best performing healthcare stocks to buy now.\n\nTrump\u2019s Healthcare Executive Order Brings a Win\n\nOn April 15, CNBC reported that President Trump\u2019s healthcare-focused executive order brought in a win for the sector. Trump directed his health department to collaborate with Congress to revamp a law allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. The announcement seeks to bring a change that the pharmaceutical company has lobbied for. Since the negotiation process is included in legislation, Trump\u2019s executive order cannot implement the change itself. However, it directs Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to join hands with Congress and change it.\n\nCNBC reported that drug makers have been working to delay the eligibility timeline for small-molecule drugs to be available for price negotiations by four years. This typically includes pills and most medications. This goes hand in hand with the 13-year wait until more complex biotech drugs are eligible for Medicare price negotiations.\n\nTrump\u2019s wide-ranging executive order also focuses on slashing healthcare costs.

This typically includes pills and most medications.

Trump directed his health department to collaborate with Congress to revamp a law allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. The announcement seeks to bring a change that the pharmaceutical company has lobbied for. Since the negotiation process is included in legislation, Trump\u2019s executive order cannot implement the change itself. However, it directs Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to join hands with Congress and change it.\n\nCNBC reported that drug makers have been working to delay the eligibility timeline for small-molecule drugs to be available for price negotiations by four years. This typically includes pills and most medications. This goes hand in hand with the 13-year wait until more complex biotech drugs are eligible for Medicare price negotiations.\n\nTrump\u2019s wide-ranging executive order also focuses on slashing healthcare costs. It comes a day after the administration instituted a national security report on the pharma industry.

The law now allows the government to negotiate prices for drugs with no competition, which includes complex biotech or biologic medications after 13 years on the market, but 9 years for their administration as capsules and pills.\n\nAlthough they did not provide specifics, White House officials told reporters that other changes to the negotiation process would yield more savings than those attained during the first round under the Biden administration. While the Biden administration negotiated price cuts as steep as 79% for the first ten most expensive drugs to the Medicare program, the Trump administration would negotiate prices for the following 15 medications. This includes Pfizer\u2019s cancer drugs Ibrance and Xtandi, as well as Novo Nordisk\u2019s blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss treatments Ozempic and Wegovy.",

        "body": "Adults accompanying foreign workers to the UK will be expected to pass an English language test and care homes will be prevented from recruiting staff from abroad as part of a swathe of new measures to be revealed by Keir Starmer to \u201ctighten up\u201d the immigration system.\n\nAmid a recent surge in support for Reform UK, the prime minister will say on Monday that overseas arrivals should commit \u201cto learning our language\u201d and will promise to overhaul a \u201cbroken system\u201d that encourages businesses to \u201cbring in lower-paid workers\u201d.\n\nThe government will also end the right of foreign workers to automatically apply for settlement in the UK after five years, instead extending their wait to a 10-year requirement, the prime minister will say.\n\nThe announcements are part of Labour\u2019s long-awaited white paper on immigration to be put before parliament on Monday, and follow the electoral success of Nigel Farage\u2019s party in the local elections this month.\n\nAlso included will be plans to deport more foreign criminals, tell employers they must train UK staff and requirements that skilled workers entering Britain have a degree.\n\nNet migration, the difference between the number of people moving to the UK and the number leaving, stood at 728,000 in the 12 months to June 2024. Under the last Conservative government, the figure surged to more than 900,000.\n\n\u201cEvery area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control,\u201d the prime minister is expected to say on Monday.\n\nIn language more closely associated with populist parties, Starmer will say the white paper \u201cwill ensure settlement in this country is a privilege that must be earned, not a right.\n\n\u201cAnd when people come to our country, they should also commit to integration and to learning our language.\u201d\n\nEvery adult accompanying a worker into the UK will be expected to pass an online English Level A1 test, which demands understanding of everyday expressions, and seeks questions and answers on simple personal details such as where he or she lives.\n\nIf workers apply for an extension to a visa, their dependants will be expected to pass the more advanced English A2 test. If they apply for settlement, they will be expected to pass a B2 exam, which requires them to understand \u201ccomplex text on both concrete and abstract topics\u201d and \u201cinteract with a degree of fluency and spontaneity\u201d.\n\nEnglish language requirements across every immigration route will be raised at some point in the future, sources said, which could force people who arrive in the UK from war zones to be tested on language skills before being granted permission to enter the UK.\n\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, said on Sunday that the care worker visa would be closed for overseas recruitment under proposals in the white paper.\n\nAsked by the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg where care homes would recruit staff from, Cooper said companies should recruit from a pool of people who came as care workers in good faith but had been \u201cexploited\u201d by unscrupulous employers.\n\n\u201cCare companies should be recruiting from those workers. They can also extend existing visas. They could recruit as well from people who are on other visas, who are already here. But we do think it\u2019s time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad,\u201d she said.\n\nCooper declined to set a specific target for net migration, but said ministers believed changes to certain visas could result in \u201cup to 50,000 fewer lower-skilled visas\u201d over the next year.\n\nAt present, foreign criminals are only reported to the Home Office if they receive a jail sentence and only those given a year behind bars are usually considered for deportation.\n\nUnder new arrangements, the Home Office will be informed of all foreign nationals convicted of offences \u2013 not just those who receive prison sentences \u2013 and will be able to use wider removal powers on other crimes, including swifter action to remove people who have recently arrived in the country but already committed crimes.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sectors targeted by the government include engineering and IT.\n\nIt is expected that work visas will be strictly time-limited for most jobs that do not need graduate-level skills.\n\nForeign students who have studied for degrees in the UK will face tighter rules over their right to remain after finishing university.\n\nMinisters also plan to introduce a Labour Market Evidence Group, made up of officials from industry and skills bodies, as well as from the government and the Migration Advisory Council. It would, the Home Office said, \u201cinform understanding of where sectors are overly reliant on overseas labour and reverse underinvestment in domestic skills\u201d.\n\nAs well as winning control of 10 councils on 1 May, Reform UK, which is promising an effective freeze on most migration, is topping most polls of national voter preference.\n\nReacting to the proposals, Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s right that ministers look to address concern over immigration but the public wants principled competence rather than populist performance.\u201d\n\nCare England, which represents care homes, has labelled the changes to care visas a \u201ccrushing blow to an already fragile sector\u201d, while Unison has linked \u201chostile language\u201d to a \u201cfall off a cliff\u201d for applications for care visas.\n\nMartin Green, Care England\u2019s chief executive accused the government of \u201ckicking us while we\u2019re already down\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor years, the sector has been propping itself up with dwindling resources, rising costs and mounting vacancies,\u201d he said.\u201cInternational recruitment wasn\u2019t a silver bullet, but it was a lifeline. Taking it away now, with no warning, no funding, and no alternative, is not just shortsighted \u2013 it\u2019s cruel.\u201d\n\nChristina McAnea, general secretary of the Unison union, said that the \u201cNHS and the care sector would have collapsed long ago without the thousands of workers who\u2019ve come to the UK from overseas\u201d.",

        "body": "The publication of the 69-page white paper entitled Restoring Control Over the Immigration System on Monday marks a major departure for Keir Starmer\u2019s government as it attempts to combat Reform UK\u2019s surge in the polls.\n\nIts package of changes is meant to rebuild a link between the immigration system and the labour market, and to ensure that homegrown workers have enough skills so that overseas workers are not needed to fill posts.\n\nIt will challenge a central tenet of Labour\u2019s economic policies for decades: that immigration is broadly good because it helps the economy to grow.\n\nGovernment insiders say that the \u201cfailed free market experiment\u201d of allowing overseas workers to freely enter the UK has been a major factor in generating political chaos over the past decade.\n\nIn his insistence that foreign workers should learn \u201cour language\u201d, Keir Starmer appears to have adopted elements of the populist language once closely associated with Nigel Farage.\n\nIt is the kind of language that generated criticism from Labour politicians when used by the Reform UK leader more than a decade ago.\n\nThen, as Ukip leader, Nigel Farage said parts of the UK had become unrecognisable due to the impact of mass migration and said he felt \u201cawkward\u201d on a train journey in central London when he heard only foreign languages spoken by fellow passengers.\n\n\u201cI wonder what\u2019s really going on,\u201d Farage told Ukip\u2019s spring conference in 2014. \u201cThat does not mean one is anti-immigration. We\u2019re not anti-immigration, we want immigration, but we do absolutely believe we should be able to judge it both on quantity and quality.\u201d\n\nEleven years later, and Starmer appears to have moved towards Farage\u2019s policy suggestions and adopted elements of his rhetorical style. The prime minister will announce on Monday \u201can end to Britain\u2019s failed experiment in open borders that saw migration soar to 1 million a year\u201d.\n\nWhen people come to \u201cour\u201d country, they should \u201ccommit to integration\u201d, he will say, and call for the government to \u201ctake control\u201d.\n\n\u201cEvery area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control. Enforcement will be tougher than ever and migration numbers will fall,\u201d he will say.\n\nPast party leaders have attempted to adopt a muscular attitude towards ensuring that the international jobs market did not undercut domestic workers.\n\nAs prime minister, Gordon Brown was criticised by his own backbenchers and the then opposition leader David Cameron for being \u201cprotectionist\u201d after adopting the phrase \u201cBritish jobs for British workers\u201d.\n\nEd Miliband was condemned for pandering to \u201cthe lowest common denominator\u201d after releasing a branded mug calling for \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d.\n\n\u200bThe \u200bgovernment is now facing a backlash over\u200b\u200b its plans to end overseas recruitment for care workers\u200b.\n\n\n\n\u200bOn Sunday Christina McAnea, general secretary of the Unison union\u200b, said the \u201cNHS and the care sector would have collapsed long ago without the thousands of workers who\u2019ve come to the UK from overseas\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u200bI\u200bt demonstrates that the government\u200b will be forced to face down many critics, some of whom are Labour-supporting unions\u200b, as it seeks to change the narrative on immigration.",

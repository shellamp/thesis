While this was a record share, it was still below the 10% that analysts had expected at the beginning of the year. Despite this, some believe that the EV market may be picking up pace.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Stocks That Will Bounce Back According To Analysts and 11 Best Stocks Under $15 to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nDespite the fact that overall EV adoption has been slower than expected, brands like Cadillac are expanding their electric lineup. By the end of 2025, Cadillac plans to offer five EVs. These include the Escalade IQ, Optiq crossover, Lyriq, the upcoming three-row Vistiq, and the luxury Celestiq. Cadillac expects roughly one in three vehicles it sells in the US this year will be all-electric.\n\nBrad Franz, Cadillac\u2019s director of marketing, told CNBC that the company is launching EVs to grow its business and attract new customers to the brand instead of just shifting sales from gas-powered cars.

For 2025, Cadillac aims for EVs to make up between 30% to 35% of its sales in the US.\n\nHowever, Cadillac has abandoned its earlier plan to sell only EVs by 2030. Instead, the company said that customer demand will determine the elimination of gas-powered vehicles.\n\nThis approach reflects a broader trend.

    "body": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Small Cap EV Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE:QS) stands against the other small-cap EV stocks.\n\nIn 2024, electric vehicles (EVs) represented 8.1% of the 16 million vehicles sold in the United States, according to Cox Automotive. While this was a record share, it was still below the 10% that analysts had expected at the beginning of the year. Despite this, some believe that the EV market may be picking up pace.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Stocks That Will Bounce Back According To Analysts and 11 Best Stocks Under $15 to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nDespite the fact that overall EV adoption has been slower than expected, brands like Cadillac are expanding their electric lineup. By the end of 2025, Cadillac plans to offer five EVs. These include the Escalade IQ, Optiq crossover, Lyriq, the upcoming three-row Vistiq, and the luxury Celestiq. Cadillac expects roughly one in three vehicles it sells in the US this year will be all-electric.\n\nBrad Franz, Cadillac\u2019s director of marketing, told CNBC that the company is launching EVs to grow its business and attract new customers to the brand instead of just shifting sales from gas-powered cars. According to Franz, the EV portfolio will offer customers more choices. In 2024, the company sold about 29,000 EVs. For 2025, Cadillac aims for EVs to make up between 30% to 35% of its sales in the US.\n\nHowever, Cadillac has abandoned its earlier plan to sell only EVs by 2030. Instead, the company said that customer demand will determine the elimination of gas-powered vehicles.\n\nThis approach reflects a broader trend. A number of automakers have turned their back on plans to exclusively sell EVs in the near future as customer adoption has not been as fast as expected.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 small-cap EV stocks to buy now, we reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best small-cap EV stocks. Please note that we defined small-cap stocks as those with a market capitalization between $500 million and $10 billion. From an initial pool of more than 20 small-cap EV stocks that met our criteria, we focused on the top 12 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of more than 1,000 elite hedge funds. The 12 small-cap EV stocks to buy now were then ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024.",
